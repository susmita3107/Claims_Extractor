 
# Description:
This project constitutes the web scraping component of ClaimsKG that crawls fact checking sites (mostly taken from https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles, which holds a list of reliable fact-checking sites) and generates a CSV file with a dump of the extracted information.

The pipeline of ClaimsKG depicted below

## Statistics 
See the ClaimsKG dataset website for statistics (https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/#Statistics)

## Features Extracted
"Claim" : Textual statement of the claim which is being verified

"Credibility" : Truth rating provided by the respective sites in its original form

"URL" : URL of the corresponding source page

"body" : Description provided by the source article about why the claim is true or false

"Date" : : Date when the claim was made.

"Referred Links" : References used for verifying the claim.

"Tags" : Set of tags or topics provided by the fact checking site.

"Normalized Credibility" : FALSE, TRUE, MIXED, OTHER



## Normalizing truth values (ratings) across fact-checking websites
Given the varied rating schemes used by the fact-checking websites, where individual labels often are hard to objectively apply or interpret, we apply a simple normalized rating scheme consisting of four basic categories that can be mapped in a consensual way to all existing rating schemes: TRUE, FALSE, MIXTURE, OTHER. We provide full correspondence tables here: https://data.gesis.org/claimskg/ratings.pdf

### Keywords
Claims, Fact-checking, Web scrapping

### Social Science Usecases

Collection of data from promiment fact-checking websites for the purpose of various social science studies like fake news and misinformation, claim detection and analysis



## Repository Structure


All extractors for the website listed above present in claim_extractor folder

Redis docker - Dockerfile

Exported.py - main python file

Requirements.txt- Allrelevant packages required for the project


# Data
sample output generated by the extractor module in output_got.csv and output_sample.csv in the main directory


## Prerequisites
This reimplementation runs on Python3.5+. Redis is used for caching HTTP querries in order to allow faster resuming of extractions in case of failure and for a faster iterative development of new extractors. Please make sure to have a Redis instance (default parameters) running on the machine that runs the extractor. 
 
# Environment Setup

Expected package dependencies are listed in the "requirements.txt" file for PIP, you need to run the following command to get dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Limitation
The layouts of the websites changes frequently. In that case, modifications to the code would be required
