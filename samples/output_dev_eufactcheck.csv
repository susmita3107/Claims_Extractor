Serbian newspaper Novosti quotes Vulin’s claim, made on the 5th of November: “The European Union is to blame for everything that will happen in Kosovo in the coming days. It has not fulfilled its role as a guarantor and sponsor of the Brussels Agreement.” This agreement, signed in 2013, was concluded to normalize relations between Serbia and Kosovo, two nations that have suffered a violent ethnic conflict.  Several other Serbian publications, including Borba and Politika Online, as well as the Russian news agency TASS, also cited Vulin’s words. The politician’s full quote also includes criticism towards the Kosovar government. This claim, however, will not be covered in this article. Aleksandar Vulin’s false claim in the Serbian newspaper Novosti. Screenshot taken on 5 November 2022 Escalation in Kosovo  Vulin made the claim about the European Union in the midst of the increasing tension in the conflict in Kosovo, which independence Serbia has not recognized, in November 2022. The reason for increasing levels of tension between Kosovo and Serbia was Kosovo’s decision to change personal documents and license people from Serbian people living in Kosovo to Kosovan ones, which was  announced in the summer 2022. The decision was delayed by Kosovo’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti due to displeasure by Serbians in Kosovo’s northern regions. Press release by the Kosovo government, screenshot taken on 5 November 2022 A few months later, in the beginning of Autumn, Prime Minister Albin Kurti again announced the deadline for changing documents and license plates to be 31st of October. On November 1st, the Kosovan police began issuing the first warnings to drivers of automobiles that still had Serbian license plates. Serbs living in Kosovo’s northern regions opposed to these changes, and resigned from public institutions. After this, Vulin issued his statement. It is important to highlight  that  speaking out about and criticizing the European Union is not unusual for Vulin; he has accused the EU of hypocrisy before in October 2022. The Brussels Agreement Serbia and Kosovo signed the Brussels Agreement on April 19, 2014. The High Representative at the time, Baroness Catherine Ashton, served as a mediator between Kosovo’s Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi and Serbia’s Prime Minister Ivica Dačić.  The Brussels Agreement was the first agreement signed between Serbia and Kosovo aimed at normalizing relations. Besides that, the Brussels Agreement made it possible, according to the European commission’s claim,  for Serbia to continue the conversation with the EU about an EU-membership, since a country cannot be in conflict with another country while joining the EU. For Kosovo, after signing the agreement, it would be possible to start initializing the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), a first step towards an EU-membership.  However, only the last two points mention the EU. The two points in which the EU is mentioned, are as follows: Point fourteen: “It is agreed that neither side will block, or encourage others to block, the other side’s progress in their respective EU path.” Point fifteen: “An implementation committee will be established by the two sides, with the facilitation of the EU.” No EU role? The most important argument is the Brussels Agreement’s omission of mentioning the European Union’s obligations as a sponsor and guarantor. This raised doubts about Vulin’s claim. The two parts of the document that discuss the EU don’t actually employ phrases such as “guarantor” or “sponsor”.Catherine Ashton was the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and First Vice President of The European Commission from 2009 to 2014. Moreover, she is credited with the development of the Brussels Agreement. In a reaction to EUfactcheck, baroness Ashton reaffirmed the lack of a formal role for the EU in the Brussels Agreement. Herspokesperson stated: “The original document does not include a specific role for the EU,” but then noted that “the role might have evolved under Baroness Ashton’s successors.” Ashton’s spokesperson said that Ashton herself suggested EUFactcheck reached out to the current High Representative in Brussels. Peter Stano’s commentIn turn, Peter Stano, lead spokesperson of the current High Representative, Josep Borrell, denied that “the EU’s role in the dialogue has changed.”  Stano also noted: “The agreements reached in the Dialogue are made solely between Kosovo and Serbia, under the EU’s facilitation. At the same time, the EU is the guardian of these agreements, which means that the EU monitors the implementation of the agreements, reports on progress to EU member states, and interprets the agreements in case of diverging views.” According to Stano, it is therefore possible to discuss the EU’s involvement in the agreement and resolution of the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, but not in the capacity of sponsor or guarantor. Viola von Cramon-Taubadel’s commentViola von Cramon-Taubadel, European Parliaments Standing Rapporteur of Kosovo, replied to EUfactcheck’s request for comment as followes: “The EU is indeed a facilitator in the process, as stipulated per Art. 15. It stems from the given Article, as well as the fact that the EU has co-signed the Agreement, that it is one of the parties that guarantees it’s proper and timely implementation.” She added: “The EU’s duty is to be a fair broker/facilitator of the Dialogue, to guarantee the establishment of the 2013 Agreement provisions and to oversee its implementation.” According to the MP the only role the EU has in the Brussels Agreement is to assure the agreement is implemented. Aleksandar Vulin and the Movement of SocialistsAleksandar Vulin did not respond to EUfactcheck’s multiple requests for comment via email or phone. Also three emails to the Movement of Socialists were equally disregarded.  CONCLUSION As Ashton, Stano and Von Cramon-Taubadel all have acknowledged, the Brussels Agreement makes no mention of the European Union’s responsibility as a sponsor or guarantor. This makes it difficult to claim that the EU is responsible for tension between Kosovo and Serbia, which was connected with the license plate policy.  As was mentioned, the EU took part in the creation of the Brussels agreement and still tries to regulate relationships between countries. For instance, the EU intervened in the conflict and later Kosovo and Serbia announced that they found the solution. However, the EU’s desire to calm tension between countries were not written in the agreement.  It is important to note that the Brussels Agreement is the only agreement with this name. Hence, it cannot be assumed that Vulin was talking about a different document.

1;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-herd-immunity-in-germany-has-already-been-reached/;“Herd immunity in Germany has already been reached”;2022-11-19;eufactcheck;;On September 7, 2022, Joachim Kuhs, Member of the European Parliament for Germany, declared on Twitter: “Herd immunity (in Germany) has already been reached: The infection control law is not necessary”. This claim turns out to be mostly false. Kuhs is part of Germany’s far-right opposition party AfD, which works against the government’s infection control law. His party is known to be wary of the government’s approach to COVID-19 measures. Some AfD-members also question the legitimation of the pandemic at large. Herd immunity On the website of Oxford Academic, herd immunity is defined as follows: “Herd immunity is a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection.” Taking the term “herd immunity” as a model, there is a simple calculation: Herd immunity = 1- 1/ R0. R0 is the basic reproduction number, i.e. the average number of infected individuals per contact with an infectious individual. Therefore, it can be scientifically checked whether there is a herd immunity persistent in Germany or not.  No absolute protection On the photo embedded in his tweet, there is a text element saying “Brisante Studie”, “explosive study” in English. However, Joachim Kuhs never gives a link or a quote to the proof in his post. After contacting him via mail, he gives the study on which he seems to base his claim: The study “Interimsanalyse des IMMUNEBRIDGE-Projektes zur Kommunikation von vorläufigen Ergebnissen an das Modellierungsnetz für schwere Infektionskrankheiten” (more than 25,000 participants, which is relatively representative of Germany in the context of virological studies) states that: “95 % of German citizens have antibodies against COVID-19”. The institution responsible for the study is the Helmholtz Institute in Münster. The study is additionally supported by the German Ministry of Research and Science. The ministry interprets the study in the following way: “This means that the majority of Germans have moderate protection against a difficult course of the disease”. So, protection against infection is not absolute. According to German minister of education and science Bettina Stark-Watzinger: “German states should prepare for stricter regulations, if new variants of the virus evolve.“ COVID’s variants The words “herd” and “immunity” never appear in the paper. In addition, the authors claim that even if collective immunity is reached, variants could still break this immunity: It is therefore not stable. They neither seem to consider herd immunity as impaired nor believe that the study declared possible herd immunity. A Modeling Network worked with the study’s editors. It has published possible scenarios for the continued spread of COVID-19 this winter. The scenario without a new mutation implies that the majority of Germans would have moderate illnesses, but infections would increase again according to the simulation. In the event of a new variant, the number of infections would also increase in Germany. Experts statements Prof. Dr. med André Karch is one of the authors of the study. After contacting him, he answered that it cannot be concluded that herd immunity in Germany has been reached. After showing him the claim made by Kuhs, Karch answered briefly that according to the study the claim is not a right conclusion. Prof. Dr. Ulf Dittmer, director of the virologic institute at the university-clinic of Essen, states: “All smaller and larger studies in Germany suggest a seroprevalence (percentage of a group with antibodies) of more than 95%. According to this, one must actually assume that herd immunity is present in Germany. However, genetic modification of the virus means that the presence of antibodies does not offer complete protection against reinfection. This strongly neutralizes herd immunity. Therefore, herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection does unfortunately not exist. Obviously, however, there is some herd immunity against severe COVID-19 disease in Germany. But this is not absolute!” Spontaneous mutations The statements of the scientists and experts interviewed lead to the conclusion that Joachim Kuhs’ statement is mostly false. However, one could argue that it would be not completely wrong, as he does not clarify whether he means herd immunity against infection or herd immunity against severe COVID-19 diseases. As Dittmer stated, herd immunity against severe COVID-19 diseases in Germany is existent until a certain level, but not absolute. Even if he would mean this sense of herd immunity, his claim as an absolute would therefore be partially wrong. Referring to the current law of infection safety, he says that this is not necessary anymore, he seems to refer to the herd immunity against infections. The experts all argue that this is not persistent in Germany and might not be even possible, because of the chance of spontaneous mutations.  He does furthermore not specify if he really means the herd immunity against COVID-19. As his party AfD is known for working against the COVID-19 measurements of the government the connection reveals itself to probably every recipient. Kuhs also gave us a study about COVID-19 after asking for his source, which clarifies that he is talking about the herd immunity against COVID-19. Conclusion The claim is mostly wrong. Because the infections are still rising, there can be no herd immunity regarding COVID-19 infections in Germany. The experts interviewed agree emphatically on this point.

This would make sure no more refugees would enter the UK. At least, that’s what they assert. Due to ‘the obligation of non-refoulment’, article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the need for an agreement with the country where the refugees come from, this claim is mostly false. The British Democrats are part of the British National Party. They are a far right-wing political party in the UK, known for their hard opinion on migration. Membership to this party is open only to people of “British or related European ethnicity.” In April, the British Democrats said on Twitter:  The claim made by the British Democrats on their twitter feed, april 26th 2022 (screenshot) They claim that withdrawing from the UN 1951 Refugee Convention would stop migrants from settling in the United Kingdom. The British Democrats say that this is, in their opinion, sadly not even considered by the government. What is the UN 1951 Refugee Convention? In the aftermath of World War II, several countries wanted to have clear rules about migrants. In that way, they would have some insurance about safe migration in case another World War would happen. A Convention was written down in 1951 and later updated in the 1967 protocol. There are 145 countries that signed this Convention and have to follow strict rules when it comes to migration.  Many decades later, there is a massive migration problem in Europe. Many refugees come to Europe in small and unsafe boats. A lot of them try to get from Calais in France to the southeastern coast of the UK. That’s exactly what troubles the British Democrats and their voters. They don’t want any more migrants to settle in the UK. Leaving the Convention: the ultimate solution? Since the UK is also a part of the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, they cannot just stop accepting refugees in their country. So the proposal of the British Democrats is to withdraw from the Convention. But is that possible? It’s not a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Thinking rationally, a UK exit from the UN 1951 Refugee Convention will not happen. Professor in the department of Social Policy, Sociology and Criminology at the University of Birmingham, Nando Sigona, claims that a British exit from the Convention would put the UK in a very difficult position. It’s not a very western thing to do as well. All the European countries are part of the UN 1951 Refugee Convention. “Even if the UK decides to leave the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, they cannot simply start to send refugees back. They need an agreement with the country where the refugees come from saying that that country will take the refugees back. Of course, such an arrangement is very unlikely, because that country doesn’t want their refugees back”, says Sigona. What happens in other countries? Since the vast majority of the countries are a part of the UN 1951 Refugee Convention and/or the 1967 protocol, it is hard to have a good idea about what could happen if the United Kingdom left the Convention. However, there are some countries that are not a part of the UN 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 protocol. The most important ones being India, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Indonesia. Interestingly, almost all of the countries that are not a part of the Convention or protocol are situated in Asia. But what happens with migrants or refugees in these countries? Every country has its own style when it comes to taking care of migrants. Mostly, these countries only grant asylum to migrants from a few neighboring countries with internal problems. For example: India does not have a national refugee protection framework but does grant asylum to refugees from Afghanistan and Myanmar. In Saudi Arabia, the whole concept of refugees is not even recognized by law. This means that refugees get imprisoned. After this prison time, Saudi Arabia deports its refugees. Are there any other rules that ensure the safety of refugees in the UK? There are apart from the UN 1951 Refugee Convention some other rules that make it more difficult to send refugees back. Professor in Migration Law at the University of Exeter, Helena Wray, explains: “The obligation of non-refoulment makes sure refugees cannot be sent back to a place where they face severe ill treatment. The obligation under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights not to subject anyone to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment is a second rule that makes it hard to send refugees back.” Wray continues: “Other human rights instruments are also relevant, but the problem is that it would be difficult for an individual to mobilize these rights, if the UK was determined to ignore them.” Conclusion Although it is very unlikely and extremely complicated, the UK could withdraw from the UN 1951 Convention. But, since almost all of the British political parties don’t want a withdrawal from this Convention, it would be very hard for the British Democrats to get them to exit. Even if they would succeed to do so, the UK would in some cases still have to accept some migrants because of the other rules concerning migration. The ‘obligation of non-refoulment’ and article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. But the main reason is the need for an agreement with the country where the refugees come from. Which hardly ever happens. So the claim that only the UN 1951 Convention can provide this is false.

3;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-without-the-dissenting-votes-of-the-afd-a-vaccine-mandate-would-have-been-introduced-in-germany/;Without the dissenting votes of the AfD, a vaccine mandate would have been introduced in Germany;2022-07-01;eufactcheck;;On April 07th 2022, German right-wing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) politician Alice Weidel claimed on Twitter that the vaccine mandate in Germany only failed because of the dissenting votes of her party. She refers to the voting of the deputies in the Bundestag earlier that day. According to Weidel, only 40 votes more were needed to reach the majority of the votes and therefore to establish the vaccine mandate. Checking different scenarios of the vote proves that Weidel’s claims can in general be labeled as mostly false. Only in one scenario her claims can be labeled as mostly true. On April 7th 2022, various initiatives on the subject of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination failed in the German Bundestag. In a roll-call vote the deputies rejected all four proposals. The proposals were based on a recommendation by the Health Committee. In this recommendation, the draft laws of Baehrens and Janecek were previously merged, which provided for mandatory vaccination from the age of 60 starting on October 15th 2022. While the other votes showed clear differences in the in-favour and against-votes, the vote on the compromise law of Baehrens and Janecek with 296 votes in favour and 378 against wasn’t that distinct. Weidel, who is part of the head of AfD’s parliamentary group, refers to it as the draft law of the “Ampel coalition“ which is the governing coalition consisting of the parties SPD (left-wing), Die Grünen (left-wing) and FDP (right-wing). In her tweet, she doesn’t mention that the proposed vaccine mandate would only concern a specific part of the population. Her statement rather implies a general vaccine mandate in the population. Ultimately, the draft law couldn’t reach the majority of the votes: 296 deputies voted for and 378 deputies against it. Nine deputies abstained from voting and 53 of the total 736 members didn’t cast a vote.    Out of the 80 members of the AfD in the Bundestag, 76 voted against the draft law and four didn’t cast a vote. According to Section 42 (2) sentence 1 of the Grundgesetz (fundamental rights, “GG”), a majority of the votes in the Bundestag is required for a decision. For a simple majority only the votes cast count. Therefore, only a one-vote difference would be enough to reach a majority. In her tweet, Alice Weidel claims that without the AfD’s against votes the vaccine mandate “would be reality now”. She alleges that the “Ampel coalition” would have needed more than 40 in-favour votes to reach a majority. These statements can be interpreted in different ways, which is why we will play them out in three scenarios. Considering the political views of the AfD, a scenario in which the AfD would’ve voted for the vaccine mandate is unrealistic. This is why we are not taking this scenario into account.  Scenario 1: The AfD abstains from voting    296 members of the Bundestag voted for and 378 members against the vaccine mandate for people over 60 years. Without the 76 against votes of the AfD, only 302 against votes by other deputies remain. In a scenario in which all AfD members had abstained from voting, the simple majority for the draft law would still haven’t been achieved with 302 votes against and 296 votes in favour. A majority of the in-favour votes would require less than the 40 votes Weidel is talking about.  This is why we label both Alice Weidel’s statements in this scenario as wrong.  Scenario 2: The AfD is not part of the Bundestag    Without the party members of the AfD in the Bundestag, the number of deputies would decrease to 656. According to Section 1 (1) sentence 2 of the Bundeswahlgesetz (Federal Electoral Act), the Bundestag must consist of at least 598 members, which would be the case in this scenario. As already shown in the previous scenario, even without the AfD, there would be more against than in-favour votes if all members behaved in the same way as in the real vote. For a majority of the in-favour votes, less than 40 votes would be needed. In this scenario, too, we label both of Alice Weidel’s statements as wrong. Scenario 3: Members who abstained from voting or didn’t cast a vote would change their vote to in favour    378 members, including most of the AfD deputies, voted against the introduction of a vaccination obligation from the age of 60. In order to introduce it, a simple majority of 379 in-favour votes would have been necessary. Accordingly, 83 in favour-votes were missing. Her statement that the “Ampel” coalition would have needed more than 40 votes for a simple majority is therefore true. However, the Bundestag consists of only 736 members. Since there were 378 against votes including the AfD votes, only 358 votes remained, so that even if all other members would have voted for the draft law, no majority could have been achieved. That’s why, in this scenario, we label Alice Weidel’s statement that the AfD’s dissenting votes prevented the introduction of compulsory vaccination for people over the age of 60 as true. Conclusion All scenarios are relatively far-fetched and unrealistic. The tweet is not concrete enough for us to be able to know exactly what Alice Weidel’s intended meaning was. We assume, however, that she refers to the third scenario and to the fact that, among other things, the AfD’s dissenting votes prevented the possibility of a majority of in-favour votes in terms of figures. Nevertheless, the statement that compulsory vaccination would now be a reality without the AfD’s dissenting votes is wrong, since it cannot automatically be assumed that other deputies would have voted differently without the presence or abstention of the AfD. However, the statement that the “Ampel coalition” lacked more than 40 votes to achieve a majority for compulsory vaccination is mostly true, as 83 in-favour votes were missing to achieve a majority. In terms of figures, however, those votes did not exist. At this point we would like to note that Alice Weidel’s tweet suggests false claims by omitting information such as that the vote was not a general vaccination obligation for everyone but for people over the age of 60. Because of that in addition to our perception that the first part of the tweet is more relevant we label the statements of her tweet as mostly false.

However, it seems that the author misinterpreted data from Aqueduct making the claim mostly false. The difference between water stress and water depletion In the article, the author Dylan Carter uses interchangeably the terms water stress and water depletion to describe the situation in Belgium. Yet they don’t entirely mean the same thing. While they both measure the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies, water stress includes both consumptive and non-consumptive water usage. Water depletion only includes consumptive water usage.  Tim Van Winckel is a researcher at the University of Antwerp in the department of Bioscience Engineering. He said that water depletion is worse than water stress. “Stress just means that you’re using almost everything that’s there and depletion really means that you’re making it worse over time”, Van Winckel said.  The water situation  In the article, the news outlet claims that most of the cities in Wallonia and parts of the ones in Flanders are depleting their water resources at the highest rate in northern Europe. However, as shown in the images above, this is not the case. It is true that Belgium ranked 23rd out of 164 countries in terms of water stress exposure by the World Resource Institute in 2019, making the country the third highest water-stressed state in Europe after Cyprus and San Marino. However, Flanders suffers from “extremely high” levels of water stress, meaning that the country withdraws over 80% of available water each year. In comparison, Wallonia only experiences “high” levels which amounts to a withdrawal of 40-80% of its resources. Here’s why.  Why is the situation in Flanders so bad? According to Patrick Meire, Professor of ecosystem management, University of Antwerp, the first reason for Flanders’ higher level of water stress is the population distribution in Belgium. “Water availability here in Flanders is very little, because we have a very high population density.” As of January 2021, Flanders registered a population density of 488 inhabitants/km² while the Walloon Region 216 inhabitants/km². This means that there are more people putting pressure on Flanders’ water resources than in Wallonia. Wallonia also represents 55% of Belgium’s physical territory compared to 44% of Flanders and has more natural resources as a result of being less densely populated.  In Belgium, the water resources are distributed between five river basins, with the two main ones being the Maas river in Wallonia and the Scheldt river in Flanders. However, the Maas river has a much larger aquifer, also known as an underground water basin. As a result, Flanders is extracting about 50% of  its drinking water from the Albert channel, that connects the Maas and Scheldt river, and the other half is being pulled out of the aquifer. Van Winckel said this puts stress on Flanders’ aquifer. “The deeper you go, the longer it takes for the water to replenish, because it takes a long time to infiltrate through the soil,” he said.  Another reason for Flanders’ higher level of water stress is its treatment of rainwater. For starters, Flanders has 1,500 M³ of rain per person per annum, which is considered low according to international norms. Due to its densely populated land and extensive paved surface area, instead of trickling down into the groundwater, the little rainwater it has ends up in rivers, streams and the sewers. Van Winckel said that both Flanders and Wallonia have historically not made it a priority to preserve and treat rainwater to make it consumable because of the contact it has with the concrete. Since Flanders doesn’t use its rain as much as it’s supposed to, it relies heavily on its aquifers. “We basically do not replenish our aquifer as much as we want to or need to in order to decrease the stress on the system,” Van Winckel said. Nevertheless, Flanders has been building rain tanks to use its rainwater.  Moreover, climate change affects water availability. In Flanders, the Scheldt is highly vulnerable to drier summers and lower water availability, which causes droughts. Spring is the driest season in Belgium which means that regions like Flanders reduce their groundwater availability. Nevertheless, it experiences large amounts of rainfall in the winter so this should enable its aquifers to replenish themselves if rainwater is properly treated.  Public response  Another reason why the situation in Flanders has reached this point is the scarce knowledge of the public. According to Meire “if people don’t see the problem they don’t help to implement the solutions.”  The Belgian government didn’t yet apply laws that restrict the water usage and the consequences of water stress are not noticeable on a day-to-day basis. One of the reasons is the importation of virtual water. According to ENI, the one of the seven supermajor oil companies in the world, virtual water can be defined as “water embodied in the production of food and fiber and non-food commodities, including energy”, Meire affirms that the import of agricultural goods from other countries such as Spain allows the Belgian population not to suffer from the direct consequences of water stress.  Van Winckel confirms on the gravity of the situation: “people don’t really care as much about water because they open their eyes and they see water floating and then they think it is just one other issue.” Conclusion The Brussel’s Times’ claim about water depletion in Wallonia and Flanders is mostly false. While it is true that Belgium is in a dire situation regarding water stress, the cities in Flanders and part of France are suffering more than the ones in the region of Wallonia as the data from Aqueduct and the experts Van Winckel and Meire confirm.

5;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-diverse-teams-work-better-in-times-of-crisis/;diverse teams work better in times of crisis;2022-06-30;eufactcheck;;In a recent talk about women in leading positions Ekin Deligöz, the German undersecretary of the Ministry for Families, Elderly, Women and Youth stated that mixed teams work more resiliently, faster, and more sustainable in times of crisis. This statement proved to be mostly true. “Diversity is not only a self-purpose: mixed teams work more resiliently in times of crisis, and are quicker to come to better solutions that end up being more sustainable.” This was said by Ekin Deligöz in a talk organized by the German organization “Frauen !n Führung (F!F)” on February 24, 2022. The quote was cited in a tweet of one of the other participants of the talk, the AllBright foundation. To verify Deligöz’s claim, it is necessary to examine studies of how mixed teams work, especially during times of crisis. Lack of women in leading positions is still a problem Women are still underrepresented in management and leadership positions of companies, as well as in politics. In addition to that diversity in ethnicity, religion, etc. is also not being implemented enough by both companies and political parties. To fight that problem, many countries have introduced a women’s quota as an instrument to guarantee women being represented in both politics and business life, for example Germany in 2015. A recently updated research of Harvard Business Review shows that in most leadership capabilities, women are rated slightly better than men by their colleagues and superiors. Especially significant for our analysis are resilience (how capable one is under pressure), collaboration and teamwork, driving for results, leadership speed, solving problems and analysing issues, because these factors are key elements when it comes to times of crisis. In all these categories, women were rated better than men (shown in graph below). This supports the comment of Ekin Deligöz, in terms of working more resilient and coming to solutions faster.    To analyse whether diverse teams bring more sustainable solutions and ideas, one could look at the correlation between the performance of a company and their diversity in staff, especially in leading positions. McKinsey & Company is a global business consultancy. As such, they have the means to examine the performance of firms worldwide. In a report, they researched the effect of ethnic and gender diversity on firm performance. Based on their data and experiences, they predicted the increase of the companies EBIT (amount of income before interest and taxes) when increasing gender or ethnic diversity by 10% in executive teams and boards. These results can be seen in the graph below. However, the results only show a correlation of the two. Ethnic and gender diversity aren’t proven to be the reason of better firm performance. But whenever companies are more diverse, they tend to do better as well. While firm performance cannot be entirely equaled to longer lasting solutions, one could assume that this could at least be an indication for it.    Companies that promote gender diversity in top management also act more socially, environmentally and sustainably. In addition, they achieved above-average scores in corporate management. That was proven by a study by the Boston Consulting Group of 2021, in which they showed that companies, which performed well on the BCG Gender Diversity Index, often have a really high ESG-Score (Environment, Social and Governance Score). Diversity in times of crisis Nowadays, strong leadership is essential to manage a crisis and even prevent it in the first place. That was noticeable during the covid pandemic: a Study by Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati shows that in 2020 women-led-countries managed the first quarter of the covid pandemic better than male-led-ones. According to the study, women leaders did impose a mass quarantine earlier than the male ones, which saved a lot of lives. This shows that the female politicians were more willing to risk their economy rather than human lives.  In conclusion, the statement by the German politician could not be proved to be entirely true. Because most of the studies only analyse either one part of diversity (e.g. gender/ethnicity) or one aspect of its effects on companies (e.g. innovation, firm performance, etc.) it is hard to pinpoint whether diversity really is the cause for the analysed effect. Also, there was very little research to be found on the effects of diverse teams in times of crisis. However, the results that were found are sufficient, for us, to rate the claim as mostly true.

6;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-the-belgian-labor-market-does-not-need-immigrant-workers/;The Belgian labor market does not need immigrant workers;2022-06-21;eufactcheck;;Belgian Member of Parliament Hans Verreyt [of the nationalistic Vlaams Belang party] was quoted saying, “The inactivity rate among non-EU foreigners is 44.2 percent and among women it is even 59.3 percent,” in his party’s official article. These figures are correct. However, Verreyt carries on: “Anyone who continues to argue that migration is necessary to provide our labor market with workers is blind.” This is a misleading statement that is rejected by multiple labor market experts, so we assess the claim as mostly false. The men behind the claim Hans Verreyt is a member of the Vlaams Belang (previously Vlaams Blok) political party in Belgium. This right wing party is nationalistic, calling for stricter immigration laws and a shift in policy to prioritize the Flemish population, according to the party’s official website. “The party stands up for the preservation of cultural individuality and for the identity of its own people and therefore against multicultural ideas,” the website’s “Statement of Principle” section reads. As a figurehead of the party, Verreyt defends and embodies these ideas. Verreyt was part of nationalistic youth and student organizations until he began working for Vlaams Belang as a parliamentary assistant, according to his Wikipedia page. In 2019, he was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives as a Member of Parliament for the Antwerp electoral district. Louis Lippens and Stijn Baert are the authors of the inactivity report used by Verreyt. Lippens is currently a PhD researcher at Gent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, focusing on labor economics and sociology of labor. His current research surrounds hiring discrimination and he has extensive experience in labor management, according to his LinkedIn profile. Baert is also currently a PhD researcher and professor at Gent University. Baert’s research is focused on labor economics and he has received a lot of recognition for his research, according to his professional profile on Gent University’s website. Both men hold doctoral degrees in labor economics. Analysis of the inactivity report According to doctors Lippens and Baert, they conducted this study in an attempt to respond to the Belgian government’s desire to increase the employment rate through policy changes. The paper breaks down Belgium’s labor force into three categories of workers: employed, unemployed, and inactive. In order to increase the employment rate, they concluded that the country needs to activate the inactives (unemployed who aren’t actively looking for work) because they form a much larger subgroup than the unemployed. The report lists that the data they used is from Eurostat, the official statistical office of Europe. It is a heavily relied on resource and is trusted by European countries and researchers. These authors do not have any biases that we could find that would affect the outcome of their research paper. The trend behind Verreyt’s claim In our research, we found ample data that supports Verreyt’s first claim. A large number of non-EU foreigners in Belgium are inactive. Data and figures from StatBel, the official statistical database for Belgium, supported the inactivity report and subsequently, Verreyt’s first claim. However, we talked to multiple experts in immigration and employment that refuted his second claim.  Lippens, Baert, and several other economists published a follow-up research paper. This paper clarified many questions and data points about inactives in Belgium. Lippens said that the total number of non-EU inactives only make up 9.4% of the total inactives in Belgium. There are 1,086,800 inactive Belgians and 123,000 inactive non-EU foreigners. He noted the problem is not solely a problem regarding non-EU immigrants as Verreyt leads people to believe, it is a problem Belgium is facing as a whole. Jeroen Franssen, a labor market expert working for Agoria, stressed that right now there is a surplus of jobs but a lack of people looking for employment. Data from Trading Economics, a website providing data for economic indicators in 196 countries, along with Lippens and Baert’s research supports Franssen’s claims. Job vacancies in Belgium are at an all-time high now with 196,140 jobs available as of April 2022. By 2030, Belgium aspires to have an 80% employment rate. However, there will be a predicted 5.4 million jobs available but only 5.1 million people looking for work. Belgium will either need to activate inactive people or use resources outside Belgium. Franssen thus concluded that immigrants are necessary for the Belgian labor market to work, stating immigrants will be 10-15% of the solution, contrary to what Verreyt stated. Understanding why immigrants are inactive To understand what’s meant by “inactives,” Franssen listed two main categories: those who have enough comfort to not need to work anymore, and those who don’t have the comfort to even think about getting a job. The second category could consist of someone who has a long-term illness, who needs to take care of their family, or who needs to finish their education.  Fons Leroy, labor market expert and policy maker, and Franssen both stressed that non-EU immigrants face many obstacles due to their different cultural backgrounds. Many immigrant women prioritize their family so they are “active”– just not on the formal labor market. Each source we talked to noted a persistent negative mindset that some Belgian employers have toward people of a foreign background. This, combined with the fact that some employers don’t recognize other educations, makes it harder for immigrants to become active in the workforce. This shows that there is a logical reason why these immigrants are inactive, differing from what Verreyt is leading people to believe. Leroy commented that many available jobs have a low quality of work. In that case, people with a different skill set or those without a full education (42.6% of non-EU foreigners don’t have a secondary school degree according to Lippens and Baert’s follow-up report) are needed to replace those who wouldn’t take those jobs. He went on to say that Belgium should stimulate upward mobility in the workplace by ensuring that every talent has the opportunity to have success and those with lower skills are able to evolve. By becoming more inclusive and flexible for everyone, the Belgian labor market will be able to function at its highest potential, Leroy explained.  Conclusion When quoting numbers, Verreyt is correct. We found three recent and reliable studies that provide figures supporting the numbers in the claim. However, Verreyt uses the data in a misleading way. When assessing why he would misinterpret the data, one key factor to keep in mind is that he is a well-known representative of a political party with certain anti-immigration values. Three prominent experts in the Belgian labor market contested his last sentence “Anyone who continues to argue that migration is necessary to provide our labor market with workers is blind“ and provided information as to why he is incorrect. Therefore, we assess his claim as mostly false.

One of the many protests took place in Berlin, organized by the German non-governmental organization Campact. It organized multiple protests following the invasion, but the one on the 27th of February struck out because of the high number of participants. According to Campact, more than 500.000 people took part in the demonstration that day in Berlin. The police of Berlin spoke of “a low six-figure number”. After a closer analysis, the number of participants seems to be exaggerated. The claim by Campact turns out to be false. Campact’s claim on its website, 27th of February 2022 (screenshot) The protest The first news item regarding the protest appeared the day of the invasion, the 24th of February. Campact posted a press release announcing a rally on Sunday the 27th of February at 1 pm on Straße des 17. Juni. Campact demanded the Russian government to restart negotiations and wanted to urge European leaders to take action against the invasion. Campact is a non-governmental organization in Germany with almost 700.000 followers on Facebook. According to their own website, over 2.2 million people subscribe to the newsletter. The main goal of the organization is to create political pressure through mass mobilization such as protests. However, it was not only Campact organizing the rally. It was also supported by other (smaller) organizations such as the Peace Cooperative Network and Pax Christi. According to the official website of the Capital Region Berlin, 20.000 participants were expected. On the Facebook event created by Campact only 4.000 people were said to be attending. However, not everyone is on Facebook or registers their participation through Facebook. Campact Campact mentioned on Twitter, its official website and on Instagram that 500.000 people participated. They released this number whilst the protest was still going on. EUFactcheck.eu contacted Campact to get more clarity on their claim, but received no response. Police of Berlin The police released a statement through the official website of Berlin and spoke of a “number higher than 100.000” and “a low six-digit number” in this press statement. It didn’t give an exact number, but one can assume that it ranges between 100.000 and 300.000; a significant difference from the 500.000 stated by Campact. Therefore, EUFactcheck.eu contacted the police of Berlin. It has confirmed their statement but did not provide a more exact number. Our own estimation To assess who’s right, EUFactcheck.eu decided to make its own estimation based on videos and images from the protest. According to Campact, the protestors were located in an area that stretched from Brandenburger Tor to Siegessäule, as well as in the adjacent Tiergarten park. The screenshot below is taken from a news report by the German news broadcaster Der Spiegel. The camera is located on top of Siegessäule, and at the end of the road, straight ahead, is Brandenburger Tor. What the screenshot also shows is that the protest mainly took place on the Straße des 17. Juni towards Brandenburger Tor, and didn’t stretch out onto the Spreeweg (on the left) and the Große Sternallee (on the right).  Der Spiegel. (2022, February 27): “Die russischen Mütter wollen ihre Söhne auch nicht verlieren”.

(screenshot) However, not all protesters stayed within this space. This YouTube video shows some protestors standing still or moving towards the Straße des 17. Juni. at the other side of the Brandenburger Tor on the Pariser Platz. Another video shows protestors walking on the Unter den Linden, but they seem to be moving at a faster pace towards the area the protest takes place than the protestors who are already on the Straße des 17. Juni. So that video may conclude that the area where protestors come together starts on the Pariser Platz at the Brandenburger Tor. This can be confirmed by the screenshot below, where people can be seen standing underneath the Brandenburger Tor and on the Pariser Platz.  BZ Berlin. (2022, February 27): “Über 100.000 Menschen demonstrieren in Berlin gegen Putins Krieg”. Retrieved from BZ Berlin: https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/zehntausende-demonstrieren-in-berlin-gegen-putins-krieg. (screenshot) On the other end of the Straße des 17. Juni, at the Siegessäule, protesters seem to be standing on the whole roundabout surrounding the statue, as can be seen in the screenshot below.  BZ Berlin (2022, February 27): “Über 100.000 Menschen demonstrieren in Berlin gegen Putins Krieg”. Retrieved from BZ Berlin: https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/zehntausende-demonstrieren-in-berlin-gegen-putins-krieg. (screenshot). There seems to be no footage or photos that show the other side of the Straße des 17. Juni from the Siegessäule towards the Charlottenburger Tor at the other end of Tiergarten park. So EUFactcheck.eu assumes that the protesters stayed in an area that stretched from Pariser Platz to the roundabout at the Siegessäule. Footage and images also show some of the protesters stretched out into the park. This photo underneath by Greenpeace confirms that protesters stretched out into the park, but they did so near the stage on the roundabout. It’s uncertain whether attendees stretched out further into the park. But some video footage closer to the Brandenburger Tor shows that people mainly stayed on the road.  Greenpeace. (2022, February 27). Retrieved from Twitter: https://twitter.com/greenpeace_de/status/1497917622809239557 (screenshot) How big is the area where the protest took place? In order to make an estimation of the attendees, EUFactcheck.eu needed to calculate the total length and width of the road. This was done using the measuring tool of Google Earth, but for copyright reasons the maps below are taken from openstreetmap.org. The Straße des 17. Juni from Siegessäule to the square in front of Brandenburger Tor has a total length of almost 1,7 kilometres and has a width of more or less 38 metres. This means the road has a surface of 64.676 square metres. Data available under the Open Database License. © OpenStreetMap contributors The roundabout at the Siegessäule has a width of approximately 190 metres by 176 metres. By calculating the surface of an oval this means the area is 26.263 square meters large. However, the statue itself has a width of 27 metres by 27 metres, meaning the statue is 729 square metres large. So the total area people can be standing on this roundabout is approximately 25.534 square metres large. From photos it can be concluded that protestors were also standing on the grass around the statue, so EUFactcheck has included this in the calculations.  Data available under the Open Database License. © OpenStreetMap contributors The Pariser Platz and the square on the other side of Brandenburger Tor is approximately 15.000 square metres large.  According to these calculations the total area is 105.210 square metres large. This is not an exact number, but an estimation. The Tiergarten park also makes it more complicated to measure the exact width of the area protestors came together, as there is no clear visual image that can show how far protestors stretched out into the park. How dense was the crowd? In order to measure the crowd density, it’s important to know how fast people are moving or whether they are standing still. A crowd that moves takes up more space and is larger than a crowd that stands still. Footage near the stage at the Siegessäule shows attendees standing still. Footage from the Strasse des 17. Juni shows particpants walking, but at a very slow pace meaning the area is dense. However, there is a lot of footage that also shows open areas in the protest.  Pariser Platz (left) & Straße des 17.

This can be explained by the images taken at different times during the protest and people leaving the protest before the end of the protest. Another explanation that shouldn’t be forgotten, is that the Siegessäule and Brandenburger Tor are touristic hotspots and there is a possibility tourists got caught up in the protest without planning to do so.  Nexta. (2022, February 27). Retrieved from Nexta: https://mobile.twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1497939282161451012/photo/3 (screenshot) According to professor and crowd density expert Keith Still from the Manchester Metropolitan University, people can walk smoothly and stable when there’s one person in every square metre. If there’s more people within a square metre it is harder to take a normal step, and as a result people walk slower. By analysing this video of Der Spiegel people can be seen moving a bit slower than usual from 0:50 to 1:22. But from 0:06 to 0:31 there’s a crowd that is not moving at all.This video of an attendee standing near the Brandenburger Tor also shows a crowd moving slower than usual. Another video from public broadcaster Phoenix shows similar crowd movement near the middle of the Strasse des 17 Juni. This website from Keith Still shows visual images of what a crowd looks like when there are one to four people per square metre. According to these visual representations, we believe there were approximately two attendees per square metre at the protest in Berlin on the 27th of February 2022. This means there would have been a maximum of 210.420 protestors in the area between Pariser Platz and the Siegessäule. This number can be slightly lower as there are areas within the protest where the crowd is less dense, meaning in certain areas there are less than two attendees per square metre. The estimation of 500.000 attendees from Campact seems therefore exaggerated and very unlikely. Conclusion The claim that there were 500.000 protestors is false.

8;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-illegal-greek-migrants-are-not-refugees/;“Illegal Greek migrants are not refugees”;2022-06-09;eufactcheck;;On March 16, 2022, Greek Minister of Migration and Asylum, Notis Mitarachi, claimed on Twitter that people who enter Greece illegally are no longer seen as refugees. He claimed that 70% of the people who asked for asylum where rejected by authority. So he concluded that these rejected illegals where passing the borders illegally since the government had not granted them asylum, therefor they are not refugees’. In general the claim from the minister means he considers illegal Greek migrants are no longer seen as refugees. This claim is Mostly False.  To check this we first looked for the definition of exactly when you are considered a refugee. This definition is defined in the United Nations Refugee Convention. “A refugee is someone who has ‘a well-founded fear’ in their home country of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular ethnic or social group, and who has no protection in their own country.” We then investigated the source of the numbers which Notis Mitarachi is talking about. Then we looked at how many asylum applications Greece receives per month.  The number of asylum applications in Greece for the year 2021 are stated on the website of the Social and Economic Council (SER). Greece received 40,560 asylum applications in 2021. On these numbers, the Minister of Migration and Asylum say that 70% were rejected by the competent authorities. This would involve 28,392 rejected asylum applications. Whether or not 70% of the applications were actually rejected is nowhere to be found. It is therefore difficult to rely on these figures. Nevertheless, Notis Mitarachi is the Minister of Migration and Asylum, so he could defend his statement with figures on the number of rejected asylum applications, but he has not done so. Since there is no data to claim, it is uncheckable. The 1951 Refugee Convention, a European Convention of the UN Refugee Agency, makes it mandatory to protect human rights. The treaty states that member states must guarantee the right to apply for asylum and protection and must protect people against refoulement, even if they enter a country irregularly (deviating from the rule). Refoulement is the return of refugees to their country of origin if they fear persecution. Notis Mitarachi’s ruling is contrary to the treaty, because he has handled the applications but he has seen the ‘illegal’ migrants as refugees and not as people. Therefor False. Amnesty International has investigated: “Pushback practices and their impact on the human rights of migrants’ and ‘Refugees and migrants still lack security and asylum at Europe’s borders’. Amnesty International describes the situation as follows: “Years after Amnesty International first reported pushbacks of refugees and migrants from Greece in 2013, Greece continues to violently and illegally return people to Turkey, in violation of their human rights obligations under EU and international law. Amnesty International documented 21 new incidents of summary, illegal return from Greece to Turkey, often involving arbitrary detention and violence, in some cases amounting to torture. The EU has also repeatedly failed to hold Greece accountable for these grave violations, ultimately reinforcing the practice and tacitly authorizing it to continue inaction.” This investigation therefore shows that Greece is illegally transferring refugees as well as migrants to Turkey, which is in violation of international law. Notis Mitarachi invokes international law, but according to Amnesty International he violates this law. It is difficult to find numbers of these, because not all migrants or refugees are registered in Greece. On the one hand that is logical because Greece is doing this in an illegal way. On the other hand, this also proves that Greece cannot speak of 7 out of 10 of the illegal migrants who are not refugees, because some migrants are missing. Here the Minister makes the third mistake in his statement. Conclusion We rate the statement as mostly false. Firstly, the ruling is based on figures for which no concrete data is available. Concrete figures about the number of asylum applications, but not about the number of rejected asylum applications, which is what the Minister of Migration and Asylum refers to in his statement. Second, Notis Mitarachi considers all illegal migrants to be refugees and not human beings. The Refugee Convention has therefore not been taken into account, because it states that people must be protected against refoulement, even if they enter a country irregularly. In addition, Greece illegally transfers migrants to Turkey in violation of their human rights obligations under EU and international law. That means Notis Mitarachi’s statement about the illegal migrants and the association with ‘no refugees’ is incorrect, because he invokes international law and Greece violates it, according to the Amnesty International report.

9;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-jews-are-feeling-increasingly-insecure-due-to-covid-19/;Jews are feeling increasingly insecure due to Covid-19;2022-06-03;eufactcheck;;Pincheas Goldschmidt, the president of the Conference of the European Rabbis, claims that “Jews are feeling increasingly insecure. Corona has worsened the whole situation and the inhibitions are getting lower (…).” Is Goldschmidt’s concern reasonable? Partly, yes.  On 14 February 2022, the German news website tagesschau.de published an article on the “New danger of old myths”. In essence, it sheds light on the fact that during the Corona pandemic, conspiracy theories are more publicly circulating in Germany, theories that contain an antisemitic core. Comparisons are drawn between the Corona policies and the Nazi dictatorship, which trivialises the Holocaust and its crimes. Based on Goldschmidt’s statement, three aspects were investigated more closely: The attitude of the German population towards Jews, the registered attacks on Jews, and the feeling of safety and unsafety of Jews in Germany. In all aspects, we investigated whether there was an increase in the recorded data and whether the increase is related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Antisemitism at crisis level? According to a study from the foundation “Bertelsmann-Stiftung”, the German population’s opinion of Israel has worsened significantly. In 2013, 46 percent of those surveyed still had a very good or fairly good opinion of Israel. In 2014, it was only 36 percent. The number with a poor or very poor opinion of Israel has risen from 42 percent to 48 percent. The survey suspects a connection between the poor opinion and the equation of Israel’s government with politics. In 2014, Israel’s government was heavily criticised on the occasion of the policy in the Gaza conflict, as there were many Palestinian victims. The Rosa-Luxemburg Foundation also describes 2014 as a turning point for German attitudes towards Jews. Even eight years later, antisemitism is still very present in Germany, a conclusion of a recent study from 2022 by the World Jewish Congress said. One fifth of the people surveyed said that Jews had too much influence in the social spheres of finance, politics, media or in conflicts and wars compared to other population groups. One in three of the 18-29 year-olds has such an anti-Jewish attitude. In the absence of comparable recent data it is not safe to say that opinion has worsened. Nevertheless, it is visible through the referred studies that the Gaza conflict as a political event has negatively influenced German opinion towards Israel. Since antisemitism increased during the pandemic and the pandemic can also be classified as a historical event, this could be a possible indicator that the Germans’ opinion of Israel has deteriorated because of the pandemic and its conspiracy theories. However, a clear conclusion cannot be drawn. Conspiracy theories are fuel for Antisemitism    From March 2020 to March 2021, the Federal Association of Research and Information Centres on antisemitism (Rias) prepared a study that recorded 561 anti-Semitic incidents related to the Corona-Pandemic. 58 percent involved anti-Semitic statements at demonstrations and gatherings. A result of the World Jewish Congress shows: The conspiracy theories regarding the pandemic are fuel for antisemitism. Many conspiracy theories contain a core of hostility towards Jews. About one-fifth of all respondents think that Israelians got a better vaccination and that Jewish businessmen benefited economically from the pandemic. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, it is even one in three. Hate crimes against Jewish people To look deeper into the statement of Pincheas Goldschmidt it is close at hand to also check the actual reported crimes against Jewish people in Germany. The Bundesministerium des Innern und für Heimat (​​Federal Ministry of the Interior and Homeland) publishes a report of the yearly documented hate crimes against marginalized groups. According to data from 2008 to 2021 the numbers of antisemitic hate crimes in Germany have actually risen throughout the years. A steep rise can be observed from 2017 to 2020. For example between 2018 and 2019 the numbers increased by 13 percent. From 2020 to 2021 it rose by 29 percent. This unproportional rise can be seen as an indicator for a correlation between the Covid-19-Pandamic and a general rise of antisemitic hate. Regarding the study of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Homeland, it should be considered that the data displays only cases which have been reported to the police by those affected and the crimes that have been recorded by German police. The study does not contain unrecorded cases, like verbal abuse. For example when people of jewish origin get insulted in relation to antisemitic conspiracy theories or other. This is why it is plausible to assume that the actual cases are even higher.    People of Jewish origin feel threatened  According to the core statement of Pinchas Goldschmidt, Jews feel more and more insecure since the pandemic, the article by tagesschau speaks of a “danger from old myths”. On the basis of a five-year-survey, known as “Survey of European Jewish Community Leaders and Professionals” of the JDC International Centre for Community Development in the European area, it is clearly recognizable that Jewish people increasingly no longer feel safe in their residential country. For a reliable result, the JDC International Centre teamed up with the Zentralrat der Deutschen Juden to get a representive number of German participants. It clearly shows that the sense of threats and danger of Jewish leaders is on the rise. In direct comparison, only 7 percent of Jewish leaders felt unsafe in 2008, while it is already 25 percent in 2021 and has steadily increased over the past years. Since the survey is about Jewish leaders, they mostly work in higher positions. It can be assumed that the numbers in the general population are much higher, because the percentage of people in leading positions in Europe is below 10 percent. For the very first time since the JDC International Centre for Community Development began its annual survey, the concern about rising antisemitism ranks as the most serious threat among the Jewish respondents. This statement also underlines what Goldschmidt says. Nevertheless, it cannot be precisely verified whether the collected data is necessarily related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The long-term study only shows the tendency of growing antisemitism is increasing with each passing year. When asked if they expected change in the frequency of problems stemming from antisemitism over the few years, 28 percent expect antisemitism to increase significantly. As a matter of fact, this seems like a serious problem for the Jewish population.    Conclusion Based on the studies and facts listed on the subject of “Rising antisemitism in Germany”, this fact-check cannot provide a 100 percent proof of whether Goldschmidt’s theory is correct. The data shows a visible rise in antisemitism since year 2008 and shows that jewish people feel more and more insecure. Probably the Corona-pandemic has also contributed to this, as crises in the past can often be associated with hatred against jews. It is therefore possible, but not provable, that Covid-19 is responsible for the rising numbers and has worsened the situation for Jewish people. Studies on this will probably only be available in the coming years. Until this, Goldschmidt’s statement is mostly true.

10;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-german-taxpayers-have-the-highest-tax-and-contribution-burden-in-the-world/;“German taxpayers have the highest tax and contribution burden in the world”;2022-06-01;eufactcheck;;After the German government decided in April to provide one billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, critical voices were raised, especially from the opposition. On April 16, 2022 the deputy federal spokesperson of the right-wing party “Alternative für Deutschland” (AfD) Georg Pazderski wrote on Twitter: “It is not Scholz who is providing more than one billion euros in military aid to Ukraine. It’s German taxpayers, who already have the highest tax and contribution burden in the world.” We have checked his claim and rate it as mostly false.  In April 2021, the newspaper “Handelsblatt” described Germany as the country with the highest taxes and contributions. The statements were based on the annual statistics of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to these statistics, in no other country do single employees pay as many taxes and social security contributions as in Germany. On average, 38.9 per cent of gross salary is spent on income tax and social security contributions, 0.5 per cent more than in Belgium, which takes second place on the list. Germany achieves a better ranking for families with two children. Single-earner families pay just under 20 per cent in taxes and social security contributions, which is less than in the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. For two earners, 29.9 per cent is deducted from wages. Here, Germany is again significantly worse off, only Belgium is higher in the list with 30.5 per cent.    Summarising these results, Germany indeed seems to be one of the most expensive countries, especially for singles and dual-income families. On the other hand, it will look different, if the overall economic tax burden is placed in relation to gross domestic product (GDP). In 2019 Germany, with 38.8 per cent of GDP, was ranked 12th out of the 38 OECD countries – above the OECD average of 33.4 per cent, but clearly behind other western European countries like Denmark with 46.3 per cent or France with 45.5 per cent.  However, these comparisons are flawed by the fact that in Germany social security contributions are organised by the state. This results in comparatively high social security contributions, which significantly increase the total tax burden. In other countries, such as the USA, the social system is organised privately. This means: fewer contributions, but also fewer state social benefits. If this information is taken into account, i.e. only the tax contributions are compared, Germany is below average. However, the values must also be viewed in a more differentiated way. According to the list, the Scandinavian countries have a very high tax burden, although they receive their health benefits partly through taxes. In a comparison with Austria, which organises its social system like Germany, Germany scores better.    The OECD report also leaves out indirect taxes such as value-added tax or other taxes on consumer goods. In the comparison of value-added tax, Germany, with 19 per cent as the standard rate, is clearly further behind in comparison to other European countries. Hungary is in first place with 27 per cent.    Conclusion The OECD focuses its figures on standard deductions such as the basic tax-free allowance or the child tax-free allowance. In addition, there are many other deductions in Germany. For example, the commuter allowance, professional training and travel expenses, childcare or maintenance payments which can be deducted for tax purposes. It can thus be seen that the entire issue is clearly more complex and must be considered in a differentiated manner. Only if all state benefits and tax charges are taken into account the figures of the countries can be compared. However, the different financing systems are making the analysis very difficult. Nevertheless, in an overall economic comparison it is wrong to describe Germany as a high-tax country. Only singles pay more income tax and social security contributions in Germany than in any other OECD country. Therefore the claim of the deputy federal spokesperson of the right-wing party AfD ist mostly wrong.

11;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-whoever-has-been-injected-with-that-scary-vaccine-can-claim-compensation-in-denmark/;“Whoever has been injected with that scary ‘vaccine’ can claim compensation in Denmark“;2022-05-31;eufactcheck;;On the 12th of August 2022 the Dutch far right party leader Thierry Baudet of opposition party Forum Voor Democratie responded to an article of Danish news website DR. The article was about three Danes who received compensation because of the rare side effect the three suffered from after being vaccinated with the AstraZeneca. Baudet tweeted to his 273.000 followers the following: ‘whoever has been injected with that scary ‘vaccine’ can claim compensation in Denmark. “Blood clots AstraZeneca-vaccine: all three of these Danes worked as frontline healthcare personnel. Camilla is the only one of the three that survived.”’ His claim about receiving compensation after being vaccinated with AstraZeneca in Denmark is mostly false. In this factcheck we will first be focussing on the first part of the tweet, namely: ‘whoever has been injected with that scary ‘vaccine’ can claim compensation in Denmark’. In the tweet Thierry Baudet references to ‘that scary ‘vaccine’’. We assumed that he meant AstraZeneca with this statement, because the article also writes about the AstraZeneca vaccine. It is unclear who Baudet is talking about, because who will be receiving compensation? After that we will be looking at the second part of the tweet. Is Baudets information right about the three Danes? Tweet from Dutch politician Thierry Baudet on AstraZenica vaccination. In Denmark the population can claim at Patienterstatningen compensation after suffering from side effects. This is an institution that processes compensation claims from patients. These patients got hurt while receiving treatment in the hospital, by their doctor or as consequence of side effects from receiving medicine. The ministry of Public Health pays for this drugdamage (Patienterstatningen, w.d.). The people who qualify for the compensation must have been treated in Denmark. In this case the people who have been vaccinated. This means that the Dutch do not qualify for the compensation in Denmark when they’ve been vaccinated in the Netherlands. Not everyone who has been vaccinated in Denmark with the AstraAzeneca vaccine can receive a compensation. Only the cases who had a severe and rare injury due to the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine (Patienterstatningen, w.d.). The article that Thierry Baudet used as source for his tweet originates from independent news website DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation). It was written by Isabella Tvede, Marie Allerslev Eriksen and Jim Bregendahl, journalists active by DR. In the article the three Danes that are mentioned receive compensation because of the side effects they experienced. The three Danes suffered from the VITT-syndrome. This abbreviation stands for Vaccine-Induced-Immune-Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia. This is a rare side effect that leads to a combination of severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (NHG, 2021). Baudet mentioned in his tweet that the three were frontline healthcare staff and that two out of three hadn’t survived. The article also confirms that the three Danes worked as frontline healthcare staff. On the 7th of April, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) made the conclusion that the there is a connection between the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and the development of the VITT-syndrome (NHG, 2021). Much earlier on the 11th of March 2021 Denmark stopped using the AstraZeneca-vaccine (NOS, 2021). Thierry Baudet called the AstraZeneca a ‘scary ‘vaccine’’. To bring things in perspective, we put the numbers side by side. Approximately 151.000 people had at least one vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine (Danish Health Authority, 2021). According to Patientersatingen (2022) they received 212 reports in the case of the AstraZeneca vaccine. From these reports 130 were rejected and 75 are still being processed. In total seven cases have been recognised and they have the right for compensation. This amount has risen since the tweet and the article. The numbers have last been updated on March 29 2022. Conclusion The claim of Thierry Baudet is mostly false. Whoever has been vaccinated with AstraZeneca does not automatically have the right to claim compensation in Denmark. For this the person must suffer from a severe and rare side effect from the vaccination. The person also must have been vaccinated in Denmark. The information Baudet gives about the three Danes is correct.

A situation that has left many Europeans unable to buy their own property. In Belgium, Tine Heyse, a politician for the left-wing party Groen, stated that ‘if the current housing conditions in Ghent don’t change, 40% of all inhabitants will not be able to buy a house on the private market’. EUfactcheck looked into the evidence and methods on which Heyse’s estimation is based, which turned out to be reliable. However, as Heyse’s statement is an estimation, Eufactcheck rates it as mostly true. © Het Laatste Nieuws (screenshot 19-02-2022) In an interview on February 19th with the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, Tine Heyse from the left-wing party Groen debated the housing situation in Ghent with Matthias Diependaele, minister for the right-wing party N- VA at the Flemish Parliament. When EUfactcheck contacted Heyse, she explained that her claim is based on the current housing conditions in Ghent. These include a lack of social housing for rent and for sale, skyrocketing property prices on the private market, and a lack of investment in affordable housing for rent. Affordable housing for rent is a cooperation between the government and the private market where private players rent out their property below the market price, but with more security for the property owner. If the tenant doesn’t pay the government, the landlord will still receive his money. This solution is offered to people who don’t earn enough money to rent on the private market but earn too much to rent social housing. Dynamic number Heyse also provided EUfactcheck with a document in which she explains the current housing situation in Ghent. In this document, she refers to a policy note (in Dutch) published on the 2nd of March 2021, which explains that 11 percent of all inhabitants in Ghent rent social housing, whereas 39 percent rent on the regular private market. Of that 39 percent, 48.6 percent actually qualify for social housing. This is stated in a report (in Dutch) published by the multidisciplinary cooperation of experts named “Steunpunt Wonen” in 2019. When those last two numbers are multiplied, the result is 19 percent. In conclusion: of the 40 percent referred to in the claim, 30 percentage points alludes to all inhabitants in Ghent who rent social housing or qualify for it, but aren’t able to because of the lack of social housing. “The remaining 10 percentage points of the 40 percent is an estimation and loosely based on the current property prices and income thresholds,” states Dieter Somers, member of the cabinet of Heyse. “If someone earns too much money to qualify for social housing, that doesn’t mean that he or she has enough money to rent on the private market or buy a house. Those people are included in the 10 percentage points,” Somers explains. “The number presented in the claim is not an absolute number, but a dynamic one,” he continues. “This means that someone who currently rents social housing can get another job with a better income and will maybe be able to eventually buy a house. On the other hand, someone who currently owns a house but for example gets a divorce, might lose the house and end up in a financial situation where he or she will not be able to afford another property. It is a two-way street.” Lack of social housing for sale “When we speak about buying a house in our claim, we mean buying a house on the private market”, Somers states. “Someone who rents social housing pays an average of 330 euros per month. Way less than what he/she needs to pay if he/she would buy a house on the private market.” According to the report of Steunpunt Wonen, someone who buys a house for the first time spends an average of 230.500 euros, borrows an average of 179.600 euros at the bank, and pays off an average monthly loan of 880 euros. “For many tenants, buying a social house could offer a solution. But there are just not enough social houses on the market in Ghent,” Somers says. EUfactcheck gathered the number of social houses in Ghent that were built for sale. According to figures from the Flemish Company for Social Housing, in 2020 only 121 were offered for sale for a total of 79.084 inhabitants who are eligible to buy. After gathering all the information, EUfactcheck presented this to Kristof Heylen, a research expert who concentrates on the affordability and quality of living and who is also a team member at Steunpunt Wonen. He replied that ‘the calculations and numbers provided by the cabinet, as well as the used method, are correct. He stated that ‘based on the given information, the claim is mostly true.’ Mostly, because it is a dynamic number and partially build on an estimation. Conclusion After verification EUfactcheck concludes that the quote given by Belgian left-wing politician Tine Heyse who stated that ‘if the current housing conditions in Ghent don’t change, 40% of all inhabitants will not be able to buy a house on the private market’ is correct. However, the number remains an estimation and therefore we assess the claim as mostly true.

13;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-germany-will-never-fulfill-its-energy-requirements-with-only-wind-energy-and-solar-power/;„Germany will never fulfill its energy requirements with only wind energy and solar power.“;2022-05-27;eufactcheck;;On March 26th 2022, Stephan Brandner, Deputy Federal Spokesperson of the right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), posted a press release on Instagram in which he claims that Germany will never fulfill its energy demand with only wind energy and solar power. Different studies have proven that this statement is false. In the past the AfD has often fought to reverse the energy transition and continue to support nuclear and coal-fired power stations. Their election program says: “A complete change of our energy supply to volatile “renewable” energy sources is unecological, unrealistic and therefore to be rejected.” In his press release Stephan Brandner also speaks of “a lack of base load capability.” Technologies that produce energy on a permanent basis are called base-load capable. Unlike renewable energies, fossil fuels are not dependent on sun, water or wind. However, experts are realizing that baseload capability will become less and less important in the future. The German Climate Consortium (DKK) comments: “The dark period, so the lack of energy supply due to both calm conditions and no sunshine, is a manageable risk in times of network-controlled supra-regional and trans-European energy supply. “ How much energy does Germany currently need and where does it come from? In 2020 Germany’s final energy consumption from industry, transport, households and commerce was 8341 petajoules (PJ), which is equivalent to 2316 terawatt hours (TWh). This energy came from two different sources: 943 TWh were generated by renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy domestically and more than three times as much (3428 TWh) were imported from abroad. Let’s have a look at the power generation in Germany. First of all it is not only about electricity. In fact, three energy sectors must be considered altogether: Electricity, heat and mobility. In 2020 half of the energy produced domestically was generated by electricity.    In 2020 the share of renewables in net electricity generation exceeded 50 percent for the first time. Net electricity generation is the result of gross electricity generation minus the power plant’s own consumption. This amount is the actual electricity mix that comes out of the electrical outlet at home or is used to charge an electric vehicle. However, according to the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection, the three energy sectors of electricity, heat and mobility will still change quite a bit. With more and more electric cars on the streets, the electricity consumption will increase, which will also reduce the required amount of energy for mobility. Is it possible to generate the energy we need from renewable sources like wind energy and solar power? Yes. The Federal Environment Office classifies 13.8% of Germany’s land area as technically and ecologically usable for wind turbine technology. This could generate 2900 TWh per year. However, the actual potential is much lower. In reality economic conditions, beneficiary claims and low acceptance among the citizens must be taken into account. Despite these limitations, wind energy plays a central role in the energy transition in addition to solar power and other renewable energy sources. If photovoltaic systems (PV) are installed not only on rooftops, but also on agricultural land, artificial lakes, facades, parking lots, roads, noise barriers and even vehicles, there is more than enough surface area for strong expansion of PV systems. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems estimates the technical potential of PV systems at 3160 GW. The performance ratio indicates the efficiency of a photovoltaic system. The higher this value, the better the quality of the system. A different study shows that nowadays modern photovoltaic systems have a performance ratio of 80%. On average they reach full performance 910 hours per year. Multiplying the 3160 GW technical potential with the performance ratio of 80% with the full performance of 910 hours, we get a total energy production of 2300480 GWh or 2300 TWh. 3160 GW * 0,8 * 910 h = 2300480 GWh Theoretically, the combination of wind turbines and solar panels could generate a total of more than 5000 TWh of energy alone. That is more than twice as much as the final energy consumption in 2020. But realistically, would that be possible? We currently consume 550 to 580 TWh of electricity each year. The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection estimates that this consumption will increase to at least 800 to 900 TWh by 2050 because of the change of the energy sectors. This is why a major expansion of solar and wind energy is necessary. Especially wind energy is an important element. However, considering the current objections of politics, economy and the citizens, the realistic potential of wind power is much lower than in theory. Nevertheless, it is still possible to cover Germany’s entire energy consumption through renewable energy. In the study “100% Renewable Energies for Electricity and Heat in Germany”, scientists of The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems describe how a reduced energy consumption can be covered in the future. According to the scientists, four steps are necessary to reduce the energy consumption: Reduction of the heating demand of the building sector by 50% compared to 2010.Reduction of fuel consumption in industry by 30%.Switch from today’s fuel-based transportation to electricity-based transportation (50% battery and 50% hydrogen). Reduction of the non-energy electricity consumption by 30%.    This figure shows how a reduced energy consumption could be covered by renewable energies. The left diagram shows the energy consumption of the different energy sectors in TWh. The right diagram shows the energy production of the different renewable energy sources. It is shown that a reduced energy consumption can be covered entirely by renewable energies. However, most likely Germany will continue to import energy, as there are simply more affordable and more efficient locations for renewable energy outside of the country. For this reason, a well-developed energy network within Europe is necessary. Conclusion Stephan Brander did not include any references in his statement, I contacted him via abgeordnetenwatch.de and sent him the studies via e-mail but he never answered, therefore it is unknown on which information he based his claim. However, numerous studies prove that renewable energies are technically capable of covering 100% of Germany’s energy demand. In reality, there are also considerations on how the energy needs can be covered in the most efficient way. The most realistic solution is a combination of domestic energy production through solar and wind power and imports from abroad. Therefore, the statement that Germany will never fulfill its energy requirements with only wind energy and solar power, is false.

EU climate politics = expensive energy/high prices.” The billboards turned out to be part of a campaign ran by Polish state-owned utility companies, financed by the Polish Ministry of State Assets. The claim on the billboards turns out to be true but is rather misleading. The state-owned utility company called Towarzystwo Gospodarcze Polskie Elektrownie (TGPE) was responsible for coordinating the campaign all over Poland with support from the government. The claim on the billboards saying that 60% of the energy production costs consists of EU climate tax is true, but it can easily be misinterpreted by the target audience: consumers of electricity and other types of energy.   The company published a statement on their website where it explains how it had calculated the percentage. First, the emission costs per ton of CO2 are multiplied by the so-called emission factor. The outcoming is then divided by the average market price of electricity in 2022. When the two are added up, this provides the reader with the percentage found on the billboards: 59% (rounded up to 60%). The price of emission rights turns out to be correct and so does the price of electricity according to the European Emission Authority and the Polish government. Therefore, the calculations can be deemed as correct, but is misleading.   Polish think tank Forum Energii also states in one of their recent publications that the figure is correct, but also misleading to consumers of energy. The statement creates the impression that 60% of the consumer’s energy bill consists of emission rights. Therefore, not paying these emission rights would result in a 60% decrease of the energy bill. However, in addition to the cost of production there is also the cost of distribution, capacity, transition, value added tax, and more. With that in mind, only 23% of the consumer’s energy bill consists of emission right costs. Moreover, while the figure stated on the billboards is true, Poland generates the majority of its energy with fossil fuels resulting in pricey emission rights.   Conclusion The claim that “The European Union’s climate tax is as much as 60% of energy production costs”, is true. The calculations of the TGPE were done correctly with the data provided. However, the goal of the statement found on the billboards appears to convince the consumer that they’re paying huge amounts (60%), while only 23% of their total energy bill consists of emission rights according to the experts at Forum Energii.

On the other hand, enforcing the law in practice would be very problematic and rather unrealistic.This claim could get classified as largely false, as there are many arguments against it. Figure 1: Claim and Caption of the Article from Russia Today. Retrieved on 3 March 2022. Source  The author of the article, Maria Müller, cites the Ukrainian law “About procedure for the admission and conditions of stay of divisions of armed forces of other states in the territory of Ukraine” as the source for this claim. It was first adopted in 2000 and reformed in 2015. Valentina Nikitina, a journalism master student from Kiev who has also completed a Bachelor’s degree in law, helped to translate this law into English. The law’s primarily version of Article 4, paragraph 2 from 2000 stated: “Potential carriers of nuclear weapons and other types of mass destruction are allowed in accordance with the international agreement of Ukraine for short-term deployment on the territory of Ukraine, subject to proper reconstruction, as evidenced by the relevant document.“The primarily version of Article 4, paragraph 2 in Ukrainian from 2000  Since the law’s reform in 2015, it is also necessary to ensure that Ukraine is responsible for adequately controlling nuclear weapons that may be stationed on Ukrainian territory for a short period of time. “Potential carriers of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction are permitted under the international agreement of Ukraine to be stationed on the territory of Ukraine for a short period of time, provided that Ukraine ensures proper control over their presence on the territory of Ukraine.”The reformed version of Article 4, paragraph 2 in Ukrainian from 2015  Referring to the mentioned law excerpt, it can be said that a part of the claim – that it’s possible by law for third countries to deploy nuclear weapons on Ukrainian ground (since 2015) – is true. But is “the danger really real”? As further research shows, enforcing the law in practice would be very problematic and rather unrealistic. Ukraine has not had its own nuclear weapons since 1994 To understand the background of the law, however, it is important to look into the past. According to Dr. Alexander Graef from the “Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy” at the University of Hamburg, an expert on Russian foreign and military policy, it is true and well known that after the collapse of the USSR in 1990, Ukraine possessed nuclear weapons as a sovereign state from 1991 to 1994. These were still from the time of the USSR. The crucial point, however, is that although nuclear weapons were in Ukraine’s possession, Ukraine never had control over them, as Dr. Alexander Graef confirms. Ukraine signed the “Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances” In 1994 Ukraine signed the “Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances”. It states that Russia, the United States and Great Britain pledge sovereignty to Ukraine and its independency, if it renounces the possession of nuclear weapons. But another contradiction took place, as there were different versions of the memorandum in the different languages. Valentina Nikita listed this as another argument. While the English translation of the Budapest Memorandum speaks of “security insurances”, the Ukrainian translation says “security guarantees”. In a 2009 article, Ukrainian diplomat Volodymyr Vasylenko described the situation from the Ukrainian perspective as follows: “Therefore, the form and content of the Memorandum (…) show that, unfortunately, the Budapest talks on giving Ukraine security guarantees did not eventually result in a comprehensive international agreement that creates an adequate special international mechanism to protect our national security. Tellingly, the authentic English-language copies of the Memorandum use the term “security assurances” which is far weaker than “security guarantees.” (…)”Ukrainian diplomat Volodymyr Vasylenko Over the course of time, the Budapest Memorandum came under increasing criticism in Ukraine. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was a massive violation of the provisions of the Budapest Memorandum. To this day, Russia violates the agreements of the Budapest Memorandum on a daily basis. The attack on the whole of Ukraine in February 2022 can be seen as the culmination of the violation. Nevertheless, Ukraine has not violated any of the agreements to date.   Ukraine has signed treaties against the usage of nuclear weapons By accepting the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine also joined the “Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons” (NPT): “The NPT is a landmark international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament.”Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Specifically, this means that Ukraine (as well as further 191 states that have signed the treaty) may not proliferate and use nuclear weapons. Moreover, Ukraine has also signed other treaties and international laws on nuclear energy, as Valentina Nikitina argued. It is strategically impossible for third countries to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine According to Dr. Alexander Graef, outside of Russia there are no (mobile) land-based delivery systems in Europe but only submarines, ships and planes. This includes strategic weapon systems of Great Britain and France, but also sub-strategic free-fall bombs of the USA which are part of NATO’s nuclear sharing. These are stationed in the NATO member states Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey. Figure 4: US Nuclear Weapons in Europe. Retrieved on 12 April 2022. Source: FAS. According to Dr. Alexander Graef, a delivery of these weapons to Ukraine is technically possible if appropriate agreements were made. However, from a political and military point of view, it is impossible to deliver these nuclear weapons into the Ukraine. Especially because Ukraine is not a NATO member and there would be very big security concerns. Bringing these weapons into Ukraine is out of the question and would also be militarily futile.  Russia Today’s lack of neutrality It is well known that Russia Today, where the article got published, is funded by the public household of the Russian Federation. Since 2 March, 2022, the website and TV-channel of RT is banned in Europe “to conduct disinformation and information manipulation actions against the Eu and its member states”. Although the above claim was supported by a reputable source, other approaches and accounts quoted in the article were taken out of context and there is no evidence to support or reflect them in this way. Another claim the author made, was that Ukraine had reformed the given law in order to station nuclear weapons in the immediate vicinity of the Russian border. This could not be substantiated with any other source. The described danger for Russia is also not accurate after examining the sources. It appears that only a “pro-Russian” view was presented in the article. Conclusion Even through the given law excerpt, it can be proven that a part of the claim – that it’s possible by law for third countries to deploy nuclear weapons on Ukrainian ground (since 2015) – is true. However, in view of international laws and agreements signed by Ukraine and other countries, an implementation of this law is almost impossible in practice. That means the danger is not real and the claim is mostly false.

16;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-belgium-drops-to-the-49th-place-in-the-climate-change-performance-index/;“Belgium drops to the 49th place in the Climate Change Performance Index”;2022-04-26;eufactcheck;;On November 9, 2021, Flemish newspaper “De Morgen” published an article titled “Belgium loses more terrain on climate index: 49th place between Belarus and Slovenia.” Does Belgium really perform that bad in the Climate Change Performance Index compared to other European countries? Yes, it does. What is the CCPI? The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) is a monitoring tool for looking at the climate protection performance of countries. The CCPI measures the efforts made by 60 countries and the European Union on how they try to preserve the climate. These countries collectively are responsible for 92% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. The results are being evaluated by 400 experts of the respective countries. How is the CCPI calculated? The Climate Change Performance is calculated using 80% quantitative data from internationally recognized institutions, the other 20% is based on the CCPI’s unique climate policy section. This data gets transferred into four categories and fourteen sub-categories. The four categories are global greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy. This way the Climate Change Performance delivers a comprehensive and balanced evaluation of the countries that are being compared. Why does Belgium perform so bad? Belgium dropped 9 places in the ranking to become 49th on the Climate Change Performance Index, they just perform better than countries like Poland who still mine for lignite (a very harmful, non-reusable coal, used as fuel source) and Hungary who are not following the terms that are being set by the European Union. Belgium performs worse than the likes of China (place 38), one of the biggest industrial countries in the world. Belgium is also miles away from their neighboring countries France, the Netherlands and Germany, who are in the top 20.  Belgium’s results on the CCPI But why does Belgium perform so bad according to the climate change performance index? In all of the categories Belgium performs very bad. In the categories GHG emissions, renewable energy and climate policy, Belgium received a low score. In the category energy use Belgium got a very low score, in this category Belgium dropped 13 places thus they are in the lowest 10 in this category. The spokesperson of WWF Belgium is very strict for Belgium. “Only in 2020 the emissions of Belgium dropped due to the corona lockdowns. We now see that there is no further drop in emissions. There need to be structural changes to perform better, but if we watch our neighboring countries, our climate policy is seriously underdeveloped.”  The government of Belgium made a few new rules to suppress the further downfall and to perform better on the CCPI, but Belgium’s overall climate ambition is being held back. The European Union endorsed Belgium to perform better and to make a plan to improve Belgium’s climate action. The European Commission thought the plan was not good enough and said the ambition of Belgium’s plan lack reforms towards a better climate policy. According to WWF Belgium this is indeed true. “Belgium performs a lot worse than neighboring countries and is a lot less ambitious. One of the biggest examples is the wish to become climate neutral. Germany wants to be climate neutral in 2045 while Belgium only wants to drop emissions with 45%.” Improvements Experts of the Climate Change Performance Index note some signs of improvement in Belgium’s transport sector. With more investments in public transport and projects to improve offshore wind power. WWF Belgium confirms this. “Belgium has promised to build a windmill park in the North Sea. This way Belgium will produce three times as much power as they produce today. We will also buy more green power from Denmark.” This would mean Belgium would get a better score on the Climate Change Performance Index since they perform the worst in the energy categories. Even though there seem to be possible changes in the future the experts are concerned that concrete political changes will be made since they have been lacking so far. This is also reflected in the low rating Belgium has in the Climate Policy category.  Conclusion The claim that Belgium performs bad in the CCPI is true. The Climate Change Performance Index is a respected benchmark when it comes to the performance of climate change control of countries. Bond Beter Leefmilieu, Greenpeace, Inter-Environment Wallonie & WWF all respect the CCPI and express their concerns to the poor performance of Belgium on the Climate Change Performance Index.

It is also stated that 28% of the Bulgarian population does not have a bank account and the number of ATMs is 94 (per 100,000 people). Our team decided to research these claims further. In the article, published on April 4, 2022 on Novinite.com, it is stated that “63% of Transactions in Bulgaria are made in Cash”. The claim is factual, quantitative and it has a clearly defined subject: the transactions in Bulgaria. It can also be characterized as precise, having the exact percentage of the claim in mind. While the headline highlights the cash transactions in Bulgaria, the article contains information about other European countries, such as: Romania, The Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Greece. The time period over which the research took place is not specifically mentioned in the article. The name of the PR firm “M3 Communications Group” appears at the end of the article, no author is mentioned. The claim is based on statistics from Global Findex. The claim author is the World Bank and its Global Findex database – the biggest global source of information on how adults from different countries manage their finances. Since Global Findex is part of The World Bank, the claim author capacity can be classified as a leading field expert. The claim source is the Global Findex in particular. Our team found these statements in an article from Novinite.com, but then we came across other online media that published the same information in an approximate time period.  Multiple Articles Covering the Subject “Bulgaria ranks second in Europe in cash payments” is the title of the article published this year by Pariteni.bg on April 1st at 6:14 p.m. (with no author mentioned). The article states that 63% of the payments made in Bulgaria are in cash and that 28% of the population doesn’t have any bank accounts. The digital media clarifies that the claims are based on a statistic from Global Findex, quoted by Euronet. DarikNews.bg published an article (in Bulgarian) titled “Survey: Bulgaria ranks second in Europe in cash payments” on the 1st of April, 2022 at 1:12 p.m. It is also noted that 28% of Bulgarians do not have a bank account, as stated in the article from Novinite.com. DarikNews wrote that “Bulgaria is second in Europe after Romania in terms of cash payments, according to data from Global Findex, quoted by Euronet” but then pointed out the Bulgarian News Agency as their source. Pariteni.bg and DarikNews.bg are part of Netinfo’s portfolio and so is Nova.bg – a leader in the Bulgarian news distribution market and considered a reliable source of information in the country, with over 1 872 000 users (for January, 2022) according to Gemius Bulgaria, cited by Netinfo. We checked Nova.bg but there was no article that included these claims. We proceeded to the Bulgarian News Agency website and discovered something quite interesting. To begin with, they did publish an article titled “Bulgaria Has Europe’s Second-Largest Share of Cash Payments” in which the author, Valentin Evstatiev, writes about cash payments being 63% in Bulgaria and a total of 28% of Bulgarians lacking a bank account. This year, on April 6th, at 9:45 a.m., the article was published online. It’s interesting how DarikNews.bg cites the Bulgarian News Agency even though the DarikNews article was published earlier. There are more examples and one of them is econ.bg which repeats all three statements (the percentage of the cash payments, the percentage of the population with no bank account and the number of ATMs in Bulgaria) from novinite.com but in Bulgarian. Econ.bg published an article on April, 1st, 2022 at 4:55 p.m. with the headline – “63% of transactions in Bulgaria are made in cash”. It is indicated that the team of econ.bg has worked on the article but there are no specific names mentioned. In the footer of the website we noticed that econ.bg is also a part of the portfolio of NoviniteGroup.com,  just like Novinite.com.  Money.bg, TechNews.bg and Novini247.com also write about the topic. These online media outlets repeat all three statements, claimed in the article that our team is fact-checking. Novini247.com (published on the 1st of April, 2022 at 4:02 p.m.) points econ.bg as its source while Money.bg (published on the 1st of April, 2022 at 5:20 p.m.) and TechNews.bg (published on the 1st of April, 2022 at 5:23 p.m.) indicate that their own teams have worked on the article.  The Cited Source Provides No Information About Cash Transactions in Bulgaria The article claims the data was taken from Global Findex, which is a report that measures global progress toward financial inclusion and collates data obtained from national representative surveys. The database has been published every three years since 2011 but there has not been an official report for 2020, therefore the last information that can be accessed is from 2017. In September, 2021 the World Bank announced that it would discontinue its flagship “Doing Business” report due to internally reported data irregularities on “Doing Business” 2018 and 2020. Our team could not confirm if the suspension of the Global Findex report is related to that or if the Global Findex database has faced similar issues. The article claims that the percentage of the population without a bank account is 28% and from the Global Findex database from 2017 we can see that information was true for 2017. In the report Bulgaria is mentioned 4 times but in terms of a gender gap in account ownership, adults receiving public sector wages and details of survey methodology, however there is no information about cash transactions and number of ATMs.  Image 1. A screenshot of the Indicator table – Account ownership, 2017 from the Global Findex report for 2017 According to the Bulgarian National Bank the number of ATMs per 100 000 population in 2021 is 77 While conducting research through the World Bank data, we found the Little Data Book on Financial Inclusion 2018, which is a pocket edition of the Global Findex database published in 2018. The report shows the percentage of the digital payments made with a debit or credit card but there is no information about cash transactions. When trying to find information from The European Central Bank, we found their “Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area” which unfortunately doesn’t include Bulgaria. We tried to find official statistics from BNB (Bulgarian National Bank) but all we could find was the number of ATMs. According to the information provided by BNB and NSI (National Statistical Institute), the number of ATMs per 100 000 population for the year 2021 is 77 and for the year 2017 it is 81 which doesn’t match with the information given in the article – “Number of ATMs per 100,000 population: 94”. Conclusion In short,  according to the Global Findex Database 28% of Bulgarians didn’t have a bank account in 2017. We couldn’t verify if this information is still relevant in 2022, at the time of publication. The Global Findex Database from 2017 contains no information about the cash transactions and number of ATMs in Bulgaria. According to information, provided by the Bulgarian National Bank, the number of ATMs per 100 000 population for the year 2021 is 77 and in 2017: it was 81. The number stated in the article, published by Novinite.com, is 94, that part of the claim is false. The publication time can be tracked down to Euronet, that is mentioned in at least two other articles published in the first week of April, 2022 using the same data. Euronet is represented by the PR firm M3 Communications mentioned in the article. After thorough research, we’ve found the claim that Bulgaria is the second most cash-reliant country in Europe to be uncheckable. At the time of publication of this article there were no recent surveys that could support it.

18;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-drastic-increase-in-suicide-attempts-by-children/;“Drastic increase in suicide attempts by children“;2022-04-26;eufactcheck;;According to an article published by Berliner Morgenpost on January 6, a study of the Essen University Hospital claims that up to 500 children required treatment in intensive care units in Germany after suicide attempts. Since it is not possible to verify this statement, this claim must be classified as uncheckable. „Lockdown-study. Corona: Drastic increase in suicide attempts by children“ publishes in the German Newspaper Berliner Morgenpost. The article explains that the lockdown due to coronavirus could be a possible cause. There was a strict lockdown in Germany between november 2020 and may 2021. Many children and teenagers weren’t able to meet their friends and could not pursue their hobbies since sport clubs, swimming pools and gyms were closed. Also, stores except supermarkets were closed and schools were open or closed again and again. Unfortunately, it wasn’t possible to get access to the primary source. According to Dr. Christian Dohna-Schwake, who participated in the study, it isn’t published yet. Nevertheless, according to the German Federal office of statistics there was a small increase in suicide rates from 2019 to 2020. But as you can see in figure 1, overall, the trend has been declining since 2015. Unfortunately, the numbers for 2021 are not out yet. Figure 1: Deaths from intentional self-harm in Germany. Source: destatis Statistical recording of suicide attempts Ute Lewitzka, a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy from the German Society for Suicide Prevention, pointed out that suicide attempts are not recorded in a statistically valid way at all. Dr. Lewitzka explained that it is possible that there are regional clusters, but this is difficult to generalize and not possible to verify. She also stated that there are estimated 10–20 suicide attempts for one suicide case. The psychological effects of the lockdown However, there are several studies that explain that the lockdown has had a negative effect on the psyche of children and teenagers. According to a study by the german federal institute for population research, the number of teenagers between the ages 16 to 19 who show clinically relevant symptoms of depression has more than doubled after the first lockdown in 2020. The depressiveness score of female teenagers has even tripled, from 13 to 35 percent (see figure 2). Helena Ludwig- Walz, who works at the institute, explains that isolation and loneliness in particular are very stressful especially for children and can lead to psychological problems. Figure 2: Occurrence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms at 16 to 19 year olds before and at the end of the first lockdown. Source:BIB The COPSY study by the university hospital Hamburg also shows that the pandemic reduced the mental well-being of children and adolescents and increased the risk for mental disorders. In the study, children and teenagers from the age 11 to 17 were interviewed and also parents were interviewed about their 7- to 10-year-old children. According to the study, psychosomatic complaints as stomachache, feeling low, headache, sleeping problems and irritability increased with each wave of infection and the associated lockdown (see figure 3). It is also stated in the study that 71 percent of the interviewed children and teenagers felt burdened by the contact restrictions, in the second wave it was already 83 percent. Figure 3: Psychosomatic complaints at least once per week measured prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (BELLA study), in wave 1 and in wave 2 of the COPSY study. Source: COPSY Therapy requests increased According to a survey from the German Psychotherapists Association, the number of therapy requests  increased from 2020 to 2021. 60 percent more children and adolescents than in the previous year requested a therapy place. “Corona will leave its mark on the next generation. […] We need a support program for mental health and social interaction” explains German Psychotherapists Association Federal chairman Gebhard Hentschel. Youth suicide deaths in Spain In Spain, suicide is the second external cause of youth death just after traffic accidents, according to the study CrecerSaludable(mente). This report was made by the NGO Save the Children to analyse the impact of the pandemic in terms of mental health. According to the data available in the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE), there were 314 deaths by suicide in 2020 in young people under the age of 30. The number is more or less the same as the year 2019 when 316 young people took their own life. There is still no data for the year 2021, which is expected to be released in October 2022. In the following graphic, we see the evolution of youth suicide during the past decade in Spain and how it has been relatively stable. It must be taken into account that the data provided by the Spanish authorities rely on death-certificates information on the cause of death. According to Pere Taberner, one of the authors of the study previously mentioned, that could give a low estimate of the real number, especially in children under 15, where official deaths are relatively low.  However, it is true that 2020 has been the year with more suicides in the past decade if we consider all age groups. In the year when the pandemic started, 3941 Spanish people took their own life. The average between 2011 and 2020 was 3650 deaths. This increase does not apply to young people. In the following graphic, we see the percentage of suicide of youth under the age of 30 in relation to the total number of all age groups.  We have focused so far on deaths, but suicide attempts are also relevant when talking about mental health and the pandemic. INE stopped publishing data about attempts in 2007. The reason given was to „follow international standards on the subject”. Before that year the institute developed a specific study on suicide with information about attempts and methods. After 2007, suicide was included in the death cause report and the only information given is now the deaths by gender and age group. However, the report CrecerSaludable(mente) includes data from the Teléfono de la Esperanza the Spanish suicide prevention hotline. During 2020, they attended 160.646 calls, 38 percent more than the previous year. Around 8.000 of them were cases of people under the age of 25. Conclusion There is no denying that the lockdown has led to increased psychological distress in children and teens. However, because there was no insight into the primary source and none of the experts could confirm the statement, it is classified as uncheckable. In addition, it must be said that psychological stress does not necessarily lead to suicide. If you are not in your best moment and have recently experienced suicidal thoughts, remember that you are not alone. There is help available for you. In case of an emergency, in Spain, you can call 112 or Teléfono de la Esperanza (717 00 37 17). In Germany, you can call the Telefonseelsorge (0800/111 0 111). If you live elsewhere in the world, you can find your national hotline here. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

The author Ashutosh Pandey (Senior Business Editor for DW) states that China is a dominating force in the graphite supply chain, bearing in mind that the material is used in lithium-ion batteries, needed for the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs). Therefore, causing concern as to how that will affect the global market for EVs, given that world governments are pushing for reduction of carbon emissions. The claims Pandey makes turn out to be true. China: The graphite powerhouse The article contains a couple of claims, aimed at supporting the main idea of Chinese dominance on the market. We have also found pieces of information originating from a secondary source Fastmarkets’s articles, published in January 2022. One of the first claims that were checked concerns the potential shortage in graphite supply. Through an additional source we have confirmed that transitioning to electric vehicles has made the demand for graphite very large, as it is a main element in lithium-ion batteries needed for electric vehicles. We have also researched the cost of Chinese graphite, which depends on the mixture of both natural and synthetic graphite used in the anodes produces. Manufacturers favor synthetic graphite due to its higher purity and controlled specifications. It offers a longer lifespan and a faster charge turnaround. Synthetic graphite however, costs more and consumes more energy. As to natural graphite mining in China, it has been historically called out for environmental regulations and discharging dust pollutants. Based on this information we can conclude that if any factor (production cost; carbon dioxide emission reduction laws) were to disrupt the production chain, a global shortage of graphite will inevitably be felt worldwide. All throughout the article makes multiple points, containing evidence for China’s leading position in graphite trade. We have chosen multiple other resources in support of that claim. The chart in Image 1, sourced from Comtrade clearly showcases the difference in numbers between countries, providing proof for China’s leadership in the export of materials like graphite, needed for the manufacturing of car batteries.  Image 1. Screenshot of a chart, demonstrating China’s leading position in EV battery materials export in 2020 Having established that China is truly a leading force in graphite export, the focus will now shift to analyzing if this will threaten EV manufacturing worldwide. We have also found an additional research paper further establishing that by 2021 China was still the global leader in producing graphite with 79% of the total world output, according the US Geological Survey in January. Taking a closer look at Europe’s market, we can confirm that effort is put into becoming a bigger producer. In the DW article, a claim is made that the number of EVs expected to be put in use by the next decade will rise, as part of a global zero carbon pledges. This information is based on a resource from BloombergsNEF’s. After conducted research, we have found multiple such pledges in existence (year 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060). The one mentioned in the DW article is from 2030 and it may be possible that it is based on a secondary source from BloombergNEF. Europe’s efforts for going green As we have made point of how China will affect the global market, we have decided to do additional research about the European market conditions for EVs. The original article mentions briefly that Europe is prompted to speed up the efforts to find a different source than China in order to shorten the supply chain. We have found proof supporting that claim. The European Commission has approved €2.9 billion in subsidies for EU members in order to stimulate European-based production of batteries for electric vehicles. With Europe currently accounting for only 3% of world battery cell production. The final goal being a lowered reliance on Asian materials. When envisioning Europe’s future battery industry, further efforts are made to develop the European Battery Alliance, which launched in 2017 with the goal of making Europe a global leader in sustainable battery production and use. Another vital part of this alliance is the European Green Deal, which targets carbon emissions reduction by 2050. Conclusion We have established the claim that China dominates the global graphite market to be true. According to the evidence displayed, we are inclined to agree with the information included in the Deutsche Welle article. As for whether China poses a threat to electric car ambitions, we conclude that given the country’s big market share it is possible to affect the supply chain in a negative way, contributing to a shortfall of the material.

Even though the numbers of psychotherapies of children and adolescents are rising rapidly right now, it is not possible to verify this fact clearly. Therefore this claim must be classified as uncheckable. „Mental Imbalance Youth: The hurt of Generation Z. Generation Z suffers more from mental health problems than any other generation before, but it also paves the way for a new way of dealing with it. An excerpt from the Health Report 2022 by Corinna Mühlhausen.” Source: Zukunftsinstitut The European refugee crisis of 2015/16, the Covid pandemic and last but not least the Ukraine war have had a massive impact on mental stress. Members of Generation Z (i.e. children and young people born between 1997 and 2012) are particularly affected. According to the DAK’s (German health-insurance company) Children and Adolescents Report from 2019, that focused on depression and anxiety in school-aged children, 27% of children and adolescents in Germany suffer from psychological issues and have been treated medically at least once. In general, there has been an increase in psychotherapies in German health insurance companies, as the DAK mental report 2019 shows. While numbers in Germany steadily rise, the pooled overall prevalence of 17.6% for emotional and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents in Germany lies within the range reported in international reviews, confirms the HBSC longitudinal cross-national study. However, this trend is not limited to young people, but can also be seen in adults. For example, from 1997 to 2019, the number of days of absence due to mental illness inGermany increased by 239 percent and mental problems are the number one reason for missing work. In Germany, 9.7% of the adult population report at least one contact with psycho-therapeutic or psychiatric care providers within one year, according to a study by the Robert Koch Institut. Depression as highest diagnosis The problems that seem to be the most occurring in children as well as adults are depression and anxiety disorders. The WHO estimates that approximately 280 million people, which makes about 5% of adults worldwide, suffer from depression. Overall in the course of a year, 8.2%, or 5.3 million, of adult Germans (18-79 years) have a unipolar or persistent depressive disorder, estimates the Deutsche Depressionshilfe. However, it is difficult to determine an exact number of depression cases for children and adolescents, says doctor and research psychologist Claus Barkmann at the UKE Hamburg. „Just because the results of research shows increasing mental health issues, doesn’t mean that children are really affected because of a certain diagnosis […] many side effects and symptoms won’t be considered, as an example of symptom shifting. Depression in children shows completely different symptoms than in adults”. The Covid-19 pandemic has also impacted the mental health of children and adolescents. Cases and treatments have risen extremely, which makes it hard to make an adequate statement”, confirms Jona Stahmeyer, head of staff at the AOK (German health insurance company). Trauma transmission by parents Another contributing factor to the mental health of children and adolescents are their parents and/or legal guardians. What has been found out though, is that young people with parents who suffer from mental health problems are more likely to also suffer from them as well. The Children and Adolescents Report from 2019 by the DAK confirms that 33.6% of all DAK-insured children also have a parent who has received medical treatment at least once for mental health problems in 2017. That number is about 10% higher than for children without a mentally ill parent. Up to late adolescence, the observed risk for a mental illness in childhood is up to 80 % higher if one parent is mentally ill himself/herself, states the report. Doctor Claus Barkmann also confirms these findings: „The transgenerational transmission of trauma is quite possible. For example, children can inherit their parents’ trauma and then might encounter problems themselves.” Jona Stahmeyer explains the other side: „If mental health is talked about openly in the family, then the topic becomes less taboo with the children, and this rubs off”, which could explain the rise in psychotherapies being taken up. Inconsistencies in various studies Many studies confirm an increase in mental illnesses over the years, however, not all studies show the same results. The KIGGs longitudinal study shows that there is a downward trend in the number of mentally disturbed children and adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. Whereas 20% of children showed signs of mental illnesses, eleven years later it was only 16,9%. Jona Stahmeyer explains that a comparison of different studies is rather impossible, because of different data, guidelines and policies. Claus Barkmann also adds that every study uses different techniques and samples and can therefore not be adequately compared to one another. „There is a perception bias in research, as it is very popular to publish that children are mentally ill and less the other way around”, says Barkmann. This further shows the inconsistency in the research market. Comparison of generations To check the claim we have to look at the childhood and adolescents of the now adults. This seems to be impossible, as there is no available data to be found. The oldest studies accessible are from the 1980s and 1990s, which covers the childhood of Generation Y, but generations beforehand are left without data. „The health insurance funds are subject to a statutory deletion period of 7-8 years for patient data. Information before that, except for a few statistics, therefore no longer exists”, explains Jona Stahmeyer. Doctor Barkmann further elaborates that the definition, criteria and reputation of mental illnesses was so different compared to now, that problems were not treated or even talked about. „It is impossible to find good long term research about mental health, because the criteria for depression and anxiety changes constantly, every study also uses different variables and tools. So there is no possibility to compare the results of different years”, says Barkmann. He further elaborates that Generation Z is observed more than any generation before it in the area of mental health. This leads to the effect that it appears as if it is also the most mentallyaffected, but that’s not the truth with regard to the previous generations. Conclusion In short, the different researches can not be compared adequately. The lack of data for previous generations further proves that a comparison is impossible. This is why the claim by Mühlhausen has to be rated as uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

After loosing its parliamentary majority in July 2021, the Moldovan Socialist Party claimed that the new government’s measures led to a near 60% reduction in vaccination rates in Moldova. The claim turns out to be mostly false. In Moldova, the pro-European “Action and Solidarity” (PAS) party won a parliamentary majority in the July 2021 elections. The new government was officially inaugurated on the 6th of August, having Natalia Gavriliță as a prime minister. Before that, the Socialists and Democrats had the parliamentary majority in Moldova. The Socialists blame the pro-European PAS party for the vaccination decrease Almost two months after the inauguration of the new prime minister, the left-wing Moldovan Socialist Party publishes a news item. The news article claims that Moldova’s vaccination rate has decreased by almost 60% as a result of the new government’s actions. The socialists state that between July 6 and August 5, 335,044 people got vaccinated in Moldova, compared to 148,690 people that have been immunized with the vaccine from August 6 until September 5. But did the vaccination rate drop by almost 60% during those weeks? And if so, was the new government to blame for the decrease? According to the daily vaccination reports, requested from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Moldova, between July 6 and August 5, 335,054 people got vaccinated, a number very similar to the one given by the socialists. But the alleged drop by “almost 60 %” turns out to be slight exaggeration. The reports from the Ministry of Health show that from August 6 to September 5, 342 824 people have been vaccinated, meaning that the vaccination rate decreased by 56%, instead of 60%. The new government is not responsible for the vaccination decrease While the Socialists blame the new government for the drop in vaccinations, the “Action and Solidarity” party can hardly be held responsible for the temporary decrease of the vaccination rate. According to Ala Tocarciuc, independent consultant and expert in public health, the drop in the vaccination rate was influenced by multiple factors: “I do not think that the change of the political structure in the Parliament has a direct impact on the dynamics of the vaccination campaign. The access to the vaccine and the presence of fake news – all together fueled the reluctance of the vaccination”. Conclusion The claim “Due to the new government’s measures, Moldova’s vaccination rate decreased by 60%” is mostly false. According to the daily reports of the Ministry of Health, the vaccination rate in the country dropped by 56%, not 60%. Moreover, the second part of the statement is not correct either, as short-term changes in the vaccination rate cannot be directly attributed to a change in the government.

22;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-teachers-salaries-in-germany-are-higher-than-the-national-average/;“Teachers’ salaries in Germany are higher than the national average”;2022-02-17;eufactcheck;;On September 1, 2021,  “Deutsche Welle” published an article titled “How much do school teachers earn in Germany and can they be granted gifts?” Its author, Xenia Safronova, a journalist, claims that German teachers are paid 3 to 5 thousand euro per month on average, and this meets the benchmark of «higher than average» in Germany.  We claim that brutto / netto terms haven’t been fully explained in the article. The difference between these two is crucial and it certainly affects the way the information is perceived.  «Netto» is money that an employee receives on-hand. Brutto salary is also called “gross pay” and “paycheck” in the vernacular. As a matter of fact, workers receive less than what they actually earn. «Brutto / Netto salary margin may be as high as 30 percent depending on the region», – that’s what our expert, Anna Abrosimova, Associate Professor of the Lobachevsky University’s Institute of Economics and Entrepreneurship, claims. We also paid attention to the fact that when mentioning 3 to 5 thousand euro salary, Deutsche Welle refers to their own article of 2019, “How much do teachers earn in Germany?”, and its author, Tatiana Weinman, relies on the statistics for 2017 provided by OECD. In general, this data is still relevant to this day, but that doesn’t concern all the teachers in Germany. The thing is that most of the municipal school employees are civil servants. That means their wage level is regulated by the legislation in accordance with which certain ranks of teachers can receive a higher salary. However, it is important to notice that the number of civil service teachers much depends on federal states. Civil service teachers’ salaries are divided into multiple categories. This information is confirmed by our expert, a German teacher. Our expert decided to remain incognito. We have the right to not disclose the source as this goes in accordance with the rules of the German Press Code.  «Speaking of the wage level, it’s important to consider the academic background. Getting hired at school after gymnasium you get A13 status. After that, you can be promoted to Senior Tutor, who receives a salary of A14 level. The next level is A15 and that includes the educational institution’s supervising staff, members of school administration. Principal belongs to A16 category, vice-principals belong to A15 with bonus payments». The tables below show the approximate salaries of teachers of different categories, as well as the time for which they can reach the next one. In the state Saarland, for example, a teacher on A13 level will begin with 4179,79 euro (see first table). With experience, his salary will increase over time up to a maximum of 5380,91 euro if he does not get promoted to a higher level. Salary groups A4 through A16 for civil servants in the state Saarland valid from April 1st, 2021 – Source: dbb beamtenbund und tarifunion (The German Civil Service Association and Tariff Union) Salary groups A4 through A16 for civil servants in Sachsen-Anhalt valid from January 1st, 2021 – Source: dbb beamtenbund und tarifunion (The German Civil Service Association and Tariff Union) Salary groups A4 through A16 for civil servants in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern valid from January 1st, 2021 – Source: dbb beamtenbund und tarifunion (The German Civil Service Association and Tariff Union) Salary groups A4 through A16 for civil servants in Hamburg valid from January 1st, 2021 – Source: dbb beamtenbund und tarif union (The German Civil Service Association and tariff Uniion) Overall, we agree with Ms. Safronova’s claim about teachers getting paid 3 to 5 thousand euro brutto per month but it is important to mention the fact that we only take civil service teachers into account. We are also going to insist on the issue of the “brutto salary” a term not being fully explained.  This article also states that teachers’ salaries meet the benchmark of «higher than average» in Germany. According to data provided by The Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) that the author of the article refers to, the median wage of 2020 in Germany is 3,975 euro. As mentioned previously, the minimum wage for teachers equates with A12-A13 levels. Therefore, we have the following minimum wage in different federal states:  According to the information taken from a publicly available source Destatis, educational workers received 57,432 euro in 2020. This is indeed the average figure as teachers who have bigger experience and the status of civil servant received more and teachers of lower status received less, respectively. Nonetheless, it does not contradict the information from Deutsche Welle. As for the median wage for all the sectors, it amounted to 53,000 euro per year if we are to calculate the arithmetic mean using the available data. As a result, the information about teachers’ salaries being higher than the median wage countrywide provided by Deutsche Welle also holds true. However it is important to notice that it is higher than the median wage by 4 thousand euro a year (that is approximately by 333 euro a month).  Conclusion Despite us having the opinion that the difference between brutto and netto salaries hasn’t been clearly explained in the article and disagreeing with a categorical statement made by Ms. Safronova that teachers’ salaries fall under the category of «higher than average», we have to admit that the statistical information presented in the article is genuine and that is confirmed by both our experts. Therefore, we consider that this material by Deutsche Welle can be classified as “mostly true”.

A video posted on TikTok claims that the Italians protested against the green passports and stormed the mall. The green passports came into force in Georgia from December 1, 2020. Fully vaccinated individuals, individuals recovered from COVID-19 and those with negative rapid and PCR test certificate conducted within the last 24 and 72 hours respectively can comply with the “green status”. Without this status Georgian citizen cannot enter hotels, food facilities, cinemas, theatres, concert halls, entertainment centres, spa, and centres, etc. This policy was followed by protest in individuals with anti-vax sentiments, as well as disinformation on social media platforms.  According to the author of the video, the video was shot in October 2021 and depicts the protest of the population against green passports. The video shows footage of several hundred people entering an unknown facility. The author of the video does not specify in which city the footage was taken.  In the comments of TikTok, one of the users questioned the authenticity of the video and paid attention to the clothes of the people participating in the video. According to his comment, people in Italy would not wear summer clothes in November. The author of the fake video replied that green passports were introduced in Italy in October, at a time when it was hot. In the comments, the author of the video claims that green passports were approved in Italy in October when it was hot in Italy. With this, the author tries to explain the inconsistency of the season and the clothes of the people participating in the video.  Using search terms we also found a suspicious account on Twitter that shared the same video with an identical description. The video was posted on November 5 and has 434 retweets and 816 likes as of December 1.  We analyzed the Twitter video in In VID. Reverse Image Search of the keyframes revealed that the video was shot in Italy, Rome, in 2011, long before the Coronavirus pandemic began. This video is searched on the YouTube channel of the online football editorial In de Hekken. The video actually shows football club Napoli supporters coming to the Olimpico Stadium to watch a football match.  The video is searched on YouTube from 2011 and shows Napoli supporters. Conclusion In conclusion, the video circulating on TikTok is false. The author tried to discredit the policy of green passports in Georgia by demonstrating that the same policy was met by mass protest and storming of the building in European country as well. In fact, the video appears to be much older than COVID-19 and depicts football fans.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Goga Nizharadze Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

24;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-postal-voting-is-a-big-problem-and-electoral-fraud-is-a-sad-truth-in-germany/;“Postal voting is a big problem and electoral fraud is a sad truth in Germany”;2022-02-14;eufactcheck;;On August 15th 2021, the German right-wing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) claimed on Facebook that postal voting in Germany is “not a solution, but a problem” and that every election year has significant cases of electoral fraud. In the German federal election 2021, AfD member Björn Höcke called the people to go to a polling station instead of voting by post. Thereby, the AfD points out that it seems to do much worse among postal voters than among ballot box voters. They further claim that the missing votes benefit the party Die Grünen. Due to security measures taken during the election and the counting process, this claim is rated as mostly false. According to the AfD, their party achieves a significantly lower share of the vote in absentee ballots than in ballot box elections. In their opinion this already is an indication of election manipulation. The data from the federal election officials confirm the party’s initial assumption. In last year’s federal election, the AfD achieved 13.4 percent of ballot box votes and only 6.5 percent of postal votes. This trend has already been seen in previous federal elections. However, this is not an indication of manipulation as the AfD is not the only party to perform worse in postal voting. The proportion of postal votes is also lower for the CDU, SPD, FDP and Die Linken. However, the deviations here are minimal, whereas the proportion of ballot box voters for the AfD is more than twice as large as for the absentee voters. It can be assumed that the discrepancy is favored by the party itself. The AfD advises its supporters to cast their votes at the polling station and watch the counting. As a result, according to an INSA survey, 67 percent of AfD supporters expected vote fraud in the federal election. In terms of postal votes in the federal election 2021, there has been a significant increase of 18.7 percent since 2017. This may also be due to the covid crisis. Many people avoided crowds and possible contagion by voting by mail. AfD voters include many Corona deniers, which may be another reason for voting in the polling station. It is assumed that the number of absentee voters would have increased less without Covid-19.   The proportion of postal voters has been increasing since 1990. Furthermore, the AfD claims that their missing votes were attributed to Die Grünen. The party does not provide any evidence for this statement. The reason for this assumption may be due to the high proportion of votes cast by Die Grünen in the absentee ballot. However, this is not an indication of election manipulation.   The SPD got the highest number of postal votes with 5,698,473 votes. The AfD also claims on its homepage in the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, that absentee voting is easy to manipulate. However, due to the relatively secure system, this is unlikely. The electoral roll prevents double voting by letter and ballot box. The two different envelopes ensure the secrecy of the election, and the counts of the ballots are public. In addition, at least five members of the absentee ballot board must be present for inspection. Further security is provided by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The organization is responsible for monitoring the elections of all 57 participating states, including the federal elections in Germany. There have already been cases of election fraud in Germany, but at the municipal level. Well-known cases include the 2008 local elections in Roding (Bavaria), 2014 in Geiselhöring (Bavaria), and 2014 in Stendal (Saxony-Anhalt). According to experts, local elections are more susceptible to electoral fraud than federal elections because even a few votes can be decisive for the outcome. In major political elections such as the federal elections, it is much more difficult to manipulate elections. For example, in the federal election 2002 the SPD and CDU/CSU both achieved nearly 42 percent. Nevertheless, there were about 412,300 votes between the parties. Experts rule out manipulation of such magnitude. Despite the known individual cases, absentee voting does not show any greater susceptibility to electoral fraud than ballot box voting. In addition, Germany is one of the countries with the most secure elections. In a study by the Harvard and Sydney Universities on the quality of elections worldwide, Germany ranks sixth. In comparison the USA only comes on 57th. In conclusion, postal voting is considered fundamentally secure. Individual cases of manipulation, attempted fraud and errors in absentee voting are unlikely but cannot be ruled out. However, these individual cases hardly have any impact on the results, as the AfD claims. Due to the security measures taken during the election and the counting process, experts rule out any manipulation of the results. For these reasons, the AfD’s claim is mostly false.

25;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-germany-has-not-let-only-urgently-needed-specialists-into-the-country/;Germany has not let only urgently needed specialists into the country;2022-02-11;eufactcheck;;The German right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) ranks among the harshest critics of the countries refugee policy. In November 2021, the representative spokesman of the party, Stephan Brandner, released a statement in which he claims that not only urgently needed specialists have been let into the country. We rate this claim as mostly true. On November 1st 2021, the Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) released a new statistic on organized crime in Germany which – according to Stephan Brandner, the representative spokesman of the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – shows a clear connection between refugees and criminality. In a statement he claims: “In 2015, we have been promised that almost only urgently needed specialists will come into the country. However, we realise not just now that several thousand criminals have made their way into Germany to cause trouble here.” Since Germany is currently experiencing a shortage of specialists we want to specifically look into the first part of Brandners claim and analyse if he is correct in his assertion that not almost only urgently needed specialists have been let into the country. Unemployment among refugees is still a major problem To verify Branders claim it is necessary to take a look at the specialists immigrating into the country as well as the qualifications and the employment rates of immigrants in Germany. Since the Alternative für Deutschland primarily focuses on refugees in their campaign we interpreted his statement to be directed against refugees in particular and will focus on those in our analysis rather than regular immigrants.  First and foremost the immigration monitor of the Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB) reveals that many asylum seekers in Germany are still unemployed. At the beginning of the refugee crisis in August 2014 the unemployment rate among all refugees was at 38.3%. It reached its peak in 2016 at 53.4% and has since decreased to 33.8% by August 2021. Corresponding to this development the employment rate saw some positive changes as well. Between 2014 and 2016 it dropped from 29.7% to 15.2% but managed to raise back up to 39.9% by August 2021. Despite this improvement, unemployment is still a major problem among refugees in Germany.   In January 2021, over 450.000 refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria were employed in Germany. In terms of qualifications the specialist migration monitor of the Bertelsmann foundation shows that the number of specialists immigrating into Germany from third countries is rising. In 2019 a total of 39,394 specialists moved from third countries to Germany. This makes an increase of 45.35% since the year 2014 during which only 27,102 specialists immigrated into the country. However, the overwhelming majority of those specialists aren’t refugees but regular immigrants from countries like the United States, India or Turkey. To evaluate how qualified asylum seekers are, we will take a look at the results of the IAB-BAMF-SOEP survey as well as similar surveys of the socio-economic panel (SOEP) from the year 2016 in which the refugee crisis was at its peak.  Not every qualification guarantees a job The surveys found that about 57% of the interviewed refugees which immigrated into Germany between 2013 and 2016 had no professional qualifications whereas 24% had only completed their school education or dual training prior. However, this – according to the definition of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) – qualifies them as specialists. In addition, about 18% of the questioned refugees possessed a bachelor’s degree or a master certification while only 1% had a master’s or doctorate degree. This means that about 43% of the refugees in question entered Germany with some sort of professional qualification. However, it is important to point out that having a certain qualification doesn’t guarantee employment in that specific career field. In result, 34% of the questioned refugees – that were lucky enough to get a job in the first place – were overqualified for their current place of work. Furthermore, the majority (84%) of asylum seekers without professional qualifications had pursued a career in their home country for which some sort of professional degree would be necessary in Germany. So even though many refugees had earned certain degrees and skills in the past, only a fraction of them could actually use them appropriately after leaving their home country.   The majority of employed refugees aren´t adequately qualified for their current place of work. Conclusion Looking at the numbers, it is fair to estimate that the majority of refugees immigrating into Germany doesn’t have a degree or some sort of professional qualification. In addition, a large number of asylum seekers still remains unemployed. On the other hand, it needs to be taken into consideration that a lot of refugees did practice a profession in their home country but couldn’t continue doing so because an appropriate degree or qualification is expected in Germany. Nevertheless, we can conclude that Stephan Brandners’ claim that not almost only urgently needed specialist have been let into the country is mostly true.

This claim turns out to be mostly true. Screenshot of the quote of Harald Schwarz. Credit: tagesschau.de In light of the energy transition, Germany has mapped out for the next decades to lower CO2 emissions. But the question arises whether simply building more solar and wind plants solves the problem. Germany has planned to stop producing energy with nuclear power plants by 2022 and reduce the power output of coal plants. According to the reference scenario from 2021 outlined by Fraunhofer ISE, the secured power output of nuclear energy, coal and oil will be reduced by approximately 14 gigawatt while the installed output of renewable energies increases by approximately 47 gigawatt in the next two years. Will this increase be enough to supply Germany with power, especially during winter?   The scenario states that the missing power output of nuclear energy and the decrease of coal and oil power in 2023 will be mostly compensated by an increasing level of gas- and renewable energy. Neither wind nor sun are completely reliable energy sources. Obviously solar energy can’t be produced at night and in winter the time the sun shines is too low to ensure a stable power supply. Additionally solar panels which are snowed in can’t produce energy.  Wind plants only produce energy when winds are blowing. Therefore, these two renewable energies can’t contribute directly to the secured power output that Schwarz refers to. Another related issue is the location of wind plants. As the wind is stronger in the north of Germany more power plants are located there. However, the north is not as densely populated as well as there is less industry than in the south of Germany. Due to this imbalance, it is important to distribute power from where more is produced than needed to other parts of Germany. According to Schwartz, only small amounts of needed infrastructure were built because of long planning times and the time needed for receiving necessary permits.  Another critical infrastructure which is necessary to ensure that Germany does not black out is energy storage. As the reference scenario from 2021 by Fraunhofer ISE outlines, there will be 23 gigawatt of mobile storage and 5 gigawatt of stationary storage. Theoretically this could solve the problem of missing secured power output. But the storage is not always available, because mobile storage often refers to the batteries used in electric cars which are used as vehicles. Are alternative technologies the solution? To increase the stable power production biomass reactors can be an option. According to the German Environment Agency, biomass is already an important producer of energy. As of now biomass energy is mainly used for heating, but using this energy to produce power is possible. Another option can be gas reactors. Depending on the means of transmission, gas can be considered slightly environmentally friendlier than coal. To bridge the gap in secured power output more gas reactors might be necessary. New reactors need to be convertible to burn hydrogen, which is an environmentally friendly gas when burned. But hydrogen is not the easy solution for the possible German energy problem. The production of hydrogen takes more energy than it can produce when burned again. Due to this factor hydrogen is only a viable solution when renewable energies produce more power than Germany needs at a given time. Therefore, the amount of installed renewable power plant capacities has to exceed the peak load by far. Only when Germany manages to produce more green power than is needed the energy supply can be guaranteed. In 2020, the produced energy by wind power plants often exceeded the needed amount of power. This is the case in winter, when it is very windy. Although solar energy does not deliver as much energy, wind can compensate the reduced output by far. The complete opposite can be seen in summer, however the amount of power is not always enough to satisfy the local power needs. Whenever renewable energies produce more power than the German energy network can take, power is exported to neighboring countries.  Despite all these upcoming problems the German ministry of economy and energy stated in a report from 2019, that the security of supply was guaranteed for the following years. According to the report they simulated 60 million scenarios like dark dulls or power plant failures and came to the conclusion that consumption and generation of power will still be balanced. However, critics stated that the power consumption calculated in the report was way too low. In the report, the ministry assumed an annual demand of 545 terawatt hours in 2030 in Germany, while the Energy Economics Institute of the Cologne University calculated a demand of about 750 terawatt hours. Conclusion Germany has committed itself to perform the energy transmission to a green power production. The ambitious plan to stop using nuclear power by 2022 and exit coal power as fast as possible results in problems that need to be addressed urgently. Not only the amount of installed power output of renewable energies needs to drastically increase, power storage capacities and the transmission network need to be addressed immediately. German bureaucracy is a big problem when facing this challenge, as there is little time to correct the inactivity of the past. Not only do the processes related to building need to speed up. More funds need to be allocated to these infrastructure projects. To bridge the time until enough storage and transmission infrastructure is available options such as an increased use of biomass and gas need to be considered.  In conclusion one can say, that Schwarz’s claim is mostly true. Using the data of the scenario of Fraunhofer ISE we discovered a lack of secured power output of approximately 14 gigawatt while Schwarz was talking about 15 to 20 gigawatt. Having in mind that it’s only a scenario the data is not completely reliable, and as the data for 2020 already differs there is no data that can be claimed one hundred percent secure for the future. Even though Schwarz’s claim turns out to be mostly true, it needs to be evaluated correctly. The upcoming lack of secured power output won’t necessarily lead to a blackout in Germany. Especially because in future scenarios like this, a lot of unpredictable factors need to be included. At least a blackout is rather unlikely to occur in winter as most wind power is produced during this season. Nevertheless, compensating the secured power output, that will be omitted is definitely going to be a big challenge for Germany in the next years.

27;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-spains-chamber-of-deputies-is-the-most-equal-in-the-european-union/;“Spain’s Chamber of Deputies is the most equal in the European Union”;2022-02-03;eufactcheck;;On November 26th, Pedro Sánchez, Spanish prime minister, spoke at “Mujeres Parlamentarias” forum, where he claimed that “Spain has nowadays the most equal chamber of deputies in terms of gender of the European Union, with a total of 166 women in it”. However, Spain does not have the most equal chamber of deputies of the EU, and neither it has 166 women in it. Therefore, Pedro Sánchez claim is wrong. Pedro Sanchez’ claim in El Mundo from 26 November 2021. On the first place, the Spanish chamber of deputies has a total of 350 seats, and right now there is 151 of them that are occupied by women, which makes it the 43% of the total. On the second place, to prove if Pedro Sánchez’s statement was true, we took a look on the numbers that the European Institute for Gender Equality provides. These proves that, right now, Spain is the third country of the EU with more gender equality in its Chamber. Sweden and Finland are the leaders in terms of parity in their chambers. Sweden, that has the first place, has a 47% of women of the 349 deputies that make up the Riksdag. Next is Finland, that is the second country in the European Union with the highest parity: 45.5% of the 200 Finnish deputies are women. And then, there is Spain, with a 43% of women in the national chamber. European Institute for Gender Equality (Indicator: National parliaments) So, Sweden, Finland and Spain are right now leading this list. The data shows that the ones with less gender parity are Cyprus, with 14.3% of women in its parliament, Malta with 13.4%, and at the bottom of the list there is Hungary, where only 12.6% of the 199 seats in the Országgyűlés (National Assembly of Hungary) are occupied by women. A confusion? Pedro Sánchez was wrong about Spain having right now the most equal chamber of deputies, however, his claim might have been a consequence of a confusion. Back in 2019, after the general elections in April 2019, Spain had 166 women in its chamber of deputies. In that moment, Spain had indeed the most parity chamber of deputies of the European Union, but it didn’t last long. The socialist party was supposed to get to an agreement with the other parties to be able to form a government, but it was impossible, so they had to announce elections once again. After the general elections of November 2019, Spain lost its first place and stopped having the most parity chamber of the EU. Conclusion Pedro Sánchez stated a wrong claim but perhaps it happened unintentionally and as a mistake because on one point in 2019 Spain had the most equal chamber of deputies, but that didn´t last long and right now is just wrong.

We (Croatians) spent 24 times more, and there are 2 million fewer citizens in Slovenia than in Croatia“. The claim turns out to be mostly true. To check if the demographer’s statement is true, we decided to check the price of the Slovenian census in 2011, the price of the Croatian census in 2021, the difference between the number of citizens in Slovenia and Croatia, and the difference between the costs in above-mentioned censuses. Slovenia switched to register-based census method in 2011 Croatia uses traditional census as a method. It is conducted by going from household to household where enumerators fill out DZS’ forms according to citizens’ responses. In 2011 Slovenia switched from traditional census method to register-based. That is a method of collecting data by linking existing administrative and statistical sources and databases without using a field survey. According to Statistical Office RS, the 2011 census cost 10% of the traditional census from 2002. In this way they saved at least 10 million euros, which means that the census cost them one million euros in 2011. Therefore, part of Mr Pokos’ statement that the census in Slovenia cost one million euros is true.  The price of the Croatian census in 2021 Furthermore, while the official cost of the Croatian census in year 2021 will be known in year 2022, two sources provide information about the allocation of resources for this activity. First, the Croatian government allocated approximately 23.6 million euros from the state budget for the 2021 Census – 21.7 million euros for the Central Bureau of Statistics for the period between the year 2018 and 2022, and 1.9 million euros for the State Geodetic Administration. This cost is slightly at odds with the numbers published in December 2020 in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia, Narodne novine,  according to which the Central Bureau of Statistics received 23.3 million euros for the Census 2021 for the period from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, according to the Croatian Official Gazette the State Geodetic Administration received approximately 1.9 million euros.  After summing up, as stated in Narodne novine, the cost of Croatian Census 2021 was approximately 25.2 million euros. Even though the costs from these two sources do not match completely, it must be taken into consideration that these were assessments done before conducting the census. Therefore, Mr Pokos’ assessment that the cost of the Croatian census 2021 was 24 million euros is an estimate which is in line with the numbers we found. The number of citizens in Slovenia and Croatia Moreover, Mr Pokos said in his statement that there are 2 million fewer citizens in Slovenia than there are in Croatia. To check the truthfulness of that statement, we consulted the web pages of the Slovenian statistical office and the results of the last Croatian census in 2011. Due to the register-based method of population census, Slovenia publishes statistics on the number of inhabitants several times a year. The last report was in July 2021, according to which there were 2.107.007 inhabitants in Slovenia. According to the last census in 2011, Croatia had 4.284.889 inhabitants. Even though we do not have the current numbers of the population of Croatia, according to this data, Croatia has 2.177.882 more inhabitants than Slovenia does. Considering that Professor Pokos probably presented a rough estimate to make a point, we consider this statement to be quite accurate. Did Croatia spend 24 times more than Slovenia? The price of the Slovenian census in 2011 was approximately 1 million euros, and the price of the Croatian census in 2021 was between 23.5 million euros and 25.2 million euros, or as Professor Pokos estimates – 24 million euros. Hence, Croatia has spent around 24 times more euros on its census that Slovenia did. Conclusion After analyzing numerous sources and after contacting Professor Pokos for information about the sources for the statement, we believe this statement is mostly true. It is important to point out the sources which were given to us by Profesor Pokos were not accepted at face value. The reason we proclaim the statement mostly true is based on our perception that the numbers in the statement were ‘rounded up’ to emphasize the significant difference between Censuses, which is undoubtedly present. To sum up, even though the statement was slightly exaggerated to make a point, it is based on valid data which in essence back Pokos’ statement.

29;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-corona-vaccine-kills-more-people-than-all-other-vaccines-in-the-past-20-years/;“Corona vaccine kills more people than all other vaccines in the past 20 years“;2022-01-18;eufactcheck;;The European Commission is hiding fatal side effects after a corona vaccination – this is what Joachim Kuhs, Member of the European Parliament for the German right-wing populist party AfD, claims. He supports his statement with respectable sources that are right in themselves. However, his interpretation of them is wrong. On October 5, 2021, AfD deputy Joachim Kuhs posted a video on his Facebook page, which should make all vaccine euphoric people think. It shows him in the EU Parliament, at the front desk. The content becomes what is already written in the accompanying text of his post, that has been deleted: According to the figures he researched, “more people died in 2021 from Corona vaccinations than in the past 20 years from all vaccinations combined.” The source for this is supposedly the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). According to Kuhs, the Facebook community can read about severe side effects and deaths via the link to the website. He calls on the Commission to withdraw the vaccine from the market, as was the case with the Pandemrix vaccine against swine flu. Institute communicates side effects regularly More than 5,000 people (as of November 22nd, 2021) have spread his post about the PEI numbers. It can be assumed that some have not dealt with the linked source – the so-called security report of the PEI. The document is regularly published on the Institute’s website. The aim is to clarify all suspected cases of adverse reactions reported in Germany that have been recorded since the start date of vaccinations on December 27, 2020. This includes the report up to June 30, 2021, to which the shared posting refers. This is also where the numbers with which Kuhs argues appear. In fact, on page 8, it says that 10,578 suspected cases with serious adverse reactions have been reported to the PEI. The Gesundheitsamt Berlin understands such complications as a vaccination response in which a person needs to be treated in hospital. According to § 6 para. 1 Infection Protection Act (IfSG) the suspicion of a strong and damaging vaccination reaction has to be reported to the authorities. The PEI is therefore informed via the health offices of doctors and pharmacists. The institute is then responsible for evaluating and reporting such suspected adverse reactions – a central pillar for assessing the safety of medicinal products. In addition to the 10,578 serious suspected cases, Kuhs ignores other crucial figures, such as the fact that 30,986,128 people have been fully vaccinated to that date with a total of 74.871.502 doses. This means that the reporting rate of all COVID-19 vaccines for serious adverse reactions is 0.1 per 1,000 doses of vaccine. Here it is clear that such complications are very rare in the four vaccines authorized in the EU, but the risk is not zero. In comparison, the two mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Biontech/Pfizer) may be more favorable than the vector vaccine (AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson), the safety report states. New reports about side effects are communicated via the document in a timely manner – in complete contradiction to Kuhs statement that such things are being tried to conceal. Comparison with swine flu Another criticism Kuhs expresses in his post is to take the corona vaccines off the market, just like the swine flu vaccines. In the 2009/2010 influenza season, vaccines were recommended for prevention. It was later published that some of the vaccinated substances had caused serious damage to health. As a serious side effect, the PEI mentions narcolepsy – an (incurable) disease in which you suddenly fall into a deep sleep, several times a day. In particular, the vaccine Pandemrix is considered to be the decisive factor. In this case, a certain piece of protein was more concentrated than in other swine flu vaccines. This has affected the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for sleep rhythm. In Germany, approximately 4.6 million doses of Pandemrix were followed by 86 suspected cases of narcolepsy. Due to the frequent occurrence of the disease, Pandemrix has been taken off the market. It is different with the Corona vaccines. The most serious side effect the PEI reports is associated with AstraZeneca. Out of 11,570,155 doses vaccinated, the PEI had 110 suspected cases of cerebral vein thrombosis by 30 June 2021, 24 people died. The Institute therefore classifies the side effect as serious, but rare. The response is nonetheless: The Ständige Imfpkommission (STIKO) makes a clear recommendation for which age group this vaccine may be approved. Since April 2021, this has included persons over 60 years of age. In this age group, the risk of serious or fatal COVID-19 disease increases. The reason why AstraZeneca remains on the market is that the benefit of the vaccine is much greater than the risk of cerebral vein thrombosis.   The PEI classifies the deadly side effect as serious, but rare. Vaccinations cannot be identified as cause of death “Corona vaccines are said to be more lethal than other vaccines in the last 20 years.” Kuhs again bases his argument on the PEI’s safety report and refers to page 12. The number of deaths after vaccination is to be read here. In fact, the PEI reports 1,028 deaths. These are specifically people who died at different intervals after the Covid vaccinations. But this does not necessarily mean that death came from the vaccination. In the same way, the PEI argues in relation to deaths at intervals to other vaccinations in their entirety. Since January 1, 2000 there have been reported suspected cases of undesirable side effects after vaccinations. Whether the reported deaths occurred as a result of vaccination, or patients succumbed to their pre-existing conditions or old age, is not ascertainable. Questionable, therefore, is Kuhs main statement, in which he considers the corona vaccine to be more deadly than any other vaccine in the last 20 years.   The reported suspected cases include comparatively few deaths. Whether the vaccines are the cause cannot be determined. Conclusion  The post shared on Facebook misinterprets the information provided by the Paul Ehrlich Institute. In the reporting period, there were 1,028 vaccinated people who died in a temporal connection with vaccination, but the PEI does not establish a causal link. For that reason, it is wrong to speak of a higher rate of vaccine deaths if the cause is not attributable to vaccination. Therefore, a comparison of the deaths with other vaccinations is incomprehensible and the statement of the AfD deputy is false and misleading.

Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), says as part of the launch of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report (EGR21) that to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, we have eight years to nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions. This statement is correct, even if it is the least we can do. Six days before the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UNEP released the 2021 Emissions Gap Report in a high-level online press conference with UN Secretary-General António Guterres and UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. The report’s contents are striking: all current climate pledges combined with other mitigation actions would result in global temperature rising by 2.7 degrees by the end of the century. This would be far beyond the goals of the Paris Agreement and would have catastrophic consequences in the Earth’s climate. After the report was published, a quote from Inger Andersen travelled around the world: “To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions.” The direct quote originates from an article on the website of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that was published to go along with the EGR21. More specific information on when Andersen said the phrase is not available. If you read her foreword to the report and listen to the press conference on its release, it is noticeable that she never said the sentence that way then. It remains unclear whether an extra interview was given for the UNFCCC article or whether the quote is an adaptation for journalistic purposes. However, in the context of reporting on the EGR21 she mentions that 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 2030 for the 1.5 degrees goal. “So we need to take a total of 55 percent off our current emission load on the least cost to pathway 1.5 degrees,” Anderson said during the press conference. In the Report she writes: “Reductions of 30 percent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2°C and 55 percent for 1.5°C. […] To get on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world needs to take an additional 28 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions by 2030.” But why is it 55 percent and not “almost halve” of the greenhouse gas emissions that must be reduced by 2030? For the EGR21, scientists ran different scenarios in different situations. The current political course, the conditional contributions and the unconditional contributions that the signatories of the Paris Agreement promised are taken into account. The possible greenhouse gas quantities are expressed in the scenarios as “GtCO2e”, i.e. CO2 equivalents in billion metric tons, so that the warming effect of a greenhouse gas mixture can be indicated by a single number.   This diagram shows pathways limiting global temperature increase to below 1.5°C with a 66% chance by 2100 in comparison with the current political course. The figures show that in order to meet the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Climate Agreement by 2030, 17 to a maximum of 33 GtCO2e annual greenhouse gas emissions may be emitted in 2030. The midpoint of this range is 25 GtCO2e – which is 42 percent of the estimated 60 GtCO2e in 2021. Or, if the different countries fulfil their unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the gap would be 28 GtCO2e in 2030 from the 52 GtCO2e expected by then. And that 30 or 28 GtCO2e are the 55 percent greenhouse gas emissions Andersen mentions in the press conference. If we achieve this reduction in emissions, the probability of limiting the global temperature to below 1.5 degrees by 2100 is 66 percent.   This figure shows the emission gap – the difference between global total greenhouse gas emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 1.5° depending on the different climate targets and what each requires to be reduced additionally by 2030. Different scenarios naturally lead to different probabilities. The EGR21 distinguishes between current policy and conditional as well as unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. The chart above shows how many emissions must be cut in 2030 additionally to the current path of the different scenarios. But to at least have a chance of staying below the 1.5 degrees target, it is theoretically enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 28 GtCO2e to less than 33 gigatons in 2030. This reduction would correspond to almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions – both for the 55 GtCO2e of the current policy scenario in 2030 and the approximate 60 GtCO2e estimated for 2021. All these numbers were aggregated with 100-year global warming potential values of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) and the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C (IPCC SR15). The AR4 IPCC of 2007 expects global greenhouse gas emissions to be around 50 gigatons in 2030, and current UN calculations support this estimate. However, in this IPCC scenario, if emissions exceed 50 gigatons in 2030, the very best-case scenario is 1.8 degrees of global warming by the end of the century. The IPCC SR15 pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, however, identify a range of between 25 and 30 GtCO2e to reach by 2030. Conclusion The numerical ranges of the IPCC 2018 and EGR21 overlap at 25-30 GtCO2e greenhouse gas emissions maximum to be emitted annually in 2030 to meet the Paris Climate Agreement. Thus, under the current policy scenario, we would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least an additional 25 GtCO2e in 2030 to achieve the goal of 1,5 degrees. This would correspond to approximately 45 percent, or almost half. If we start from the nearly 60 GtCO2e greenhouse gas emissions in 2021, they also only need to be reduced nearly half by 2030. Consequently, Inger Andersen’s quote is correct. RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Jana Prochazka, Stuttgart Media University, Germany Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

This information is mostly true.    The news material focuses on the issue of vaccine distribution. It cites a report by the African Alliance and People’s Vaccine Alliance Africa. They claim that Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna earn $1000 per second, $65.000 per minute, $93.5 million a day by selling their vaccines to rich nations. However, Pfizer and BioNTech have delivered less than 1% of their supply, and Moderna just 0.2% to low-income countries. 98% of people there remain unvaccinated. Despite this, Germany, the UK and other high-income countries do not want to suspend intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines. We decided to check if: (1) the pharma trio actually makes $1000 per second or $93.5 million per day, and (2) just two percent of people in low income countries have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, as the African Alliance and People’s Vaccine Alliance Africa declared. Also we contacted RT, via email, to request their comment on the news story, and provide an explanation of why the story did not include the position of Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna on the issue, in addition to explaining why there’s no mention for the news story author, but we did not receive a response. Financial calculations We analyzed sales reports from Pfizer. Reports on the sales of the Pfizer vaccine, or rather the proceeds received, are on the official website of the company. The calculation was made for the third quarter of 2021. Pfizer – Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues – 12 977 000 000 $ : 7 948 800 seconds = 1632 $/second PFIZER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER 2021 RESULTS Screenshot of Pfizer financial report We analyzed sales reports from Biontech. Sales reports are on the official biontech website.  Screenshot of BioNTech financial report Financial results for the III quarter of 2021: In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, €312.3 million and €514.3 million earned from BioNTech’s collaboration partners of products manufactured by BioNTech as well as €1,350.8 million and €2,586.2 million direct from COVID-19 vaccine sales to customers in BioNTech’s territory. 1 350 800 000 € : 7 948 800 seconds = 170 €/second (or 197 $/second) We analyzed sales reports from Moderna. Sales reports are on the official Moderna website.  Screenshot of Moderna financial report  Product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $4.8 billion. 4 800 000 000 $ : 7 948 800 seconds = 603 $/second Economic calculation Result for all three companies combined: 1632 + 197 + 603 =2432 $/second The conclusion: the amount stated in the article (Pfizer, BioNTech & Moderna receive $ 1,000 every second from the Covid-19 vaccine) is true. Our calculations were based on revenues from July 1 to September 30, 2021. So, we calculated the revenues for 92 days or 7 948 800 seconds. The second claim: just two percent of people in low income countries have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, as the African Alliance and People’s Vaccine Alliance Africa declared. We chose low-income countries according to the World Bank data. Average number of fully vaccinated people against COVID-19 by the 16th of November (it’s the date of publication of the article) around 4,7% .   The proof of these words is the official data from the submitted source.The real number of vaccinated people in low-income countries is around 4-5%, which is slightly higher than the percent indicated in the article.  Also we found the information about African Alliance, when and why the Alliance established, who is leading the Alliance and the role of Maaza Seyoum, mentioned in the article. The Alliance was founded as a queer-led non-profit organization in 2013, the Alliance work has evolved from a consulting agency in to a full service non-profit organization with partnerships and networks around the world. The Alliance current portfolio includes work on COVID – 19 research, advocacy and mobilization. Tian Johnson is the founder and lead strategist of the African Alliance for HIV Prevention, a member and convener of the Vaccine Advocacy Resource Group and a member of the Strategic Advisory Group for the Coalition to Accelerate and Support Prevention Research (CASPR). Maaza Seyoum is partnerships and communications lead of the African Alliance and heads The People’s Vaccine in Africa, a growing movement of health and humanitarian organisations, past and present world leaders, health experts, faith leaders, and economists urging that when safe and effective vaccines are developed, they are produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge. We tried to get in touch with the African Alliance and the head of Partnerships and Communications of the African Alliance (Maaza Seyoum) to find out what method they used to calculate the money of companies producing vaccines against coronavirus. The African Alliance did not respond on Twitter to our request, and Maaza Seyoum on Twitter asked for an email (info@africanalliance.org.za) request to the Alliance. The answer has not been received. Screenshot of the Twitter communication The news material singles out only the UK and Germany among countries that have refused “to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights regarding Covid-19 vaccines,” and Japan, Switzerland, Australia and Brazil were not mentioned. What is the reason for this selectivity? Moreover, there was a statement from European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen about the readiness to discuss the issue. Also we analyzed comments after the article. Some of the commentators are sure that Pfizer (as well as every other pharmacology company) is a part of a ‘medical collusion’. This people think that medical workers created virus to make money on vaccinating people. These thoughts are widespread along the comment section on RT.com. Screenshot of the comments left after the article However, some people are sure that income of the pharma companies is a good thing because now these companies can invest more money on the further research. Smallest part of the commentators are neutral. They realize that due to pandemic pharma companies are making more money and these people see no ‘conspiracy’ in this.  Screenshot of the comments left after the article The rate between positive and negative commentaries is 80 to 20. Most of the commentators are frustrated about either amount of money pharmacology companies made during pandemic or about ‘vaccination propaganda’ as they call it. Some commentators also claimed that they are not vaccinated (and not going to be) because they do not trust the pharma companies and/or the government.  Conclusion The main facts of the news material are true. These NGOs and the report exist. The profit figures are correct. Germany and the UK have blocked the transfer of intellectual property rights to poor countries. However, some manipulations give significant reasons to claim it as mostly true. The original report includes the comment from the CEO of Pfizer but RT decided to omit it. The news material has no author. The real number of unvaccinated people in low-income countries is around 4-5%. We have sent information requests to Russia Today and People’s Vaccine Alliance Africa, but have not yet received any response from them.  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

The author refers to the results of a study by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), which appeared in the same month. However, Euronews’ claim, that Europe is divided into two parts because of Covid-19, is mostly false. Covid-19 divides Europe into several geographic and non-geographic parts. Euronews: Studie: Covid spaltet Europa in zwei Teile / euronews: Study: Covid-19 divides Europe into two parts. Screenshot taken 02/09/2021 The ECFR’s study’s methodology The politically independent think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) published the study referred to by Euronews in September 2021 via its in-house website. In the policy brief, all the results of the study can be read, as well as the methodology. According to this, the surveys for the study took place in May and June 2021 and included around 16,200 respondents. The public opinion poll took place in the following 12 European countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands. Each of these countries had about 1,000 participants, except for Germany and France, who had 3,000 each. For the analysis of the differences between Europe’s regions, Sweden and Denmark represented the “north”; Austria, France, Germany, and the Netherlands represented the “west”; Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria represented the “east”; and Italy, Portugal, and Spain represented the “south”. But the choice of participants is not balanced: About 2,000 participants represented the “north”, 8,000 the “west”, whereas the “south” and “east” were represented by 3,000 participants each. The ECFR should have considered this difference in numbers during their comparison of the south and east with the north and west. The numbers are only shown in percentage. It is not completely transparent how the authors came to these numbers. Hence it is unclear if they considered the unbalanced representation of regions. At the bottom of the study’s analysis, the ECFR added the following remark: “The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions. ECFR publications only represent the views of its individual authors.” The authors of this study are Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard. Krastev works at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and Leonard is the director of the ECFR.  Europe’s regions’ facets analysed The answers of the participants were on the one hand looked at from a geographical perspective and compared at a national level, as described above in four regions or in overall Europe. And on the other hand grouped in the following categories: one group, making up 30 percent in overall comparison, has been directly or indirectly affected by the disease. A second group, of 16 per cent, reports that they have not been affected by illness or bereavement in these ways, but that they have experienced serious economic hardship. And a third group has not been directly affected at all. This group makes up 54 percent. Seen on a national level the numbers vary. The authors of the study summarise the result of these numbers as follows:  Screenshot of the summary of the ECFR study, taken on 12/01/22 Dr. Jäggi is mostly confirming the study’s results Dr. Christian J. Jäggi is a Swiss ethnologist, theologist and author. He recently published his new book “The Corona pandemic and its consequences – Economic, social and psychological effects” at Springer Gabler. This book shows a preliminary conclusion on the first 12 months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the various countries of the world, which has raised a multitude of questions from a non-medical perspective regarding economic, political or psychological consequences. Dr.  Jäggi assessed the findings of the ECFR study from his expert point of view. He does not fully agree with these. Trust in government helps along with hygiene measures According to Dr. Jäggi, the geographical divisions in Europe (EU and non-EU) have historical causes. Social and economic differences also have an impact (North-South or West-East). In some countries, the population feels more affinity with the government, for example in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, some Scandinavian countries and Great Britain – regardless of whether the governments have adopted hard, moderate or soft Covid-19 measures. Dr. Jäggi points out there was more resistance in countries with rather low trust in the government. In countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, it was more common to see that the stronger populists reacted quite helplessly to Covid-19. He sums up:  “In this sense, the differences would be similar to the refugee crisis, which was simply managed more strongly by populist governments.” Another finding of the ECFR is the following: “Economic victims are more likely than others to feel that the restrictions were too severe, and they are more sceptical of their governments’ intentions behind the closures.” Dr. Jäggi says it would not be empirically true that those that were economically impacted by the measures tended to be more critical of the government and the measures than the others. Job losses and lockdown consequences for businesses were quite well cushioned by state aid and social insurance in most countries. The study’s authors elaborate their hypothesis further by saying: “When it comes to assessing the main motivation behind restrictions, the data show that people who have been affected by illness or bereavement, and those who feel they have not been affected at all, trust that lockdowns were mainly meant to help limit the spread of the virus.” Seeing these numbers the ECFR’s conclusion seems comprehensible: 45 percent of the economically impacted, 39 percent of those who suffered illness or bereavement and 32 percent of those indicating that they have been unaffected are questioning their government’s intentions. Results as diverse as Europe Another argument of the ECFR regarding their claim is: “Europeans are divided about what they think are the governments’ motives for the restrictions: The trusting have confidence in governments; the suspicious believe that those in power want to cover up failures; the accusing believe that governments are trying to increase their control over people.” The fourth finding of the study was: “A split is emerging between those who believe that in the context of the pandemic the greatest threat to their freedom comes from governments, on the one hand, those who fear the behaviour of their fellow citizens, on the other.” In both cases of the above-mentioned hypotheses, the authors of the study viewed the results once as a total Europe and secondly differentiated the numbers nationally. In both cases, the opinions of nations vary, but there is no binary geographical divide visible as it is claimed by Euronews. Looking at the ECFR’s study it becomes clear that the regional divide is just one of many aspects of the various ways in which people have been affected by the pandemic. The study tries to illuminate the different perspectives within many countries. Seen that the study looked at both geographical and societal differences, leaves it as a matter of interpretation. Europe is according to the study’s results either divided into two parts (the south and east or the north and west) or into three parts if you look at it from the level of being affected by Covid-19: The directly or indirectly affected by the disease, those who have experienced serious economic hardship and those that were not directly affected at all.  Conclusion The claim “Covid-19 would divide Europe into two parts” is mostly false. According to Dr. Jäggi’s knowledge, it is often put too simply. The claim should read correctly: Covid-19 divides Europe into several parts. Considering the fact that the study itself speaks of divides (“Europe’s invisible divides: How covid-19 is polarising European politics”), confirms that the topic is much more comprehensive than Euronews’ claim suggests.

33;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-pushbacks-at-croatian-bih-border-are-individual-events/;Pushbacks at Croatian-BiH border are “individual events”;2021-12-23;eufactcheck;;Nikola Milina, the head of Croatian police, said that the violent pushbacks at the Croatian-Bosnian border filmed in October 2021 were an “individual event” and that he doesn’t want that to “affect the praise the police receive for their everyday sacrificial work”. Data from NGOs and media reports show that these events may have been more than a single event. The statement is therefore rated as mostly false, acknowledging the fact, however, that there is no significant proof of a statewide operation. At the beginning of October 2021, footage went public which showed Croatian police forces violently attacking refugees at the Croatian-Bosnian border. The footage was published by several international journalist outlets, including German public service broadcaster ARD. In a press conference on October 8th 2021, head of Croatian police Nikola Milina commented on the reports, saying that his “interest is certainly to shed light on this event to the end, in no way do we want the individual event to affect the praise the police receive for their everyday sacrificial work…” This statement contradicts the ongoing reports about violent pushbacks along the outer EU border of Croatia. Since the closing of the so-called Balkan route in 2015, the pathway through Bosnia, Croatia and surrounding countries has become a crucial point in refugee streams on European ground. In this fact check, we want to analyze Milina’s claim. To this end, we will first have to define what counts as pushback and as violent pushback. The terminology of pushback The term “pushback” is commonly used to describe the practice of returning refugees out of the country without allowing them access to standard asylum protocol. Technically, this practice violates Article 18 of the EU fundamental rights charter, which is linked to the Geneva Convention from 1951 and secures every individual the right for a fair asylum process. This also applies to illegal immigrants. Added to that, EU law also forbids countries to return immigrants to states where they could face torture or other human rights-violating procedures. This agreement is known as the non-refoulment principle and is also described in the EU fundamental rights. Now, what is considered to be a „violent pushback”? In the report of ARD, Croatian operatives have been filmed beating and shooting during pushbacks. In addition to that, according to the monthly reports of the NGO „Border Violence Monitoring Network“ (BVMN), there have been several incidents including physical violence, such as the use of dogs, sexual assault cases, beating, kicking, systematic attacks causing bone-breaking, forcing families and children to cross rivers, theft, grabbing people’s genitals, forcing to undress and burning people’s clothes. Furthermore, BVMN also collected cases of psychological violence used by Croatian Border Police, including racial profiling, threatening, verbal abuse, disgrading people’s religious beliefs, tagging transit groups with spray paint and forcing refugees into dehumanizing accommodation. This database is based on testimonies that are created via guide interviews and open talks with refugees. Whether or not Nikolai Milina considers psychological threats to be violence, it can’t be denied that several cases of physical violence were reported at the Croatian Border. As a result of those reports on violent pushbacks, some EU countries have criticized the Croatian government. In August 2021, Croatia announced that it would implement a border monitoring system to review reports of such incidents. Multiple NGOs, including the Centre for Peace Studies from Croatia and the Danish Refugee Council, criticized the lack of independence and supervision of the planned monitoring system. Croatia in the crossfire of controversies It is not known how many pushbacks take place at the European border in total. There are attempts from many local NGOs to collect as many incidents as possible. This map shows that many refugees experienced pushbacks along the Croatian border. | Source: Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN) The BVMN counted 1824 people being part of violent pushbacks along the Croatian-BiH border since the start of 2021. Furthermore, 182 similar events were counted at the Croatian-Serbian border. With that number, Croatia ranks 2nd behind Greece. The situation in the Aegean Sea also caused a huge controversy about the refugee management on EU ground. BVMN emphasizes that “the testimonies database does not represent all pushbacks happening and cannot be seen as a statistical representation of a population of pushbacks.” However, other NGOs, such as the Danish Refugee Council (DNC), also provide very high numbers saying that 8000 individual pushbacks have been reported since the start of 2021 along the Croatia-BiH-border alone. It is possible that people experience multiple pushbacks and therefore, getting counted more than once. Conclusion In general, it is impossible to collect all numbers of pushbacks along the Croatian border. However, the claim of Nikola Milina contradicts the media coverage and the reports from multiple NGOs in the region. Violent incidents occur not on singular but on frequent occasions. Whether these incidents are a product of statewide operation or based on arbitrariness, is yet to be uncovered.

34;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-only-11-of-german-citizens-feel-free-in-their-everyday-life-during-the-corona-crisis/;“Only 11% of German citizens feel free in their everyday life during the Corona crisis”;2021-12-22;eufactcheck;;On September 7th 2021, Alice Weidel, member of the German parliament and part of the AfD, a right-winged populist party, claimed that only 11% of  German citizens feel free in their everyday lives. She stated that the disoriented and excessive corona policy of the German federal government has played a considerable role in this. We rate this claim as mostly true. At a public debate on the federal election Alice Weidel described the situation in Germany as a wall full of corona measures while other neighboring countries are back to normal. According to the politican this explains that only 11% of the citizens feel free in their everyday lives. Since Weidel does not give a source or comparative figures, this statement should be checked. According to a study by the European Council on Foreign Relations, it is true that only 11% feel free in their everyday life. However, one must mention, 35% feel partly free and 5% don’t know. One shouldn’t leave the 35% out of consideration, it only leads to a distorted perception. The remaining 49% don’t feel free at all. Why we shouldn’t trust only one number To correctly interpret these numbers, it is important to take a look at the recent trends: How much has the feeling changed compared to the 2019 survey? The study shows that there has been a decline of the feeling of freedom in all European countries, not only in Germany. In Germany it has decreased from 68% to 11%. But in Austria, for example, 78% of respondents felt free in 2019. In 2021 it was only 15%. Portugal fell from 66% to 16% and the Netherlands from 79% to 19%. Therefore, Germany doesn’t have such an extreme decline on its own, which the graphic illustrates again.   European countries from the greatest decline in the feeling of freedom to the smallest. Another important point which Alice Weidel doesn’t mention is that although Germany comes last when the question is “how free do you feel?”, in other countries comparatively more people blame the government for the Covid-19 crisis including the lack of freedom. In Germany only 36% blame institutions and the government. The others say the individuals are to blame – or nobody at all. However, in Spain 57% say its the government’s fault. In Poland even 58%. Compared to other countries, more Germans trust the government and the associated Covid-19 measures. In Germany 65% were trustful, 15% were “the accusers” and 21% “the suspicious”. Weidel interprets the low percentage of the feeling of freedom as very negative. However, since many Germans trust the state and can understand the measures, they would not necessarily decide against measures and more freedom, insofar as they are understandable. Among those impacted by the illness, 40% in Germany believe the restrictions were about right. 20% think the restrictions were too strict and 40% think they were not even strict enough. So, the 11%, which Alice Weidel refers to are true. But she leaves out relevant numbers and facts that don’t support her thesis. Germans feel more restricted by corona measures Weidel’s statement that there are significantly stronger measures in other neighboring countries should be checked too. What is particularly interesting here is the citizens’ sense of freedom in relation to the respective measures in a country. Oxford University, under the direction of the Blavatnik School of Government, has developed a scale that shows the personal measures in a country. Using this method they developed the Stringency Index. The Stringency Index is for comparative purposes only and should not be interpreted as an assessment of the appropriateness or effectiveness of any country’s response. In order to determine to what extent certain measures have influenced the citizens’ feeling of freedom, we used the Covidtracker to determine the Stringency Index between late May and early June, the time the survey was conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations. It has been shown that at the time of the survey, Germany had the strongest corona measures with a Stringency Index of 75. The Stringency Index of other EU countries is not far from it: Italy has a Stringency Index of 71 and Austria of 68. Although the Stringency Index of Italy is only slightly below that of Germany, 16% of the people feel free, 55% partially free, 4% don’t know and 25% don’t feel free. Italy is an exception, but it shows that the Italians feel comparatively free even though they are subject to similar measures as Germans. From the end of May to the beginning of June 2021, Germany had the highest stringency index in Europe, followed by Italy, nevertheless the feeling of freedom was different. The Stringency Index shows: Germany reacts to many corona cases with significantly stricter measures than other neighboring countries. Weidel’s statement that some neighboring countries have significantly weaker measures is true. Furthermore, the Germans also feel much more restricted and less free than other countries with similar measures. Conclusion The investigation shows that Weidel’s statement should not be categorized as completely true. Weidel omits figures from the study by the European Council on Foreign Relations and thus manipulates the perception of her listeners. She only mentioned certain facts to support her opinion.There is also another country with similarly strong measures, where residents feel freer. It has been shown that the feeling of freedom fell in every country during the pandemic. Notably, in comparison to neighbouring countries, Germans don’t blame the government for the general covid crisis, with the majority trusting the motivations of the government in respect to the lockdown restrictions.

Is this statement true? And maybe even more important: how and why does Belgium spend money on this fuel?    After doing research and interviewing experts we can say that this statement is uncheckable. But we can conclude with certainty that Belgium gives large amounts of money to polluting diesel. To come to this conclusion we spoke to Miet Vandergheynst, who works at Transport&Logistiek Vlaanderen. She is specialized in the refund of excise duties.

36;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-in-september-wind-energy-only-produced-2-of-the-energy-needs/;“In September, wind energy only produced 2% of the energy needs”;2021-12-02;eufactcheck;;"On 5 October 2021, British broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage made a statement about wind energy in September 2021. During the show “FOX Business” on the broadcaster FOX he said that “in September wind energy only produced 2% of the energy needs”. This statement is mostly true. Nigel Farage is a British broadcaster and a former politician who was Leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016 and Leader of the Brexit Party from 2019 to 2021. Farage campaigned for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. After the vote to leave the EU in 2016, Farage resigned as leader of UKIP, triggering a leadership election. We asked Mr. Farage’s office what the source of information for this claim is, yet we received no reply. On 5 October 2021, he was a guest on the television program “Fox Business” broadcasted by FOX, where he discusses the truck driver shortage and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s green initiative. During the show, Farage made the statement that in September, “wind energy only produced 2% of the energy needs”. He added, because of the shortage of the wind energy, Great Britain needs gas to back it up. That makes Great Britain “dependent on Vladimir Putin, who supplies the natural gas market in recent weeks and sets the price higher and higher”. Former politician Nigel Farage on “Fox Business” on 5 October 2021 Wind energy in the UK Electricity from wind is a rapidly growing energy source in the UK. Renewable sources such as wind are essential in the fight against climate change, and will play a big part if the UK is to reach its promise of net-zero by 2050. From 2009 to 2020 electricity generated through wind in the UK rose by 715%. The UK has a number of both offshore, and onshore wind farms, the largest offshore wind farm in the world is situated on the coast of Yorkshire. According to National Grid, a British multinational electricity and gas utility company, 2020 had record high levels of wind energy generation, and wind energy accounted for 24% of total electricity generation in the UK in 2020. The International Energy Agency suggest that by 2050 90% of electricity will come from renewable sources, with solar and wind being responsible for 70%. Wind energy in France and Belgium Due to its very long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, France should be very important in wind energy in Europe. Despite this coastline, France has no offshore wind farm of its own at all. By comparison, the United Kingdom operates nearly 2,225 wind turbines, which accounted for 45 percent of European installations before the Brexit, followed by Germany (34%) and Denmark (8%). France needs to make much more, because by 2012 only 2.5% of total energy was wind energy. Belgium ranks fourth in the global ranking of countries producing electricity with offshore wind farms in the sea. Responsible for this good situation is the project “Northwester 2“, which was connected to the grid in May 2020. The wind turbines off the Belgian coast now have a production capacity of 1.7-GW. However, in 2018, wind energy accounted for only 6% of total energy in Belgium. The percentage of wind energy must increase rapidly, because Belgium wants to stop using nuclear energy by 2025. Expert’s insights Data show that wind accounts for 18% of the UK’s electricity in September 2021, according to National Grid. Expert and National Grid analyst, Nagina Uppal, told us Farage probably meant otherwise: “He may be referring to energy as a whole as opposed to electricity alone. Using 2019 estimates for a rough analysis, electricity accounted for approximately 15% of total energy and if we take 18% of this then his figure of 2% is near the mark”, responded the national grid ESO, the electricity system operator for Great Britain. Though the expert states he would be correct for the year 2019, we were still unsure if these numbers correlate to 2021. Data analysis of the claim This graph displays the percentage of energy produced by wind at varying points throughout 2021. During the September period there was a relatively low amount of wind energy produced, and for the most, wind energy used throughout the month remained below 10%.   Wind energy in percentage of 2021. Marked is September 2021See Gridwatch Conclusion To conclude, research about the claim “in September wind energy only produced 2% of the energy needs” shows that British broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage was partially right in his statement. Wind energy was at a low level of around 2% in September. Of course, there were days with for example 5%, but his statement is almost true. It was hard to find data about wind energy use throughout the whole month, so it would be interesting to find Farage’s source.

37;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-one-third-of-eu-exports-to-south-korea-are-made-in-germany/;„One third of EU exports to South Korea are made in Germany“;2021-11-29;eufactcheck;;The lobby organization Initiative for Social Market Economy (INSM) published nine facts about the EU on their website. One of them is “One third of EU exports to South Korea are made in Germany”, which seemed to be true.  The INSM is financed by employers’ associations and, according to its own statement, acts independently of political parties. As a source of the fact, the INSM gives the Statistical Office of the European Union „Eurostat“, which seems very trustworthy at first impression. According to Eurostat the total value of EU exports to South Korea in 2019 was 47.4 billion euros. Among them, Germany was one oft he three largest exporters with 18,1 billion Euros. This corresponds to one third of the total and would verify the fact. But do other sources also confirm the claim and why are the German export values that high? The free trade agreement The German figures of the Federal Statistical Office are similar to Eurostat. According to them, Germany exported goods worth 17.2 billion euros to Korea in 2019. The number is slightly smaller but still accounts for more than one third of the total exports. The head of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom in Korea Dr. Christian Taaks describes these figures as record values that even astonish experts in view of the Corona Pandemic. According to him, one of the reasons for this development is the free trade agreement between the EU and South Korea, which was concluded in 2011. Taaks says, that Germany is benefiting so well from the agreement, because many German companies are based in Korea and they appreciate each other as reliable business partners. Especially during the pandemic, the reputation of German products in Korea has risen considerably. The German automotive industry has experienced an absolute boom in this regard, especially the luxury brands. Many people in Korea bought cars and other luxury goods for the money that would otherwise be spent on travel for example. More information about the free trade agreement and its pro and cons, can be found in the related blog post. Don’t forget the service exports On the pages of the German professional medium Reguvis GmbH it can be read that the exports from Germany to South Korea include mainly automotive and machine parts as well as chemical products. These three product groups achieved a share of around 60 percent of total exports. But to verify the claim, the services must also be considered. Services means for example electrical and communications engineering. The German federal support organization for trade and industry “German Trade & Invest” (GTAI) has researched the relation of the German goods and services and examined the data separately. Katharina Viklenko, economic expert of GTAI, provides the figures and confirms the claim as well: “In 2019, exports from Germany included the services accounted for about 36 percent, so more than a third of EU exports to South Korea. Germany’s share tends to be slightly higher for goods (40.5 percent) than for services (21 percent).“ The exact figures also differ slightly from the other sources. The GTAI does not yet have data for service exports in 2020. However, Viklenko expects the share will remain similar. Conclusion In short, it’s true that one third of EU exports to South Korea are made in Germany. Among others this was verified by Eurostat regarding the year 2019 and the statistic by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Even if the sources give slightly different figures, all of them testify that the claim is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

38;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-coronavirus-can-lead-to-infertility/;Coronavirus can lead to infertility;2021-11-28;eufactcheck;;According to published research by Chinese scientists, human testicles are a potential target for the coronavirus infection COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The researchers found that the ACE2 receptor, through which this virus enters cells, is highly expressed in the testes.  We decided to check this assumption, which appeared on the page of the press center of the Human Stem Cell Institute. In addition, a lot of disinformation is circulating on this topic in social networks. We reviewed scientific articles on the subject and interviewed doctors. We need to note that many doctors refused to comment on this topic.  Screenshot of the correspondence with the doctor: the answer to the question whether covid can affect reproductive function:”the only complication is antibiotic resistance”. Among those who agreed to answer our questions was urologist, andrologist Elena Novikova. Elena is a specialist from Novosibirsk, she twice won the title of the best andrologist in the region (2020, 2021). She is also a researcher at the Federal Research Center for Fundamental and Translational Medicine. Elena was immediately attracted by the topic of the interview, she considers it relevant and requiring detailed analysis.  When asked if she had any cases in recent practice when patients had complications with the reproductive system after coronavirus disease, she immediately replied:   -Yes there were. Of course, male fertility has deteriorated significantly during the pandemic. Even without conducting rigorous analytics and research, you can see that at the moment more than 50% of men come to the appointment with the problem of changing ejaculates, most often when the process is already in a severe form. At our institute, we conducted research and found that there are negative consequences after suffering from a coronavirus disease. They affect both fertility and the hormonal background of a man: the level of testosterone decreases, new diseases appear, associated precisely with the effect of the virus on the tissues and organs of the body. Including postcoid orchopididymitis, which develops at a delayed stage, not immediately. That is, edema of the genitals does not occur immediately, but in a delayed perspective. At the moment, we continue to conduct clinical studies and research. The founder of the Institute of Human Stem Cells Artur Isaev also agreed to comment on the problem. He states that at present there is no well-proven information that in reality the reproductive function suffers from the coronavirus more than from another respiratory viral disease. He focuses on the fact that not only coronavirus, but also any other respiratory viral diseases can cause complications of reproductive function. According to him, the Human Stem Cell Institute plans to conduct two studies among asymptomatic coronavirus patients and among those who died against the background of coronavirus in order to put an end to the question: “Can coronavirus directly affect infertility in men.” At the same time, he stressed that the scientists of the Institute will equally consider the groups of people who have had asymptomatic illness and with pronounced symptoms: “Since it is asymptomatic, this means without consequences for any organs and systems, this is subject to study, and many researchers are studying it.” Screenshot of the correspondence with the doctor. The answer to the question whether covid can affect reproductive function: bullshit  The problem of male infertility is outlined in the study “Male infertility: before and after the era of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2″ (2020). This article provided examples of how the coronavirus affects male infertility. 1. In a study C. Song et al. collected 12 semen samples from surviving Covid-19 patients, and also took a testicle biopsy from a deceased Covid-19 patient: no SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was found in the sperm samples and testicular biopsy in the tissues. These results may indicate that the virus, even in the acute phase, is not able to directly infect a man’s testicles or genital tract. 2. In May 2020, data from another study was published . The authors recruited all men over 15 years of age with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and asked them to provide a semen sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing. A total of 38 patients were included in the study for semen testing: it was performed by real-time PCR. 23 (60.5%) participants achieved clinical recovery, and 15 (39.5%) were in the acute stage of infection. It was found that 6 (15.8%) participants had positive results for SARS-CoV-2: including 4 out of 15 (26.7%) patients who were in the acute stage of infection, and 2 out of 23 ( 8.7%), who had a complete recovery (coronavirus was detected even with negative PCR tests from the pharynx). However, there was no significant difference in the negative and positive sperm test groups for SARS-CoV-2 by age, history of urogenital disease, days of illness onset and days after hospitalization.The researchers concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be present in the semen of patients with COVID-19 and remains for some time in the semen of patients who have recovered. Almost simultaneously by the world’s leading ART societies (Assisted Reproductive Technologies) on March 17, 2020 American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) , on April 2, 2020 by the Russian Association for Human Reproduction (RAHR)  and on April 23, 2020 by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)  decided to suspend ART procedures for the duration of the pandemic. This was done due to the fact that the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gametes, embryos and early pregnancy is not fully understood. Conclusion: There is no exact answer to the question of whether the coronavirus causes male infertility. Coronavirus can be found in the semen of patients and can be stored there, but whether this factor affects infertility or not is not known for certain.

Though the numbers were not incorrect, RT DE left out crucial information about how they were formed, drastically changing the bottom line and possible interpretations of the claim. RT DE claims that there have been significantly less OSCE Observers during the 2021 German elections than in 2017. (Source: RT DE) The article consists of a transcript of a scene from the government press conference which took place on September 22nd. There, RT DE journalist Florian Warweg asked how the German government explained the difference between the number of observers between 2017 and 2021. The Interior Ministry press spokesman Marek Wede replied that he had no information to provide regarding this question. Andrea Sasse from the Foreign Office added that RT DE would have to direct the inquiry to the responsible office of the OSCE. RT DE subsequently wrote in its article that the government refused to answer the question. Election Experts, observers and parliamentary delegates – the crucial difference The OSCE has its own department for election missions, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which sends election observers to OSCE member countries. The purpose of these observers is to observe whether elections are conducted freely and according to democratic criteria. A proper ODIHR election observation mission consists of a core team of experts, and sometimes of additional long-term observers and short-term observers.  In 2013 as well as in 2017 and 2021, the ODIHR did not conduct a large observation mission in Germany, but only sent a small team of experts. The office explained that the team would not monitor the election or counting process in detail, but would only visit a small number of polling stations across Germany. In 2013, the team of experts consisted of two people, in 2017 there were three experts and in 2021 there were four. In other countries, the ODIHR conducts larger missions, for example in parliamentary elections in Georgia on October 31, 2020, where 13 experts, 27 long-term and 350 short-term observers were deployed. So where does Russia Today draw its number of 59 experts and observers from? In 2017, there was an additional visit of 56 people, 43 of which were members of the parliamentary assembly of the OSCE. Those delegates were not sent by the ODIHR and although they did indeed observe polling stations, they were no short- or long-term observers as e.g. there were in Georgia during the elections in 2020 there. Those short- and long-term observers are also deployed by the ODIHR and usually sent weeks (long-term observers) or at least days (short-term observers) before the election. It is questionable if the parliamentary delegates followed such a procedure. In any case, this seems to be how RT DE calculated the number of “59 experts and observers”, although RT DE does not provide a link to its source. But there is at least one other source putting the number of parliamentary delegates at 50 from 20 different countries. Experts View on RT DE’s Agenda and the significance of explaining details RT DE left out information that could explain the difference in the amount of observers and experts between the 2017 and 2021 elections. Although the numbers themselves were not completely false, the claim cannot be rated as entirely true. Whether it ranks as mostly true or mostly false depends on the importance of the information left out as well as on a possible agenda behind the misdirecting use of the numbers in the claim. The fact that RT is financed by the Russian Federation plays a significant role for the following views of political experts on a potential agenda of RT DE and its claim. Sarah Pagung is associate fellow at the German council on foreign relations currently working on her doctoral thesis examining how Russia exerts influence abroad. She assumes that RT DE did not leave out the information unintentionally. She sees a steady decrease of the legitimacy of Russian elections throughout the past years due to increasing authoritarian development (Shekhovtsov, A. 2021: Bogus International Monitors for the Bogus Russian Parliamentary Elections. European platform for democratic elections (epde). Via https://www.epde.org/en/documents/category/russia.html) within the country. The political scientist therefore estimates that the Russian government and the media surrounding it have an interest in counteracting this delegitimization of Russian elections by discrediting elections abroad – including in states of the EU such as Germany. At this point it is important to say that there is no statistical backup for her hypothesis. Dr. Andrey Branitskiy, who works at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and History at the Russian Lobachevsky University provides a Russian perspective on the claim and the subject. He also estimates that the way RT DE presented its claim was intended, but doesn’t want to speculate why. Still he sees a judgemental, yet unnecessary subtone within the claim, hence the OSCE observation missions lack relevance from his point of view. Journalists in Russia seem to feel the same way. As can be read in our media analysis, they report just on the outcome of the election and its international consequences. Unlike in Germany, there was no media debate about the OSCE observers in Russian media. Branitskiy explains that the very nature of the Organisation is solely an observing and documenting one, but with no power to make decisions. He continues that there are more serious issues within the OSCE the organization should deal with. Furthermore, he adds that the topic of OSCE election observation missions is a highly specific one. The claim and the subject are discussed, but mainly by political experts involved with Germany’s domestic policy and therefore have next to no meaning for people living in Russia. Sarah Pagung begs to differ, when it comes to the significance of the left out information especially in the political context of late September 2021. The Russian parliamentary elections took place one week prior to the parliamentary elections in Germany. According to Pagung, the OSCE intended an observation mission to Russia which was dismissed, because the Russian government limited the observation to a head count of 60 observers. The OSCE saw this amount as insufficient. The fact that there hasn’t been an OSCE observation mission during the Russian elections not only provides a possible motive for RT DE to discredit the German elections, but it could also undermine the credibility of the OSCE, says Pagung. She points out that the average reader has no chance of knowing the usual dimension of an OSCE election observation mission – this further increases the necessity of decoding the numbers claimed by RT DE. Conclusion Russia Today DE claims that there have been only four OSCE-observers at the German Bundestag elections this year, whereas there have been 59 at the 2017 elections. This is not false, but details were left out. According to political experts we spoke with, this might have happened intentionally and possibly in order to delegitimize or at least to discredit the German elections and the OSCE observation missions. The claim therefore should be ranked as mostly false. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

She stated that the overall payments added up to almost 20 billion Euros, twice as much as France has paid. The claim turns out to be mostly true. According to Alice Weidel, the German share in the EU budget has never been that high. Compared to the other members of the EU, Germany is the country which pays the biggest amount of money to support the union. Nevertheless, the statement should be questioned, because Alice Weidel leaves aside the advantages, that the EU provides the member states. The EU budget records all of the EU’s finances. Unlike a national budget, which purpose mainly is to finance social security systems, the EU-budget targets the financing of all strategies that are politically important to enforce the programs of the European Union.  Alice Weidel, German right-wing populist stated on Twitter: “Almost 20 billion Euros went to Brussels in 2020 – twice as much as France paid.” (Source: Twitter @Alice_Weidel) The sum mostly consists of duties on imports from third countries, a share of the gross national income (GNI) and a small part of the value added tax (VAT) of each member state. The size of those shares is based on the wealth of every country. In addition to that, there are a few other minor ways of income like custom duties or fines payed by companies that oppose the EU rules. How the EU budget is calculated As stated before, the countries have to pay different amounts of money to finance the union, based on the country’s wealth. For many years now, the European Commission has been publishing an annual overview of the EU budget. Up to and including 2019 this overview has shown the net balance of contributions to and repayments from the EU budget for every member state, both in absolute Euro amounts and as a percentage of the respective gross national income (GNI). Since 2020, these figures are no longer published which has led to confusion and various figures being communicated in the mass media. This confusion arises from the fact that there are several ways to calculate those net balances and to find out how much every state has been contributing.  Alice Weidel chose the easiest way to figure out how high Germany’s and France’s payments have been. She set off the spendings against the revenues.  The Website of the European Commission reveals that Germany paid a total of 31.93€ billion and got a return of 12.56€ billion. So, the net sum of payments is 19.37€ billion. In comparison to that, France’s net total comes out to be 9.49€ billion. The fact that France only contributes half of what Germany does, confirms the statement of Alice Weidel as yet. However, this simple comparison of contributions and repayments does not correspond to the method traditionally used by the European Commission to calculate net balances. The traditionally used method leaves out some figures in the calculations. The Commission justifies this on the grounds that although some of the spendings and revenues can be attributed to individual countries, they still benefit all Member States and are therefore not taken into account. The results of this method are called operating budgetary balances and could be slightly different to those that Alice Weidel stated. Since the European Commission did not publish their figures for 2020 they cannot be compared directly. Senior Economist Dr. Berthold Busch states in an article about this matter that looking at the different contributions of the member states, there are many reasons to use the European Commission’s method of calculation. He stresses that those figures, especially the percentage of the GNI, would be most representative.  A tweet without context Overall, there are two reasons to not to categorize Weidel’s statement as true: As Berthold Busch stated, her method of calculation is not the most representative one. Although she used correct figures to mirror the payments, Weidel could have been more precise. Furthermore, the way she makes use of these figures could be misleading. According to her, 19.37€ billion have been transferred to Brussels. Strictly speaking, that part of the statement is incorrect, because the original payment was 31.93€ billion. Still, set off against the returns of 12.56€ billion, the total amount sums up to be almost 20€ billion. De facto, her statement is not totally incorrect, it just could have been more precise. Second of all, Weidel uses the figures without giving more context, to justify the voices supporting the so-called “Dexit” getting louder. Reading between the lines, the tweet gives the impression that the EU is a waste of money and financed only by Germany. She does not take any account of the benefits each member state is taking from the alliance. Weidel only focuses on communicating the figures to justify the goal of her political party to support the “Dexit”.  She leaves out that the EU vastly benefits the economics of its member states and that those benefits cannot only be measured by calculating direct budget transactions. There is a lot more to it.  While researching for this fact check, the EU-Commission stated: “All Member States benefit from being part of the single market, addressing the challenges of migration and fighting terrorism and climate change together […]. Countries will benefit considerably from the effects of investments in other Member States, as they can export more in those countries.” Especially Germany profits from its central location in the single EU Market and easy entries to all countries. To stress how important the alliance is for Germany, Senior Economist Dr. Berthold Busch refers to the German Bundesbank, which published figures of the export and import of German goods. In 2020 goods in a total amount of 634.7€ billion have been exported. He uses those figures to show that there are a lot of benefits that are not considered in Weidel’s calculations. Conclusion All those statements show why Weidel’s tweet should not be categorized as completely true. By leaving out context and using figures and facts for her benefit, she tries to manipulate her followers into supporting her interests. As Alice Weidel excludes important information about the benefits of the alliance, she tricks her subscribers into thinking that the EU-membership is a waste of money and is not worth the while because there are no advantages. More detailed information on the benefits of the EU and how a withdrawal or rather a dissolution would affect the member states, can be found in the Blogpost “End of the European Union – who pays the price?”.

The news service is referring to an international study that surveyed young people in 10 countries. The claim came out to be mostly true. For the article The Guardian used findings from a study that will soon be officially published. This is the largest study to date, entitled “Young people’s voices on climate anxiety, government betrayal and moral injury: a global phenomenon” and it is a cooperation between nine scientists. According to the study’s introduction it “aimed to better understand the feelings, thoughts and functional impacts associated with climate change among young people globally”. The authors collected data from 10 000 people aged 16-25 years, by using the online survey tool Kantar. The survey took place in 10 selected countries which include the UK, Finland, France, USA, Australia, Portugal, India, Brazil, Philippines, and Nigeria. These countries were chosen to represent different cultures, incomes, climates, climate vulnerabilities, and exposure to differing intensities of climate-related events. A screenshot of the article in which The Guardian refers to the international study about young peoples voices on climate change, 4 November 2021. How do young people feel due to climate change? In general, the study analyzed climate-related anxiety, worry, functional impact, emotions, and thoughts. Furthermore, they asked how climate change and the current responses of their government impact their trust in the government. For example, 65 percent of the participants claim they feel that their government is failing young people. In the study itself, the data summarized that “many endorsed a range of negative emotions, with over 50 percent of respondents saying they had felt afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty”. One of the questions was whether the participants are hesitant to have children because of climate change. In the chart below you can see the respective distribution of the responses in each country. ©Paulina Bombel | Jade University of Applied Sciences Datasource: Young people’s voices on climate anxiety, government betrayal and moral injury: a global phenomenon | University of Bath A clear result… but not a clear result In an interview Elouise E. Mayall, one of the authors of the study and a master student in Ecology, explained that due to the study the claim is correct. But she made clear that she and her colleagues avoided the term “global”. Although the study was large and tried to be as representative as possible of the whole world, it is still not possible to make a general statement about it. Because of limited money for the study or the fact that not all young people have access to a computer and internet, it is impossible to talk about a global percentage of 39 percent who fear having children due to climate crisis. Young people are more anxious about the future Emma Lawrance, Mental Health Innovations Fellow at Institute of Global Health Innovation, and co-author of the briefing paper “The impact of climate change on mental health and emotional wellbeing: current evidence and implications for policy and practice” states that “people who are more worried about climate change and the environment, and the corresponding impacts on humanity, sometimes feel this so strongly that it impacts their decisions on having children”. However “the reported numbers of 40 percent of young people being hesitant to have children because of climate change is really high”. Therefore one can say that the climate crisis and the corresponding anxiety have a clear connection to thoughts about the future and the willingness to have children. This stands in favor of the truthfulness of the claim. Conclusion Like Dr. Emma Lawrance stated: “This study is the largest of its kind to date, and more international than other studies of its kind. However, of course there are caveats that this may not be the final number representing how young people feel across the whole world.” Therefore the claim can be considered true regarding the study but from a global perspective, however, the claim is only mostly true.

43;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-asylum-seekers-massively-fleeing-from-croatia-just-a-little-bit-over-10-percent-remain/;“Asylum seekers massively fleeing from Croatia, just a little bit over 10 percent remain”;2021-11-01;eufactcheck;;An article titled “Asylum seekers massively fleeing from Croatia” published in Croatian news outlet Večernji list made a claim referring to the refugees who come to this country, saying that: ”Just little bit over than 10 percent of them remain in Croatia.” The claim turns out to be mostly true. Croatia has come to be known as a transit country for migrants and refugees since 2015, when refugees and other migrants – mostly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – were crossing Croatia on their way to Northern Europe. A small number of them permanently stayed in Croatia and applied for asylum. The Balkan Route has been closed since March 2016. In 2018, several EU countries agreed to set up a ‘solidarity mechanism’ with the aim of fairly redistributing migrants rescued in the Mediterranean. Croatia as the EU Member State was included in the European Solidarity Programme, Refugee Relocation System, which entails the transfer of persons who are in need of international protection from one EU Member State to another. Specifically, the aim was to reduce pressure on camps in Greece and Italy who were overpopulated by migrants arriving by sea in Italy and Greece. According to the Ministry of the Interior of Republic Croatia, out of 250 resettled persons that were received by Republic of Croatia under the EU Solidarity Mechanism in 2020, only 67 remained in the country. This means that 73.6 percent of those who were brought in from overcrowded camps, decided not to stay. According to the news outlet Večernji list, migrants abuse the Croatian institute of international protection. Applications for international protection The aim was to check whether the claim that only 10 percent of asylum seekers stay in the country is true or false. As it was not clear in the article if the data were interpreted correctly, we asked for the information from the Ministry of Interior Press Office. In the last four years in Croatia, 6873 applications for international protection have been submitted, but 5031 asylum seekers, which is 73.2 percent, did not wait for the final procedure, but left Croatia. The figures from last year 2020, 1932 asylum applications were submitted, but 1675 of them, which is as much as 87 percent, were suspended. This is also confirmed in a report for Croatia by the Asylum Information Database.  Further, the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia clarifies that a seeker of international protection is a third-country national or stateless person who expresses an intention to apply for international protection pending the enforceability of the decision on the application decided on by the Ministry of the Interior. That includes asylum and subsidiary protection on the basis of a decision of the competent authority.  Furthermore, seekers have the right to stay in Croatia, are ensured health care, freedom of religion, primary and secondary education, insurance of material conditions, and can brought to court in a language that the seeker of international application understands. If third-country nationals – who enter and reside illegally in the Republic of Croatia – do not request international protection, the police are obliged to issue a decision on their return and take measures for their departure from the European Economic Area, according to the Immigration Law. Abuse of Institute of International Protection Additionally, according to the Press Office who answered our request, the data confirms the abuse of the Institute of International Protection of the Republic of Croatia, both by illegal migrants and by those who legally – by relocation – came or were on the way to Croatia, asking for protection from persecution. Migrants do not want to apply for international protection in Croatia. The Ministry further commented that their only goal is to reach other EU member countries where they can apply for international protection. According to it, for this reason the migrants relocated in Croatia do not want to give fingerprints for the European Asylum Dactyloscopy Database (EURODAC). As the Ministry Press Office concludes in the letter, these are mostly economic migrants, and Croatia is not their country of choice for a better life. Their target destinations are mainly Western European countries, especially Germany, where they can most easily find employment. According to Neven Šimac, who wrote about the refugees problem in his scientific paper called The Church and the Christian Faced with the Challenges of Contemporary Migrations (2019): ”Croatia is not attractive to migrants not only because of working conditions and wages but also because it is not part of the Schengen area of ​​the European Union.” Conclusion From the given data we can conclude that the claim referring to asylum seekers stating that “just little bit over 10 percent of them remain in Croatia” is mostly true. Throughout our research we confirmed that the percentage of asylum seekers and persons under international protection is quite low. The figures for 2020 are close to ten percent, to be more precise – only 13% decided to stay in Croatia. In this factcheck article we did not dig deep in the reasons for leaving Croatia, but the fact remains that for most of the refugees Croatia remains a transit country on their way to the most desired countries.

44;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-after-about-five-years-approximately-half-of-refugees-are-employed/;“After about five years, approximately half of refugees are employed”;2021-10-29;eufactcheck;;In an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, that was published on 7 October 2020 on the website of the Düsseldorfer media outlet, Daniel Terzenbach, board member of the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit), claimed, that after about five years, approximately half of refugees are employed. The claim turns out to be mostly true. After about five years, approximately half of refugees are employed. In 2015, Germany witnessed its biggest influx of refugees since the end of the second world war, welcoming 890.000 people seeking protection according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesministerium des Innern, für Bau und Heimat). In total, from the beginning of 2013 till the end of 2018, the number of refugees in Germany increased by 1.2 million according to the Institute for Employment Research (Institut für Arbeitsmarkt-und Berufsforschung). 2020 thus marked the five-year anniversary of the peak of the influx. Because of this occasion Daniel Terzenbach together with the president of the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge) Hans-Eckhard Sommer gave an interview to the German newspaper Handelsblatt. In this, Terzenbach amongst other things claimed that after about five years, approximately half of refugees are employed. Assessments from experts and stats on the employment of refugees Terzenbach had failed to mention any source in his statement. However, another German newspaper, Welt, reported similar results regarding the employment of refugees while referring to a document as their source, a short report from the Institute for Employment Research. The report includes a graphic that shows the development of employment of refugees in Germany over time, tying in with what Terzenbach said. The authors thus concluded, that Terzenbach must have based his statement on this graphic, which results stem from a survey carried out by the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees in cooperation with the Institute for Employment Research, the Federal Employment Agency and the Socio-Economic Panel (Sozio-oekonomischen Panel -SOEP) of the German Institute for Economic Research (Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung -DIW) titled IAB-BAMF-SOEP-Befragung von Geflüchteten 2018. The survey concluded that five years after coming to Germany, 49 percent of refugees (48 percent after final weighting) were employed. 68 percent of these refugees worked either full-time or part-time, 17 percent did an apprenticeship, 3 percent did a paid internship and 12 percent were marginally employed. Thus, on the face of it, Terzenbach seemed to be right when he said, that about half of refugees are employed after about five years.  However, it is important to note that the conductors of the study only regarded refugees as employed who did paid work. Refugees working for free were not considered employed. Also, only refugees between the age of 18 and 64 who came to Germany between the beginning of 2013 and the end of 2016 were surveyed. Taking the framework of the survey into account, Terzenbach’s statements is thus only true for the above-mentioned refugees and not applicable to refugees arriving in any other country or to Germany before 2013 or after 2016. Nevertheless, when confronted with Terzenbach’s statement, two experts, Prof. Dr. Klaus F. Zimmermann, Professor of Economics at the University of Bonn and Honorary Professor at the Free University of Berlin, the Renmin University of China, the Maastricht University and the Lixin University of Shanghai and Dr. Thomas Liebig, Senior Migration Specialist in the Department for International Migration of the OECD, confirmed its truthfulness. To make clear how important the integration of refugees into the labourmarket is, one must look at the current refugee situation in Germany. Present refugee and migration situation in Germany As mentioned in the beginning, several years have gone by since the peak of the influx of refugees in Germany. According to the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees, in 2020, Germany recorded its lowest number of asylum-seekers since 2012. However, Germany remains one of the largest recipients of asylum applications in the world. In 2020, only the USA received more applications (about 250.000) than Germany (about 100.000) according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The UNHCR also claims that Germany hosts 1.2 million refugees, the fifth most by any country in the world and second most in Europe behind only Turkey. Seeing that there are still new refugees seeking asylum in Germany every year, the integration of refugees into the labourmarket remains a constant challenge. Conclusion In short, the integration of refugees into the labourmarket remains a constant challenge as new refugees are seeking asylum in Germany every year. Germany is currently home to more than one million refugees. Most of whom came to Germany between 2013 and 2018. All stats and assessments of experts back up Terzenbach’s statement regarding the employment of refugees, however the truthfulness of the statement is limited to those refugees who came to Germany between 2013 and 2016. Since Terzenbach failed to mention these geographical and temporal limitations in his statement, the claim is only mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

45;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/uncategorized/false-the-european-parliament-resolution-on-womens-sexual-and-reproductive-health-promotes-abortion/;”The European Parliament resolution on women’s sexual and reproductive health promotes abortion“;2021-07-15;eufactcheck;;Croatian right-wing activist and president of the Catholic association Vigilare John-Vice Batarelo on June 24th posted a status on Facebook calling Fred Matić, a Croatian representative in the EU Parliament ”a person who boasts about allowing genocide upon children in Europe” and a ”baby killer”. The accusation was a result of Matić’s ”Report on the situation of sexual and reproductive health and rights in the EU, in the frame of women’s health” that was positively received and accepted by the EU Parliament.  Members of John-Vice Batarelo’s association Vigilare, including himself in general, are proudly promoting ”being woke and retrograde”. Their public discourse is predominantly composed of promoting the Catholic church and its far-right, most conservative standpoints on society. Out of the numerous social rulings of the Church, one that Vigilare promotes the most is the ban of abortion, no matter what the circumstances are and no matter how it affects a woman’s health, body and social or economic status.  Batarelo interprets the acceptance of Matić’s report from the EU Parliament as a great impact on the number of European Union-wide abortion count. It is important to note that Batarelo’s association Vigilare believes that life begins by conception and not by birth. In their beliefs, abortion is murder and by analogy keeping abortions legal is highly immoral and ”against God”. Therefore, Batarelo allows himself to call MEP Matić a ”baby killer”. Weaponizing the term ‘genocide’ In his post about Fred Matić’s report, John-Vice Batarelo loosely uses the term ”genocide” to describe the effects of the report in question. As it is cited by the UN, genocide is a term coined by the Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin and it is defined by systematic murders and other targeted actions aimed at the destruction of particular ethnic or other groups of people.  The UN will classify an act as an act of genocide if it finds mental and physical elements that indicate it. The mental element is an intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. The physical element includes the acts of killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, forcibly transferring the group to another geographical location, etc. Only by confirming the existence of these elements can an act be classified and constituted as a genocide.  Matić’s ”Report on the situation of sexual and reproductive health and rights in the EU, in the frame of women’s health” alludes to no such thing, nor does it contain any of the intents needed to even allow an act of such nature like genocide. John-Vice Batarelo uses the term in a way to mislead his followers and the public into believing that the report will exponentially increase the numbers of abortions to the point of ”genocide”. What the report is actually about Contrary to Batarelo’s interpretation, Matić’s report is not solely on the topic of abortion. In the 41 page document approved by the EU parliament, Matić discusses a number of topics, including the call for consensus between the laws in the EU member states, calling for comprehensive sexuality education for young people, demands for safe and fair menstrual products for all, demanding more protection for victims of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic and more.  Only in article D, paragraph 33. does Matić mention abortions as a ‘’voluntary decision based on a person’s request, given of their own free will in accordance with medical standards and availability, accessibility, affordability and safety based on WHO guidelines’’. In the article D, Matić asks certain member states to decriminalize abortions, as well as to remove ideological barriers to abortions in the member states where it is legal. He also calls for restraining medical practitioners from pulling the “conscience clause’’ card, a choice for a medical worker to decline a potential abortion patient because the procedure is not in line with his or her beliefs.  Matić’s report is in its entirety a document that wishes to benefit women’s reproductive and sexual health and does not contain signs of political intent or point of view. It is also worth noting, as it is said in the minority position notes in the report, that this document has no legal or formal rigour. From a legal standpoint, this report has no constitutional effect, nor does it forcibly change the laws of member states that are not in accord. The report is of only advisory nature and could only be used as a guideline for changing the status quo in certain member states when it comes to women’s reproductive and sexual healthcare. Broader social context Croatia, as a country in which more than 86 percent of the population declares Catholic is well influenced by conservative political views and public actors. Vigilare, led by Vice Batarelo and his conservative activism, is one of numerous right-oriented associations participating in and organizing all sorts of events, most popular of them being “Hod za život” (eng. Walk for Life). This event’s main goal is to advocate against abortion, it somehow resembles a protest and is held yearly in cities across Croatia, often during the period of electoral silence.  Vice Batarelo’s association Vigilare came up with an explicit anti-abortion campaign in the midst of local elections. Campaign, which was in favour of the candidacy of Miroslav Škoro for the mayor of Zagreb against his main opponent Tomislav Tomašević of Možemo, was depicted as a coin of Croatian Kuna with parts of bloody fetus on it. Using wordplay, Vigilare topped the campaign with: “milking (the citizens) and tearing up children with your money”. Vigilare’s campaign against Fred Matić, the European Parliament report and women’s right to abortion has not stopped since and it goes as far as comparing the MEP to the notorious horror character Freddie Kruger.  Also, Narod.hr, a right-wing online media outlet, reported on Fred Matić’s report as “an legally illiterate act” and “getting off the right track”, calling the right to abortion “a non-existent sexual and reproductive right” which is to be imposed on children through Sexual Education in schools. A worldwide problem It is important to stress that lack of fair and accessible reproductive health is a problem for a large number of women around the world, not only in “third world countries”. This matter and the importance of enabling women to decide on their bodies and exercise sexual and reproductive rights was recognized by the European Parliament committee and therefore resulted in acceptance of the previously mentioned resolution. MEPs referred to conclusions and points on this issue recently discussed at the “Nairobi summit” on population and development.  The European Union is facing new challenges every day in an attempt to secure these basic human rights. One of the main catalysts for adoption of this resolution on its territory is “the Polish de facto ban of abortion” adopted in the Polish Parliament in November of 2020. This act was declared a threat to the guarantee of human rights and a health risk for women by the Parliament. Conclusion To conclude, it is fair to accentuate the European Parliament resolution and Fred Matić’s report, as it goes, have no hidden agenda, especially promotion and advocacy for a greater number of abortions. The Resolution is merely a call for state members, holding guidelines to secure best possible medical care for all women in member states and wider. It advocates for women’s rights, special emphasis on equal access to medical care and body autonomy. On the other hand, Batarelo’s claims that both the resolution and the EU Parliament are promoting the increase of abortions in member states. It also weaponizes the term ‘genocide’ for shock value and accentuating the false seriousness of the report and it’s mere advisory effects. In accordance with everything mentioned, the media claims by John-Vice Batarelo are proven to be false and misleading.

Without further ado, he drops it as a payment option at Tesla, whereupon the Bitcoin price falls rapidly. Musk is mostly right about the greenhouse gas emissions involved in Bitcoin mining, but he is mostly wrong about the trend. Creating and destroying values of billions with a few tweets – that is what Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been doing in recent months, proclaiming his opinion on the cryptocurrency Bitcoin via Twitter and changing it again soon after. At the end of January, Musk revealed himself as a supporter of the market-leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin: with a simple #bitcoin in his profile description, he contributed to the digital currency’s price rising by around 20 percent. A week later, he also announced that Tesla had invested around $1.5 billion in Bitcoins. Soon, Tesla electric cars should also be available for purchase with Bitcoins. When he followed up on his announcement on March 24, the price of the cryptocurrency rose again, landing temporarily at the previous high of more than $64,000 before stabilizing at around $55,000 in May. Cryptocurrency goes up – and down again But then the turnaround: Elon Musk tweets on May 13: “Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.” Within a week Bitcoin plummeted by one-fifth. Since then, the currency has been unable to recover from this shock, settling at around $35,000. But what is there to his thesis? Has Bitcoin’s energy consumption really risen as rapidly between Musk’s first and last statement as he claims? And how big is the share of fossil fuels, especially coal, of Bitcoin mining and transactions actually? Bitcoin consumes more energy than some countries Bitcoin is based on the blockchain technology “proof of work”. The digital coins are produced through a process called mining in which computers must solve complex calculations. The more computers participate, the more complex the calculations become. Companies and private miners around the world run high-performance computers, sometimes in entire warehouses, to mine the lucrative coins. Also, transactions are checked by all computers within the network. This is how security is ensured. However, all of this requires enormous computing power and therefore a lot of electricity. The “Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index” (CBECI) shows how much energy this is. The index determines how much energy the currency consumes, based on nine parameters, including the current price of the Bitcoin: The more expensive the Bitcoin, the more lucrative the mining and the more computing power is required. The daily values are used to estimate how much energy the Bitcoin network would consume within a year if the current conditions persisted. Thus, the index is partly subject to strong daily fluctuations and should only be read as an orientation. The CBECI models a worst-case scenario which assumes that all Bitcoin miners work with outdated, energy-intensive computers as well as a scenario with the lowest possible energy level. This best-case model would be achieved if miners used only the most modern and efficient technology. The reality is somewhere in between. To be able to verify Musk’s statement, one should orient on the estimated actual value of the CBECI. As of May 13, the day Musk announced his withdrawal, CBECI estimated the electricity consumption of Bitcoin about 140 TWh per year, which would be higher than those of the Netherlands, whose industry and residents consume just 119 TWh annually. Currently, the index estimate is 66 TWh, which would still be equivalent to a country like Austria. It should be assumed that Musk viewed electricity consumption as unproblematic when he invested in the cryptocurrency and announced vehicle purchases with Bitcoin in early February. At that time, CBECI’s estimate was around 117 TWh. As the Bitcoin price rose, energy consumption also climbed to as much as 151 TWh on May 13. This represents a growth of about 34 TWh (or by 29 percent) within three months. However, in the previous three months from December 2020 to February 2021, electricity consumption had more than doubled – from circa 55 to 117 TWh. Therefore, a sudden rapid increase, as Musk claims in his tweet, did not take place. Climate killer Bitcoin? It is hard to exactly determine how high the CO2 emissions of Bitcoin are. If only renewable energies were used, Bitcoin mining would not be critical. For an approximate estimate, one should take a closer look at the countries in which Bitcoin is mainly mined, especially their electricity budgets. According to the latest data from Cambridge University, about 65 percent of Bitcoin mining takes place in China. Countries with low electricity prices such as Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Iran become more relevant too. Within the first half of 2020 their stakes of Bitcoin mining rose about eight percent. All these countries rely mainly on cheap coal-fired power, which produces the highest CO2 emissions of any energy source. Other studies assume that still 75 percent of Bitcoin mining is done in China. Therefore, China’s electricity usage can be seen as representative of Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. A movement in China’s electricity market would also significantly impact the Bitcoin network’s emissions. Within the last few years China has increased to power the country by renewable energy – most notably hydropower – yet coal energy still clearly predominates at around two thirds. In fact, in the first two months of 2021, China’s coal production increased significantly by one quarter in comparison to 2020. Conclusion After all, Musk’s claim needs to be put into context. The technology behind the Bitcoin blockchain – proof of work – has always been extremely energy intensive. Which is why Bitcoin was never considered as a particularly ecologically friendly currency. Moreover, the cryptocurrency’s overall energy consumption grew faster in the months before Musk professed to be a Bitcoin supporter than in the same period until he changed his mind. It was also long known that China, the driving force behind Bitcoin mining, gives little consideration to their carbon footprint. Behind the multi-billionaire’s statement therefore may lie a rash action or a long-term strategy.

47;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-in-belgium-hundreds-of-radicalized-prisoners-can-walk-around-freely/;‘In Belgium, hundreds of radicalized prisoners can walk around freely’;2021-07-06;eufactcheck;;On March 22nd 2021, the news site Nieuws365 published an official statement of the right-wing populist political party Vlaams Belang. According to their chairman of the department of Brussels and senator Bob de Brabandere, 398 prisoners who were classified as radicalised were released in the past five years, which he claims is problematic.This statement turns out to be uncheckable. In remembrance of the terrorist attacks at Metro Maelbeek and Brussels Airport in 2016, Bob De Brabandere claims politicians haven’t taken any measures to prevent future attacks. ‘In 5 out of 8 attacks that happened last year in Europe, the perpetrators were known for radicalism, and 4 of them had been sentenced in previous years for terrorism or violence. Instead of keeping terrorists behind bars, 398 radicalised prisoners were released, the senator states. Moreover, the political party claims The Intelligence Service VSSE admitted in their annual report of 2019 that 45% of the released extremists were still considered radicalized or capable of other violence in 2020. Attacks in Europe In 2020, out of several terrorist attacks in France, Germany and the UK, five were committed by criminals known to authorities, just like the number of perpetrators who had been sentenced before. The numbers were obtained through a parliamentary question the Senate leader of Vlaams Belang, Guy D’haeseleer, asked the minister of Justice Vincent Van Quickenborne (Open VLD – the Flemish conservative liberal party) last year. The answer to how many convicted terrorists were released was 398 individuals who were at one point listed on the Celex list. The list contains five categories of the common database: ● 103 ‘Foreign Terrorist Fighters’, who left to join a terrorist group in a conflict area, were prevented from leaving or had the intention to leave Belgium. ● 10 ‘Homegrown Terrorists’, who do not intend to leave the country, join terrorist attacks in Belgium or provide support. ● 18 ‘Hate Propagandists’, those who try to justify violence for ideological purposes, using their influence to radicalize their environment and damage the constitution. ● 3 ‘Potential Violent Extremists’ have extremist ideas that they eventually want to achieve using violence but do not undertake any concrete actions. ● 2 ‘TV’. The fifth category covers those convicted, interned or placed under protection measures for terrorism in Belgium or abroad. Prisoners can be listed under several categories, so the main categories of the common database are split up into subcategories. The Celex list, source: www.senate.be, screenshot by Marie-Julie Van de Sijpe In addition, the DG EPI (the Directorate-General for penitentiary facilities) uses other categories besides the common database to keep track of any forms of extremism. Such as ‘Gelijkgestelden’ (Equivalents), who are connected to terrorist crimes. ‘Geradicaliseerd’ or radicalized refers to prisoners who weren’t convicted for any radical or extremist behaviour but developed radical ideas during their imprisonment. The 122 ‘Terrorists’ are not only convicted for terrorism offences, but some are also under arrest and not yet convicted for the same type of crime. We contacted the spokesperson of the Directorate-General for penitentiary facilities (DG EPI) to get further information. When it comes to analysing the numbers, recent changes have been made. ‘From now on, we only use the OCAD (Coordination Unit for Threat Assessment) common database to keep track of any forms of radicalism, terrorism or extremism. Old categories such as ‘Gelijkgestelden (Equivalents)’ and ‘Radicalists’ have been replaced, making it difficult to analyse and compare old numbers to new ones, the DG EPI concludes. According to the DG EPI, for those convicted and served their sentence, there aren’t any conditions they have to consider. The government will keep track of them if they are released under certain conditions. The detainees monitored for radicalism/terrorism during their detention are, for the most part, still followed by the security services (police, state security) outside the framework of the Local Task Forces. Safety measures In their annual report of 2019, The Intelligence Service states they are keeping track of the released prisoners detained for terrorist activities. However, no definite numbers were mentioned since it is difficult for the authorities to measure if prisoners still have the same intentions on the day of their release. Their goal is to inform partners and local forces in time. The Intelligence Service also mentions that most attacks are perpetrated by far-right extremist individuals, who are rarely known to authorities. Conclusion With the statement that “hundreds of radicalized prisoners can walk around freely”, senator Bob de Brabandere expresses his concerns. However, the annual report of the intelligence services does not confirm his narrative. The changes of the DG EPI make the statement difficult to confirm or deny. Therefore the statement is uncheckable. RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Marie-Julie Van de Sijpe, Thomas More University of Applied Sciences Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

She claimed that high income countries have received more than 80% of the vaccinations in comparison to low income countries who obtained only 0.3%. The claim turns out te be mostly true. The newssite CNBC and the United Nations also covered this topic in an article, but they use different percentages than Fleming. While Melissa Fleming talks about the percentages being 0.3% and more than 80%, CNBC and the UN claim the percentages are 0.2% and 87% with headlines such as “Low-income countries have received just 0.2 per cent of all COVID-19 shots given” and “WHO says more than 87% of the world’s Covid vaccine supply has gone to higher-income countries.” Where is the source?  Both Fleming’s tweet and the articles have the same source, namely the World Health Organization (WHO). After active, extensive research, no articles on this topic could be found on the organization’s website. Subsequently, another Twitter post by the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, occured. This tweet was about a WHO press conference on this topic and was able to provide further information as well as identifying the primary source. Conclusively, this was a transcription of the WHO press conference of May 9th 2021. The press conference On April 9th 2021, WHO released a transcription of the press conference on coronavirus disease. Starting at minute 00:03:07, the statement dropped: “More than 700 million doses of vaccine were administered worldwide, but more than 87% went to high- or upper-middle-income countries, while low-income countries received only 0.2%.” Thus, the question arises as to how the different percentages in Under Secretary General Melissa Fleming’s post could have occurred. On purpose or by accident? It’s possible that Melissa Fleming posted these numbers by accident, a little typo creeps in quickly. But at a later point in the research, another tweet from Melissa on the same topic popped up with the same ‘wrong’ percentages. So maybe not a typo? An inquiry to WHO asking if it was possible that Ms. Fleming was basing her statement on other research findings was not followed by a response to date. A further enterprise was started to obtain an expert opinion on the vaccination doses administered worldwide, but this has also been unsuccessful so far. According to Dr. Ulrike Schleier, Professor of Statistics at Jade University in Germany, the difference in the figures could have occurred for different reasons. Fleming may not have used the press release as a source but checked the databases of the UN which are based on the WHO data, possibly at a different time. “The WHO press release dates April 9, 2021, whereas the statement by Melissa Fleming is from May 11, 2021. In the meantime, the figures might have changed. There might also have been later corrections in the states’ reports. The percentages are, in any case, only estimates based on the numbers of inhabitants, which are also only estimated. In reality, the number of inhabitants in a country is not known on a daily basis. Finally, the WHO and the UN might have different definitions of what a “high income” or a “low income” country is. All of these factors might lead to slight differences in such numbers”, assumes Schleier. Also read the related blog post The possible accuracy of global coved vaccination numbers.  Conclusion No statement can be made about the background of Melissa Fleming’s statement at this point, but the fact check can be declared mostly true due to the minimal deviations of the values compared to official data.

49;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-without-immigration-economic-growth-risks-being-undermined/;“Without immigration, economic growth risks being undermined”;2021-06-18;eufactcheck;;“The corona crisis has reduced migration flows worldwide. That has implications for prosperity. In rich countries, economic growth without immigration risks being undermined.” This claim from the German statistical bureau Destatis, published in Belgian newspaper De Standaard from 10 February 2021, turns out to be mostly true. Immigration is a global phenomenon with Europe as the largest reception area for international migrants according to the United Nations International Migration Report. There where major refugee crises in recent years, which has given the word migration a rather negative undertone. Yet migration has a positive impact on all the countries of Europe. “The claim is correct in theory”, says Ive Marx professor of socio-economics at the Antwerp University (UA). “Immigration does provide a boost in the economy. On the other hand, in practice it is much more complicated. There are many different immigrants. The ones that make a difference to our economy are mainly the migrant workers.” Claim in De Standaard, 10 February 2021: In rich countries the economic growth risks to be undermined without immigration because of ageing and labour shortages.” A United Nations report states, “If supported by appropriate policies, international migration can contribute to inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development.” The National Bank of Belgium‘s results are also positive: “Recent immigration has had a positive impact on gross domestic product. GDP has increased by 3.5% in Belgium. 2% of this is because of the EU migrants and the other 1.5% is due to non-EU migrants.” Here we have to keep in mind that according to the National Bank, Belgium performs very poorly in receiving and employing migrants. It can be concluded from this that European countries that perform best also have a larger increase. Clear effects Many of these migrant workers are already being trained in their countries to do bottleneck jobs in other countries. This is called the GSP project or Global Skill Partnership that Belgium is participating in according to Enabel, a Belgian development agency. This provides a higher level of education allowing recent migrants to contribute more, says the ecorev report from the National Bank of Belgium. Second-generation migrants also contribute more to the economy than first-generation migrants. This has to do with education but also with language skills. Ive Marx: “Corona has a surprisingly small impact on labour migration within Europe. Outside Europe it is more difficult to determine because of the difficult vaccination there.” COVIVAT, a collaboration between three socio-economic research groups from Belgian universities, comes up with the same conclusion: “Migratory movements from non-EU countries are therefore expected to have been harder hit than migratory movements from EU countries.” They also clearly state that they can only see clear effects of the COVID-19 crisis later. Conclusion After reports from the National Bank of Belgium, COVIVAT, the United Nations and the insights of Ive Marx, we can conclude that immigration does indeed have an impact on the economic growth of a country. In rich countries, immigrants are used skillfully, by employing them in bottleneck occupations. Yet, according to Marx, the claim is too general because the impact on the economy depends on what kind of migrants migrate.

It is correct that the UK is halfway on their net-zero policy. However, the claim is only mostly true, as research shows the scenario is not as optimistic as the British Prime Minister indicated. The two-day Climate Summit held by the US from the 22nd to 23rd of April gathered world leaders to discuss a common response to the climate crisis. At the event, the British Prime Minister started his speech by thanking the American president Joe Biden “for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change” and proceeded to claim that the UK has already managed to decrease its carbon emissions with 50%. Facts and figures It is true that the UK managed to cut their carbon emissions from 794m tons to 389m tons in the time period of 1990 to 2020 – 51% of their net-zero goal (cutting a 100% of the 1990 levels by 2050), as shown by research from the British energy website CarbonBrief. However, it is worth noticing that the policy does not mention new funding nor does it consider carbon emissions from international aviation and shipping or imported goods into the United Kingdom. As a result, the policy leaves aside the environmental effect of clothes manufactures, for example, originated in the global south, but consumed by the United Kingdom. Moreover, farming, forestry and peatland, which accounts for 12% of the greenhouse gas emissions, are also virtually absent from the plan. Farmers neither get incentives to curb their emissions nor do they get funding to support them to change to sustainable production technique, the NewScientist mentions. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic had a clear impact in last year’s numbers. According to the government’s energy use data, only in 2020 there was a 11% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to a 3,7% reduction pattern based on the average of the levels from the seven years before, this shows how much the sanitary emergency circumstance contributed to a greener world. China, for example, already had a rebound on their emissions, exceeding the levels of the whole year of 2019 only in the last semester of 2020, re-enabling the economy after the lockdown. The same happened in Brazil, India and the United States, according to statistics by the International Energy Agency (IEA): Source: International Energy Agency “10-point plan” Aiming to “turn the UK into the world’s number one centre for green technology and finance”, Johnson announced a government plan to promote a “green recovery” from COVID-19 in November 2020. It includes increasing the manufacturing bases of electric vehicles, becoming a world leader in carbon capture technology and using hydrogen for heating and cooking. Nevertheless, experts state that these changes will be inadequate for meeting their net-zero goal by 2050. NewScientist states that the most obvious shortcoming of the 10-point plan is money. The plan announced an amount of 12 billion pounds of funding in total, but only 4 billion pounds or only even 3 billion pounds are for brand-new investments to support sustainability, according to a government spokesperson quoted in an article by The Guardian. The article goes on by mentioning that some analysts believe the government should implement longer-term mechanisms to ensure that emerging low-carbon technologies pay for themselves over time. “The Prime Minister doesn’t say who will pay for carbon capture in the long run”, Myles Allen, an Oxford University professor of geosystem science, mentioned in The Guardian. Furthermore, he states the fact that it is fine to start with public funds, but it is not fair to taxpayers to invest so much money without a simple business plan for the private sector to take over. Carbon Brief’s policy editor Simon Evans said, for example, while the country did good by ditching coal power, “it has made little progress on transport, buildings, etc.”. Allen requests a “really simple solution” for financing and reaching the net-zero by 2050 by spreading the cost of the carbon capture over the entire fuel industry and its customers to keep it manageable and fair for everyone in the UK. Conclusion To sum up, the Prime Minister’s claim that the UK is halfway to their net-zero point is mostly true. However, the conditions in which this goal was met should not be disregarded.

The statement that Jutarnji list reports in its article, referring to Politico as a source, is: “The committee paid its members compensation for travel expenses, even though the sessions were conducted virtually.” This claim turns out to be false. Members of the Committee reacted to the claim Jutarnji list is a Croatian daily newspaper with an online presence, owned by Hanza Media. In the article published on April 28 2021, the newspaper claimed that “the committee paid its members compensation for travel expenses, even though the sessions were conducted virtually“ , quoting Politico.eu. We then got in touch with the Croatian members of the Committee and asked for their reaction. The aforementioned European Economic and Social Committee is an advisory body of the European Union representing three important sectors of civil society: trade unions, employers and other civil society organizations representing various interests, such as environmental associations, associations for the rights of persons with disabilities and others. The task of the Committee is to act between all institutions and citizens of the European Union and to encourage social and civil dialogue which influences the legislative and democratic processes in the European Union. Error in communication between the media and the EESC To start with, in our research two documents were found on the EESC website. One is the agenda of the 560th Plenary session of Committee, that states that members are joining the meeting remotely by means of videoconferencing facilities. Other is EESC’s document Members’ Reimbursement Rules about travel expenses of members where it is stated that they get 290 euros per meeting day. We contacted the board members directly. Given that the Committee consists of the already mentioned 329 members from all countries of the European Union, so we decided to contact nine Croatian members of the Committee. We received an answer from Mrs Lidija Pavić-Rogošić, one of the members of the aforementioned board since 2013 and the director of ODRAZ (Sustainable community development). She denied the claim published by Jutarnji list. Furthermore, she and her colleagues refute the claim of Jutarnji list that the members of the board receive compensation for accommodation and they say it is compensation for work expenses for meetings and sessions, and also that travel expenses, when they do exist, are paid separately. Additionally, Mrs Pavić-Rogošić sent us an answer prepared by the EESC for the media after the publication in Jutarnji list. The members of the Committee state here that the claim which Jutarnji list published is not true. In addition to this, they confirm that all meetings and plenary sessions are held online: “In line with the Belgian government’s epidemiological measures, the EESC switched to online work a year ago to protect the health of its employees and members”, they state in the answer and emphasize that this is mandatory not only for EESC members, but also for members of the Committee of the Regions as well as for members of the European Parliament. However, according to her, after a mutual agreement among the Croatian members, they concluded that there is no need to send that answer to the media because it has already been a week since the article was published in Jutarnji list. Mrs Laura Irena Lui, media rapporteur of the European Economic and Social Committee, confirmed this. She noted that the payment of per diems to committee members was regulated by a Council decision of 23 October 2013: “The decision set a daily meeting fee of 290 euros. Travel expenses are paid separately, and the EESC does not cover accommodation separately or other expenses incurred by committee members during their stay in Brussels for meetings”, said Ms Lui, adding that the decision to change this amount can only be made by the EU Council. The EESC then pays the members the amount previously determined by the Council’s decision. Croatian members of the European Economic and Social Committee, as well as their media rapporteur, note that members generally do not receive any other compensation or payment for their activities, so this per diem is the only income that members earn for the time and expertise invested in their work for the EESC. Conclusion In accordance with all the research and the information obtained, the allegations from the article in Jutarnji list, but also from the article in Politico, are incorrect. Therefore, we assess the claim to be false.  According to all the information received from the European Economic and Social Committee, which gave an extensive explanation, none of the media provided accurate information – neither the Jutarnji list, nor the Politico who originally made this claim.  As the Committee itself notes, the rules on the allocation of any kind of per diem or allowance are set by the EU budgetary authority, not by the EESC itself.

52;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-the-refugee-crisis-has-made-germany-more-insecure/;“The refugee crisis has made Germany more insecure”;2021-06-09;eufactcheck;;"The German right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) criticizes the refugee policy by Angela Merkel in Germany. In a press release from April 2019, Chairman Alexander Gauland claimed: Migrants drive up the crime rate in Germany. Especially now with the federal election upcoming, the AfD still holds this position – even though the refugee crisis is years ago. The claim is mostly false. “Wir schaffen das!” We can do this, that’s what German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a press conference regarding the refugee crisis in 2015. The three words are polarizing. Chairman of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) Alexander Gauland clearly positioned himself against Merkel, saying at a rally, “No! We don’t wanna do this!” Several AfD press releases talk about increased crime caused by refugees. In the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis, Gauland said, “Germany has become more unsafe because of Merkel’s irresponsible policies. Many of the horrific acts, including murders and rapes, would not have been committed if the perpetrators had not been allowed into the country in the first place.” Gauland backs up this 2019 statement with data from the Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt (BKA): Germans would be more often victims of crimes committed by refugees than vice versa. According to the AfD press release, the number of these crimes have increased significantly in 2018. This topic is, even years after the refugee crisis, part of their election campaign for the upcoming federal elections in Germany. In an interview with the newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung, AfD co-chair Alice Weidel said: “The refugee crisis is still in the public eye because we have to deal with the consequences. Just look at the police crime statistics, which speak a very clear language when it comes to refugee crime.” To verify the statement, we need to analyse the statistics on the crime rate in Germany before and after 2015. Therefore we limit the examined time period to 2014-2019 and obtain our data from the BKA’s Police Crime Statistics (PKS), the Federal Statistical Office’s GENESIS database and the database of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Unlike most studies, we decided to include the number of the population, non-Germans and immigrants. Without the comparison in percent, we cannot say whether immigrants are causing an increase of crime in Germany.   Non-German suspects are persons with foreign citizenship and stateless persons. Persons who have both German and another nationality are recorded as Germans in the PKS. In fact, the number of non-German suspects and suspected immigrants is higher at the time of the refugee crisis than in other years. The proportion of non-German suspects increased from 7.57% (2014) to 10.01% (2015). A larger increase is seen among immigrant suspects: from 12.26% (2014) to 21.69% and 27.16% (2015 and 2016). The numbers decreased again in the following years. However, with 17.29% (2019) the proportion of suspected immigrants is higher than five years before. In comparison, the proportion of German suspects is much lower at a constant below 2%. This is, among other things, due to the fact that Germans with an immigrant background are counted as non-German suspects. The statistics indeed show that the proportion of foreign suspects has increased. The fact is: The chart provides an overview of all criminal offenses. According to a statement by economist Yue Huang who did research about the refugee crisis in Germany, studies like these should be interpreted with caution since there are limits in their usefulness when it comes to analysing refugee crime. Huang said in an interview: “In the existing literature, some work has been done on immigration and crime. But (these studies) just look at the total crimes, which can include crimes committed by natives against natives, or crimes committed by natives against foreigners, even. So just using these total crime numbers, you cannot clearly see whether immigrants or refugees commit more crimes against natives.” In fact, many studies aiming to measure immigration crime only focus on overall “crude” crime numbers. These will not take into account many other factors, such as the ever-changing number of crimes in Germany over the decades. In his study, Yue Huang found no systematic correlation between the number of refugees and the number of German victims regarding crimes committed by refugees: “We did not find any evidence for a systematic link between the scale of refugee immigration and the risk of Germans to become victims of a crime in which refugees are suspects. This result holds true not only for total crimes with victim recording in police crime statistics, but also for sub-categories of such crimes, such as robbery (economic crimes), bodily injury (violent crimes), and rape and sexual coercion (sex crimes).” That means that Germans are not more likely to become a victim of a crime committed by a refugee than before 2015. According to a report by criminologist Christian Pfeiffer, war refugees from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan hardly appear in the police statistics. During the refugee crisis, Germany has largely taken in immigrants from Syria. The report points out that they much less likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants from other places who are unlikely to be granted asylum. According to an article by Deutsche Welle, there was an increase of 79% in the number of crimes committed by refugees between 2014 and 2015 – however, over the same time period the number of refugees increased by 440%. The BKA also concluded in its 2015 annual report, “on average, refugees commit as many or as few crimes as the local population.” The document added that although the number of crimes in the first half of 2015 initially increased significantly, the number of crimes in the second half of the year stagnated. What also invalidates Gauland’s statement is the fact that in 2018, the crime rate recorded its lowest level since 1992, while the number of refugees in Germany was at a record high.   The crime rate in Germany throughout the years 2014-2019. There has been a significant decrease since 2017. Gauland’s claim is based on the BKA’s 2019 annual report, which shows that immigrants are statistically disproportionately involved in violent crimes such as murder, manslaughter, assault, and rape. Nevertheless, these numbers are not evidence of an increased propensity to commit crimes among refugees. To see this point, demographic data is important. The majority of immigrants, both then and now, are young men; the age group of 21-40 is particularly conspicuous. This group is considered especially delinquent – in every country, regardless of origin. Which means the age and gender structure of suspected Natives looks similar. The share of male foreigners between the ages of 18 and 45 in the total number of foreigners is 29.01%. The proportion of male Germans between 20 and 49 years of age in the total number of Germans is 21.94%. Even though the age intervals do not match exactly, it becomes clear that the share of the potentially most criminal population group is higher among the foreign population.    The demographics of male suspects (German and non-German) at the time of the 2015 refugee crisis.     Immigrants suspected of a crime in 2015. According to Gauland, refugees more often commit “murders and rapes”, so-called crimes against life. There is indeed a significant increase of crimes in which at least one refugee is suspected throughout the years and immigrants are statistically overrepresented in terms of sexual offenses, even in comparison with German men of the same age. Criminologist Tatjana Hörnle explains to the German news show tagesschau: “The differences in the suspect load number are so large that smaller deviations […] would not eliminate them. The hypothesis that immigrants commit sexual offenses to the same extent as German men of the same age must be rejected.” (The crime suspect load number tells how many of 100,000 members of a certain group are suspected of committing a certain crime.) This also correlates with cultural reasons like traditional masculinity in the origin country and problematic social situations like an insecure residence status. However, immigrant suspects more likely have to answer for minor offenses such as theft like shoplifting and pickpocketing (40.5% in 2015) and property and forgery offenses (25.2%) as the PKS shows.   Here we have listed all crimes against life from 2014-2019. This includes all registered attempted and completed crimes under Section 16 of the Criminal Code (StGB), including, among others, murder, manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. In 2015, 233 crimes against life were recorded in which at least one at least one immigrant was identified as a suspect. This corresponds to an increase of 91% compared to 2014 (2014: 122 offenses). The total number of registered offenses against life ranged between 2,721 and 3,007 crimes per year between 2014 and 2019. The numbers of solved crimes against life with at least one suspected immigrant increased from 2014 to 2017, but decreased thereafter. Although the number of crimes against life with at least one immigrant overall remained low in comparison to the total number of solved cases, immigrants are more likely to be suspects than natives: 11% of all suspects in sexual offenses in 2017 were asylum seekers. Criminologist Christian Pfeiffer explains this: “The willingness to report is much greater, the more foreign the perpetrator is.” For this reason, the number of German suspects could be lower than the number of non-German suspects. The PKS only records the number of suspects – not the number of convicted criminals. Until a verdict is reached, a person is considered innocent and can therefore only be considered a suspect. In their essay The Ethnicity of the Perpetrator as a Predictor of the Reporting Behavior of Victims and Witnesses (2003), sociologists Jürgen Mansel and Günter Albrecht point out that “certain ethnic minorities have been shown to be more likely to be reported than the German majority community.” If this argument should still be valid today, an assault among Germans would be reported less frequently than an assault involving a non-German perpetrator. And prosecution depends to a large extent on the reporting behavior of the population. “In general, prejudices can influence who is considered a suspect and who is not,” says political scientist J. Olaf Kleist in an interview with SPIEGEL. The idea that more refugees will increase the crime rate in the country is a social problem, not a cultural one. Conclusion If you only look at the numbers, Gauland is right in his thesis. The number of refugees as suspects has increased since Merkel’s refugee policy. However, one cannot conclude that Germany has become more insecure as a result. Studies have shown not only that war refugees from Syria barely appear in the police statistics, Germans are also not more likely to become a victim of a crime committed by a refugee than before 2015. The majority of refugees living in Germany are male, young, poorer than average and residents of large cities. These factors statistically increase the risk of becoming a criminal. Since the German majority society has a more balanced gender distribution, a more even age structure and is wealthier on average, a distorted picture emerges. In summary, the underlying immigration processes are highly diverse with respect to social life situations, origin and demographic structure. Thus, we conclude that the statement made by Alexander Gauland is mostly false.

53;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-wind-is-the-most-important-source-of-energy/;“Wind is the most important source of energy“;2021-06-07;eufactcheck;;On 5thMarch 2021, Tagesschau.de reported on the energy supply in Germany and stated wind as the most important source of electricity. They claim that in 2020 for the first time more electric power had been generated with wind energy than with coal and that renewable energy achieves a record high. The claim turns out to be mostly true. The article of the German public news service Tagesschau.de refers to the results of the latest data collection of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany relating to the electricity generation in 2020 in Germany. All of the described information and facts in the article are extracted from the press release number 101, published on 5th March 2021 of the Federal Statistical Office which can be regarded as the primary source of the claim. Screenshot of the article of Tagesschau.de on 5th march, 2021 with the headline “Production in Germany: Wind is the most important electricity source” and first paragraph “Not the coal fired power stations did produce most of the electricity in Germany in the last year but wind generators. Meanwhile renewable energies are achieving a record share.” Wind Energy Tagesschau.de claims that wind energy became in 2020 the most important source of electricity in Germany. This is the conclusion of the results of the Federal Statistical Office. Referring to the vague term “most important”, the article claims that in 2020, wind generators produced the highest share of all electricity in Germany for the first time and thus more electricity than coal power plants. The Federal Network Agency, which refers to the SMARD electricity market data for Germany, confirms this claim. However, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE confirms it in parts, but frames the same information with the word “again”. Therefore, wind energy did not overtake coal energy for the first time in 2020 but again. The platform EconStor, a service of the Leibniz Information Centre for Economics, released an article which conveys that in 2019 wind power had for the first time the highest proportion in the energy mix in Germany. According to Tagesschau.de and the Federal Statistical Office the proportion of wind power in the energy mix reached 25.6% while coal reached only 24.8%. In comparison with data of other sources, the numbers vary a little because of the difference between the production and feed of electricity. The claimed numbers are based on the production and feed of electricity according to the data of the primary source. The Federal Network Agency only refers to the production and reports that wind energy reached a proportion of 27.4%. On the other hand, the Federal Ministry of Economics states a share of wind power in the German consumption of electricity of 23.7%. By comparison and recalculation all data confirm the statement in the article. Furthermore, Tagesschau.de claims, that wind generators produced 5.4% more electricity in 2020 than in 2019, which is true according to the Federal Statistical Office. Renewable Energies Moreover, Tagesschau.de claims that renewable energies altogether (not only wind energy) have reached a record share. Assuming that the term “record share” refers to a new high level of renewable energies, this can be confirmed with the information from the Federal Statistical Office. In the further course of the report from Tagesschau.de, it is said that the share of renewable energies in the amount of electricity generated and fed into the grid in Germany reached a new high in 2020 – rising from 42.3% in 2019 to 47.0% in 2020. This change of 4.7 percentage points is also confirmed by the data of the German Federal Statistical Office. But it is more difficult to compare these with other sources, as the other sources only indicate the net electricity generated by renewable energies, so according to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the share increased from 46% in 2019 to 50.5% in 2020.  Total quantity of produced electricity Referring to the total amount of produced electricity, Tagesschau.de claims that 502.6 billion kilowatt-hours of the electricity produced in Germany had been fed into its grid in 2020, which is 5.9% less than in 2019. The primary source confirms this statement, though these published data are provisional results. Furthermore Tagesschau.de quotes the Federal Statistical Office by writing that the exported electricity amount dropped by eight percent. With 67 billion kilowatt-hours the export still outmatches the imported amount of electricity, which has increased by 19,7% to 40.1 billion kilowatt-hours. The primary source confirms this information, though it made a transmission error in the text of the press release. The published tables within the framework of the press release show that the number of 40.1 billion kilowatt-hours refers to the year 2019 and not 2020. Therefore, there has been a gain of 19.7% from 40.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 2019 to 48 billion kilowatt-hours in 2020. Screenshot of the table referring to the imports and exports in the press release of the Federal Statistical Office. Conclusion In short, Tagesschau.de claims that wind energy is the most important source of energy in Germany. This statement refers to the year 2020. The claim is confirmed by the primary source, a press release referring to the latest statistical data gathering about the electricity production in Germany in 2020. In general, also other sources confirm the claims of the article of Tagesschau.de. However, the concrete numbers of the data of other sources deviate from the claimed ones in the article and the primary source due to differing counting methods. Furthermore, other sources report wind energy as the major source of electricity already in 2019 while the primary source claims wind energy overtook coal energy for the first time in 2020. Therefore, the main claim of Tagesschau.de is only true to that effect that wind energy is still the most important energy source referring to the highest proportion in the energy mix. In conclusion, the claim is mostly true.

54;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-the-us-and-china-have-been-leading-in-investment-into-ai/;The US and China have been “leading in investment into AI”;2021-06-04;eufactcheck;;“The US and China have been the ones that have been innovators, and leading in investment into AI”, EU law professor Anu Bradford said. In April, she made the statement in an article discussing the European Union’s approach to artificial intelligence in the newspaper Financial Times. Research shows her claim is mostly true. In April, the European Commission unveiled plans to become the first global bloc with rules on the use of artificial intelligence, in a bid to put European values at the heart of this rapidly developing technology. “We will be the first continent where we will give guidelines. So if you want to use AI applications, go to Europe. You will know what to do and how to do it,” Thierry Breton, French commissioner in charge of the bloc’s digital policy, said according to the Financial Times. The new regulation seeks to balance the idea that the European Union needs to become a technological superpower and enter the game with China and the United Statis without compromising its European values and fundamental rights. In short, the EU wants to rein in the way governments can handle AI, while also encouraging start-up companies to experiment and innovate. Developments and patents A study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation mentioned by France24 measured the level of artificial intelligence development using different parameters. The United States leads the ranking with a total of 44.6 points on a scale of 100, followed by China with 32 and the European Union with 23.3. The report is based on data from 2020. The data available on the volume of artificial intelligence patents filed globally still gives a clear advantage to the United States over all the competitors. According to Statista, a German company specialized in market and consumer data, the US had a total of 279.145 registered AI patents by March 2019. China, ranked second, was far behind with 66.508 AI patents. Diagram made by Diego Álvarez de Arcaya and Tim Wille According to Statista data, we can find most of the European countries after the United States and the Asian powers China and Japan. Each country’s patent is counted as one, but it would be interesting to see how all European countries join forces and share their information to become the leaders in the sector. However, the Chinese may have come closer to the US ones in the last two years. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) reported that during 2019 China had registered the most patents, with a total of 58.990, followed by the United States with 57.840. Among the Chinese companies, the telecom giant Huawei registered the most patents. Everybody versus China In a report recently published by the US National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI), the American government mentions that “China is determined to surpass us in artificial intelligence leadership” and that the US government should establish a technological alliance with its usual partners, including the European Union (EU) and Southeast Asian countries as Japan and South Korea, to confront the Asian giant. It is pointed out that such an alliance must be based on democratic values in face of China’s use of AI “as a tool of repression and surveillance”. The NSCAI wants to create an “emerging technology coalition”, a supranational body in which to develop standards and common rules for all members. The report highlights the high level of innovation that China has demonstrated in recent years, making it likely that, if the United States does not act, China will overtake the US in the domain of artificial intelligence. In Politico, Eric Schmidt, NSCAI’s president and Google’s former CEO, points out that the US and the EU should make the flow of information exchange as rich and free as possible in order to be able to cope with China’s emerging strength. Furthermore, he argues that there is little choice for Europe: either ally with the United States in AI or be left out of the technological race to AI. Conclusion We note that the United States has led the sector with total superiority, but that China has reversed and won a small battle against the Americans in recent year. Data on, for example, patents concerning artificial intelligence show European countries lagging behind the US and China. However, the bloc’s countries’ patents are counted per country. For its part, the European Union has been the first to think about the future in order to legally regulate any aspect of AI. The US, seeing how China is working with these technologies, is demanding a change and calls on Europe to work together so that the Asian giant does not overtake it. We find the claim that the US and China have been leading in investment into AI mostly true.

How come nothing came out of bats in last thousand years but only yesterday?” he mentioned. The claim turns out to be false.WHO-convened global study about origins of SARS-Cov-2, researches test different claims related to Covid-19 virus geneses. It is concluded that in order to check the aforementioned claim, all high-facility biosecurity laboratories of the world should be investigated. According to the same report, bats have been identified as the hosts of a series of important zoonotic viruses (for example, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and SARS-CoV), including coronaviruses with considerable genetic diversityScientists have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) were caused by viruses that originated in bats, with other animals serving as intermediate hosts, flying mammals are considered the reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2 as well.27 world scientists published a joint-statement in Lancet journal, stating that the claims distributed  about Covid- 19 has political motives and the virus was originated from nature. They did so in defense of Chinese scientists, healthcare workers, and public intellectuals.  “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” scientists say. Besides, the U.S. National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases notified that Covid-19 belongs to a virus family that is contagious among humans and animals. WHO’s study also acknowledges that possible source of the virus is exotic animal markets located in Wuhan, China. Eddie Holmes, virologist from the University of Sydney, also supported the idea, saying that virus was transmitted from animal to human. Another study by WHO from early during pandemic also stated that facts collected so far at that point do not corroborate that the virus was produced in a laboratory. “All facts lead to a conclusion that the virus is animal-origin. Researchers who studied the genetics of the virus believe that it doesn’t look like a sort came out of laboratory,” the report says.  ConclusionIn conclusion, there is an evidence that infections have been originated from the bats in the past, but there is no proof that the virus was produced in a laboratory, however, more investigation is needed in order to better understand the origins of the virus. Thus, the MP’s claim was false.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Heydar Isayev, GIPA’s Caucasus School of Journalism and Media Management Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

56;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-8-out-of-10-migrants-who-came-to-europe-in-2020-were-men/;“8 out of 10 migrants who came to Europe in 2020 were men”;2021-05-28;eufactcheck;;Nicolas Bay, vice-president of the European Identity and Democracy Group, claimed during the plenary session of 19 January that more than eight out of ten migrants to are adult men. This claim is based on an official Frontex press release and turns out to be true. “Though it’s not the whole picture,” says Ciara Bottomley, press officer for Migration at the European Commission. Bay’s statement can be easily misunderstood when someone is not aware of the difference between regular and irregular migrants. Also, note that a migrant is different from a refugee or an asylum seeker. In a European context, an irregular migrant is not originally from the European Union and doesn’t meet the requirements to set foot in, remain and live in an EU Member State. A migrant is a person who has had their residence in a country that is not their birth country for more than one year. A decline in the number of irregular migrants  “The pressure generated by the European migration policy is absolutely unbearable: we must expel all illegal immigrants and close our external borders. Only total firmness will discourage those illegal immigrants who would like to try their luck and will finally allow us to control our migration policy,” said Nicolas Bay during the plenary session. Bay is MEP and a member of the French right-wing party Rassemblement National. According to him, the European migration policy is unbearable and incapable of solving the massive and unmanageable flows at our external borders. But if one looks closely at the statistics of the Frontex press release, the migration picture becomes totally different. The plenary booklet from I&D bundles their members’ statements.Screenshot by Jellen Monsieur In 2020 the number of irregular migrants trying to enter Europe via the outside borders declined compared to previous years. This is in contrast with the image Bay creates. According to the Frontex press release, the main reason for fewer irregular migrants is the pandemic. “It’s noteworthy that it has become more difficult for migrants to reach the EU borders since last year,” says press officer Ciara Bottomley. “This is partially due to COVID-19.” Bottomley also mentions the increase in tension between Turkey and Greece as one reason fewer migrants are reaching the EU external borders. Statistics do not lie Frontex said it was not able to provide us with the concrete data of this press release. “The data in the press release are sent restrictedly to Frontex by the European member states,” clarifies Frontex. In their press release, children contributed to approximately ten per cent of irregular migrants compared to 23 per cent the year before. Also, the number of women decreased to only ten per cent of the irregular migrants, whereas 25 per cent of the total number were women in 2019. Therefore, it is fair to say that the number of men accounted for eight out of ten irregular migrants. Nevertheless, Nicolas Bay’s statement and the press release from Frontex talk only about the situation of irregular migrants. If a person is eligible for asylum to enter Europe, he or she will be counted as a regular migrant and will thus not be included in the mentioned Frontex statistics. Ciara Bottomley explained that one of the reasons men are overrepresented is that men tend to try to get asylum first to be later able to let their family come over as regular migrants legally. This is because of the rough conditions when travelling to Europe. If you look at the overall picture and study the statistics of the European Union of the people who are granted asylum, the ratio is not the same as mentioned in Bay’s statement. The share of women and children is much larger than two out of ten and differs in each Member State. We contacted Nicolas Bay, but he did not respond to our request to elaborate on his statement. Conclusion Therefore, Nicolas Bay’s statement is true, but his statement is only true if you consider the data available about irregular migrants. Therefore we would conclude the statement to be mostly true. If you add the data regarding regular migrants, his statement would not be true anymore.

57;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-the-uk-is-setting-the-most-ambitious-target-to-cut-emissions-in-the-world/;“The UK is setting the most ambitious target to cut emissions in the world”;2021-05-28;eufactcheck;;The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his country is cutting carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 in what he claims is ‘the most ambitious target in the world’. He made this claim on the 20th of April 2021, days after it was agreed stronger pledges were necessary to tackle climate change. The claim turns out to be mostly true. Climate target A press release on the website of the UK Government confirms Johnson’s claim to set in law world’s most ambitious climate change target. The target entails cutting emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to the 1990 levels. The UK’s sixth Carbon Budget will incorporate its share of international aviation and shipping emissions for the first time. If the target set Johnson is to be achieved, it would bring the UK more than three-quarters on the way to net zero by 2050. Should the UK want to reach these ambitious goals, a fundamental restructuring in several different areas is needed. The UK will need to change the way it powers its homes, cars and factories. Changes will also need to be made in how the country feeds its people and in what it does to dispose of carbon dioxide. It is possible that Britain’s progress in cutting carbon emissions won’t last for much longer. The UK was able to reduce its carbon output by 38% since 1990, which is more than any other major country, but this was mainly possible because of the collapse of the British coal sector. From now on it is going to be much harder for the country to continue to decarbonize.British opposition parties and environmental campaigners are scared that Prime Minister Johnson didn’t realize this while setting his new target. They say that the new target lacks policies to actually deliver. Tom Burke, former government adviser, thinks the new approach to cut emissions, so far, has looked like a “Boris blunderbuss”. In a The Guardian article Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary, shares Burke’s opinion: “Boris Johnsons 10-point proposals are low on ambitions and contain several reheated pledges. It is nowhere near the scale of what is required.” Miliband feels that the UK needs a bold green economic stimulant. The 10-point proposal, called “the green industrial revolution” wants half of the cars on the road to be electric by 2030. The plan also entails ending the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by that same year, which is ten years ahead of the previous schedule. According to the UK’S Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, the government’s spending hasn’t matched up with Johnson’s statements. Johnson’s New Deal includes 0.2% of British GDP, very little compared to the US. Biden’s budget amounts to around 9% of the US GDP. This is a big difference, but keep in mind that the US is currently in a far worse position climate wise. Partly due to Trump’s mismanagement. Another complicating factor is the UK currently being in flux, somewhat because of the pandemic, but also because of its exit out of the EU. Brexit has left huge policy gaps and the country will likely have less access to key EU mechanisms that have supported the country’s previous emission wins. These elements will impact the pace in which the UK can achieve its climate change goals. Experts According to the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) the UK is indeed one of the leaders in the climate change rankings. At the top of the CCPI ranking is Sweden. The United Kingdom is, however, not in first place. Despite Sweden, UK and Norway ranking high, the UK still does not perform well enough in all categories to keep the rise in global temperature below two degrees Celsius. Unless the countries can meet the target set by the Paris Agreement five years ago, the CCPI does not want to give them these top spots. Expert Geert Fremout points out that CCPI measures the current state of emissions, while statistics by Bloomberg are more focused on the probability of countries reaching their targets. Bloomberg statistics show that the UK is indeed in a leading position, but some shade must be added to this: if EU members were to be ranked individually, some of them could outperform the UK’s score, Finland for example. The UK has been on the fore front for some time and seems to be upping its game by introducing this new target. UK-expert Ivan Ollevier thinks nuance is needed. “Johnson is a man who plays with words and makes a lot of promises. It’s typical of him to speak in big numbers and ambitions. The billions of dollars he promised for social projects in Northern England still aren’t there and there’s no indication of how he plans to collect that money. But as mayor of London, he did promote cycling and he made the change to electric buses. Those are things that play in his favor.” Ollevier adds that Johnson had already promised an ambitious climate policy in his last campaign. He thinks the PM will follow through on his words as he seeks to give the electorate what it wants. “The UK, more specifically the conservative party, has always cared about the environment. Many aristocratic families showed great concern for their land, wanting to pass it on to future generations. Those plots of land still remain to this day as national parks.” “Many around Johnson are critical, but most are waiting to see what steps he will take,” notes Ollevier. “We don’t know how he wants to reach the target. Maybe he’ll succeed. When he said he was going to realize Brexit, everyone laughed at him, but he did realize it in the end. We should give him the benefit of the doubt.” Conclusion In short, Prime Minister Boris Johnson claims that the UK has set the most ambitious target to cut emissions in the world and his claim is mostly true. According to BloombergNEF statistics, the UK has set the most ambitious climate targets in all but one category. However, nuance is necessary as the European Union (EU) counts as one country. If EU countries would be ranked separately, the UK would not remain in first place. Also, keep in mind that it is not a given that the UK will actually reach their targets by maintaining the proposed plan: Johnson has yet to come up with concrete steps to achieve a 78% cut by 2035.

58;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-mexico-moves-to-require-biometric-data-from-cellphone-users/;“Mexico moves to require biometric data from cellphone users”;2021-05-26;eufactcheck;;This fact check examines the origin and authenticity of the statement “Mexico moves to require biometric data from cellphone users“, made in an ABC News article. The article says that Mexico’s Senate passed legislation to require biometric data from everyone who wants to buy a cellphone or use a mobile provider’s services in order to create a register to help fight crime in the country.  The claim turns out to be true. The topic is important from a European perspective because, reportedly, there are more than 190,000 EU citizens living in the Mexican Federation. Shortly before Mexico’s Senate’s decision, the European Commission had announced that a European citizens’ initiative to ban mass biometric surveillance would be registered. That’s why we decided to check the Mexican government’s decision which impacts the monitoring and privacy of mobile device users. The validation of this information was necessary because contradictory messages appeared in the media space. In the ABC News article from April 15th, 2021 it is stated that “Mexico’s Senate passed legislation to require cellphone companies to gather customers’ biometric data“. The claim is factual, based on official information and its subject is clearly defined as the biometric data from cellphone users. The author of the claim is Mexico’s Senate and its claim was based on a primary source — the Ordinary session of the Senate. The Senate of Mexico announced in its verified Twitter account that with 54 votes in favor, 49 against and 10 abstentions, the Federal Law of Telecommunications and Broadcasting was reformed and would lead to the establishment of a “National Register of Mobile Phone Users”.  Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador reassured that this measure is “just a registry“ in favor of the population’s safety and that the government would “never spy on anybody“. What happens in the field? An interesting fact is that three months before the Mexico’s Senate’s decision, the European Commission had announced that it would register a European citizens’ initiative to ban mass biometric surveillance. The organizers of the initiative urge the EC to propose a bill to permanently end the indiscriminate and arbitrary use of biometric data in ways that could lead to mass surveillance or illegal interference related to fundamental rights. This initiative is in total conflict with the decision made in Mexico. A group of 40 MEPs in the European Parliament urged EU lawmakers to outlaw automated recognition of people’s sensitive characteristics (such as gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, health status and disability) — warning that such AI-fueled practices pose too great a rights risk.  The MEPs wrote in an open letter to the Commission that “biometric mass surveillance technology in publicly accessible spaces is widely being criticized for wrongfully reporting large numbers of innocent citizens, systematically discriminating against under-represented groups and having a chilling effect on a free and diverse society. This is why a ban is needed”.  On April 16th, 2021 a legal provision was published online in the Official Journal of the Federation of Mexico, which made the Senatre’s decision an effective decree. It says that The Federal Law of Telecommunications and Broadcasting has been changed. All the details around the newly added “National Register of Mobile Phone Users” are thoroughly described. Foreigners in Mexico We would like to note that it is confusing how all the European countries are struggling to limit the mass biometric surveillance while at the same time Mexico’s Senate passed legislation in favor of it. How will it affect foreign citizens living in Mexico? We tried to find official statistics about how many foreigners are living in Mexico, but we couldn’t find a source other than Wikipedia. According to it, there are around one million foreign-born people residing in the Federation, and more than 190,000 of them are EU citizens. When we tried to check Wikipedia’s references to confirm the number, we couldn’t find the information we needed in the links. Regardless of that, there are EU citizens living in the country, no matter the number.   Table 1. Screenshot of the Immigration to Mexico by region. [Photo]. In: Wikipedia, 14.05.2021 [cited 18.05.2021]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Mexico This would set the question: Does the GDPR EU law apply here to protect its citizens in a so-called by the law third-party country (a term used in GDPR to refer to countries outside of the EU and EEA)? In Chapter 2, Art. 5 e. it is written: “Personal data shall be … kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary…” This sentence, which more or less summarizes the GDPR, is in direct conflict with the new change in the Mexican law. There is still no information about the rights of the EU citizens and it is unclear how the EU will respond. Conclusion In short, we can conclude that the topic of biometric data and its surveillance is very important in global perspective for the citizens. The changes made in the Mexican legislation are confirmed despite the fact that they raise some questions concerning their future impact on the European citizens and other foreigners living there. Nevertheless, the claim in the article remains true.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Anna Avramova, Plamena Todorova, Petya Georgieva, Sofia University “St. Kliment Ohridski”, BG Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

59;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-europe-gave-700-million-euros-to-libya-in-the-last-six-years/;“Europe gave 700 million euros to Libya in the last six years”;2021-05-25;eufactcheck;;In April, Hanne Beirens, director of the Migration Policy Institute appeared on Terzake, a news show aired by the Flemish public broadcast organisation. As she and the television host discussed migrants drowning near the Libyan coast, Beirens mentioned that “Europe gave 700 million euros to Libya in the last six years.” That claim is mostly true. The claim Director Hanne Beirens used a fact sheet from the European Commission that combines all the funds Europe has used to support Libya. “In total, the EU has devoted around 700 million euros in support to Libya during 2014-2020 under various funding instruments, including the EU trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), the humanitarian assistance (ECHO) and the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP)”, the fact sheet mentions. Confusing figures The biggest funding tool according to the fact sheet is the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. It’s mainly used to support migration related issues in Libya. Libya is the country that benefits the most of the EUTF Africa. They claim that the fund mobilized 435 million euros so far. “More than half goes to protection and assistance to migrants, refugees and internally displaced people and one third goes to stabilization of Libyan municipalities.” According to the European Commission fact sheet, the remaining thirteen percent goes to integrated border management. The fact sheet from the European Commission only shows the operation of the EU Trust Fund for Africa. When we look into the numbers, we can see that the total amount of money of the Fund is 455 million instead of 435 million. Why do the numbers on the European Commission’s fact sheet not add up? We contacted the official institutions and they confirmed that 435 million is a wrong number.  On an official European Commission website, we found three other important funding streams. The first one is the European Neighbourhood Instrument, a bilateral corporation with Libya. This fund mainly focuses on the unstable political situation and has mobilized 98 million euros. The second funding system is ‘humanitarian assistance’. Libya struggles with humanitarian difficulties and the EU tries to help. The Union has allocated 75.3 million euros since 2011. The last fund is the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, Libya received 38.9 million euros from this funding stream. This number is based on the funding systems that ended, there are still ongoing funding streams. As you can see, it is very difficult to allocate the 700 million euros that went to Libya in the last six years. When we combine the four funding systems, we can conclude that Libya received 667.2 million euros since 2011 from Europe. Although we found a good overview of all the funding streams that flow to Libya, there is a lot of confusion and the claim that Director Beirens made does not add up. New figures appear In order to solve this problem, we contacted the European Commission. The Commission’s secretariat provided updated figures via e-mail. As we described before, the Emergency Fund for Africa contains 455 million euros. The figure corresponding to the European Neighbourhood Instrument is about 97.7 million euros. Libya received 55.3 million euros in humanitarian aid and the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace contains 90 million euros. With the new numbers, there is a total of 698.2 million euros. To be clear, these figures talk about the period between 2014 and 2020. Although the figures are very confusing in this case, Director Beirens did not spread false information. But she is not exactly right either. Firstly, the amount of money that Libya received from the European Union is around 700 million. The exact figure is 698.2 million euros, but the European institutions round up the figures when they communicate these numbers to a bigger audience. Secondly, when Beirens talked about the period in which Libya received the funds, she talked about the last six years. The fact sheet talks about the period between 2014 and 2020, which is indeed six years. However, she implied that the figures on the fact sheet included 2021, which is not true. This factcheck shows that a lot of the figures on official EU websites and fact sheets are not up to date or hard to understand. This seemingly contradicts the guidelines of the new European policy that mention more transparency and more evidence-based policymaking. With the start of the new Pact on Migration and Asylum in September 2020, the Commissioner of Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, repeated the new found transparency that will be used by the European Commission, according to Hanne Beirens in her response to a request for more information. Conclusion In conclusion, the claim made by Director of the of the Migration Policy Institute Hanne Beirens is mostly true. In the end, we found out that the figures are correct, but Beirens did not exactly talk about the right period of years.

In April 2021 the regional news cable channel N1 published an article on its web page in which the director of eUprava, Serbia’s official site for vaccination registration, Mr Mihailo Jovanović said: “It can be an Internet joke, but it also can be a dangerous online scam and provocation. So I am once again warning foreign citizens – no agency can bring you to Serbia for vaccination. Application procedure is either through the web page e-Uprava or through the contact centre”. We have found this claim to be mostly false. N1 article with the following headline: “Commercials for vaccine tourism in Serbia – a fraud, immunization only with a call” The reason why Serbians started vaccinating foreign citizens was primarily because the expiration date of AstraZeneca vaccine was the 1st of April and secondarily  at that time, quite a number of Serbians didn’t want to get vaccinated. The media hype began with statements that everyone is travelling to Serbia for vaccination. Regional media outlets blew this up and it was soon picked up by other European media. The most read Croatian and Bosnian news portals 24sata and Klix.ba included headlines such as “People from region massively rushed to get vaccinated in neighbouring Serbia” and “Serbia is massively vaccinating Bosnian citizens”. Associated Press and ABC News published that foreigners flocked to Serbia to get vaccinated and The Guardian picked up the statement from their president Aleksandar Vučić where he begged Serbians to get the vaccine. Soon Serbia became the hotspot for vaccination and affirmed itself as a “covid tourism” destination. Travel agencies offering different travel arrangements to Serbia became the focus of media’s attention, with most of these agencies operating either in Turkey or in Italy. While some media outlets just put the word out about their existence, some backed up Mr Jovanović’s statement saying that these offers might be a scam because one Italian agency – Viaggi Salvadori – offered Moderna vaccine which was not available in Serbia Two travel agencies, one destination In our research we found that two travel agencies kept coming up. They offered arrangements which included accommodation, trip and vaccination in Serbia. Those agencies were the already mentioned Italian travel agency Viaggi Salvadori and the Turkish travel agency EXP-ERT DMC. We tracked them down and found their brochures posted on social media. Viaggi Salvadori brochure Italian agency Viaggi Salvadori offered the travel package presented in the social media post. It listed the vaccinations and offered a local assistant on the arrival, stay in the hotel and facultative excursion, but with travel expenses excluded. Their owner Mr Sassateli Salvadori explained their offer for Corriere di Bologna: “If you for instance take a package for two people, for about 500 Euros, with added cost of the flight or the car, we guarantee help with filling the form in Cyrillic and choosing preferred vaccine, help with booking the flight or car rental, guide on arrival, four stars hotel in a double room as well as cultural visit in addition to the “visit” to the vaccination hub. Throughout the all four days”. EXP-ERT DMC brochure Turkish agency EXP-ERT DMC offered a travel package for 799 Euros. This covered immunization with two doses of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine, stay in a four-star hotel, two return plane tickets, transfer to the clinic and the Turkish-Serbian translator. On the 9th of April the Serbian embassy in Turkey said that they would no longer vaccinate foreigners until further notice. Soon after the original brochure of this arrangement and  the official website was no longer available. Instead, they posted the new publication on their Facebook page where they explained that the vaccination was a bonus service: “However, we must note again that our main responsibilities as EXP-ERT DMC are plane tickets and accommodation, whereas other listed services (such as arrangement of vaccination) are a bonus which we offer to our esteemed clients”. The emphasis is on the fact that they offer transportation and accommodation in Serbia – as any other tourist agency would – but they still list vaccination as a bonus service. Furthermore, the other part of Mr Jovanović’s statement, saying that the only way a person can get vaccinated in Serbia is either through registering on eUprava page or calling the contact centre, we have found to be false. One Croatian investigative journalism TV magazine called Potraga reported that Serbia still vaccinated 2600 foreigners even though they previously hadn’t registered anywhere. This means that people could come to Serbia – in this case people who bought travel arrangements – and they could get the vaccine with the help of local translators, and without having to register at eUprava’s website. A month after Mr Jovanovic’s claim, we tried to fill out a form on eUprava page to state our interest for vaccination in Serbia. It seems that right now it is impossible to apply as foreigner without a Serbian phone number. Even when we checked the option “Foreigners without stay in Serbia”, it is still impossible to submit the form without a Serbian phone number included in the personal details section. However, this can be easily solved with the help of, as the travel agencies call them, “local assistants”.     Another fact-checking website called Teyit did research about a similar claim and concluded that: “Even if countries do not openly admit the existence of this type of service, they try to have benefits from high demand because of non-existent law regulations and vaccine restrictions”.             Conclusion Therefore, even though it is true that no travel agency can directly ensure the vaccine, they do help out with the administration, offer the assistance and transfer foreigners to Serbia. Thus, we conclude that the statement made by Mihailo Jovanović is mostly false.

Figure 1: RT article 22nd of March with claim RT is publicly financed from the budget of the Russian Federation. It is formerly known as Russia Today. The article does not include any statistics or the source of Minister Grushko’s statement. We inquired the source from Russian State Department of European Cooperation. They responded that Minister Grushko’s statement is based on statistics by the Russian Federal Customs Service.  Figure 2: A row from statistics on Foreign trade of the Russian Federation translated to English Based on the Russian Federal Customs Service statistics Minister Grushko´s claim is true: The decrease in trade turnover is about 21% from 2019 to 2020. We wanted to find statistics from another source to verify the claim. Statistics are difficult to compare A problem we faced was the incompatibility of statistics. According to the Finnish Customs differences in statistics can be explained by multiple factors. These can be for example the differences in time frames of publishing information, exchange rates and errors in processing information or classification of merchandise. Different manners of collecting information causes differences in statistics. One question is how statistics have taken Brexit into account. Conclusive information about the external trade of the UK is difficult to source. This has an effect on interpreting statistics including the whole EU. A conclusion was reached by analyzing multiple sources We used the Eurostat-database when analyzing the amount of trade turnover decrease.The numbers for volume of trade in the year 2019 match Minister Grushko’s statement when converted to dollars. The Eurostat-statistic does not include the correct volume of trade for the year 2020. This is because of the changes to data-gathering caused by Brexit. This means that the statistic is missing information on UK trade from February to December of 2020 according to the Eurostat media support.  Figure 3: Statistics on exports between the EU (and the UK) and Russia. We used the following settings: Total products, reporter Russian Federation, and value in euros.   Figure 4: Statistics on imports between the EU (and the UK) and Russia. We used the following settings: Total products, reporter Russian Federation, and value in euros. To find an information source for the correct amount of trade of the UK in 2020 we used information by the European Commission Directorate-General for Trade. The numbers in this statistic are by the International Monetary Fund. This statistic matches Minister Grushko’s statement as in the volume of trade in the year 2020.  Figure 5: Statistics on Russia’s trading partners by the European Commission Directorate-General for Trade (Source: IMF). Here we found the numbers on UK trade in 2020 that match Minister Grushkos statement when exchanged to dollars. Conclusion In short, it´s true that the volume of trade between the EU and Russia has decreased 21% in 2020 according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. This was verified by Eurostat regarding the year 2019 and the statistic by the European Commission Directorate-General for Trade regarding the year 2020. Therefore the claim is true.

The claim turns out to be mostly false. Profusa Implantable BiosensorsThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense that develops emerging technologies for military use. The SCMP article states that the agency has “unveiled a chip that it said can detect signs of the new coronavirus in human bodies within minutes when it is implanted under the skin”. After we got in touch with DARPA, it turned out that the chip that the article is referring to is actually the Profusa Implantable Biosensor – a device, that could provide real-time data on how concentrations of different chemicals change in response to illness, injury, or activity in the daily life of the wearer.  Moreover, the agency emphasizes that the Profusa hydrogel is inert, does not have any electrical components, and is of similar material to a contact lens or corneal implant and for these reasons, it cannot be identified as a “chip”. Our correspondence with DARPA via email revealed also that the biosensor is not implanted under the skin, as stated in the article, but worn outside of the skin. These two erroneous assumptions are misleading and can be associated with the vastly disapproved human microchipping. By 2021, there are about 6000 Swedish who have been chipped. EUfactcheck concluded that this is true in a previous fact check. Many employees use them to get into their office buildings, as a gym pass, to buy food from vending machines and even instead of using train tickets. Ben Libberton,  a science communicator based in Stockholm, warns that by having a microchip implanted in your hand, you also give your data away: “The real issue is data handling, which will be an issue later on with how data is stored… if the data is not secure, someone can get your information and once it’s out there, it’s hard to get back.“ However, the question that arises from this new technology would be – is it possible to further develop the microchips to detect and hold information regarding COVID-19 or any future mutations? Does the implant detect COVID-19? The SCMP publication is citing Colonel Matthew Hepburn, who has been a programme manager at DARPA for six years (2013-2018) and has been managing the Profusa Implantable Biosensors project. Interestingly enough, Colonel Matthew Hepburn does not use the words “coronavirus”, “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” in any of the cited statements nor has he used them in the CBS News show 60 Minutes that is said to be the source of information. In addition, the answer that we received from DARPA points out that Profusa first received DARPA funding though a small grant in 2011, obviously well before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. However, the agency says that such a technology could conceivably help to detect the early onset of illness. Therefore, it is possible for the implant to detect COVID-19, but that was not the main purpose of the agency, while developing the technology, since the new coronavirus was not even existing at the early stages of development. Conclusion Taking into account all the data, the statement that the chip, developed by DARPA, can detect signs of COVID-19, when it is implanted under the skin, is mostly false. That claim was made by the CBS News show 60 minutes, then cited in the South China Morning Post. DARPA finds most of the former’s statements inaccurate.

Several European news media reported on this. According to the study data, this claim is mostly true. However, Finnish experts say that to analyze the claim more closely more information would be needed than Pfizer-Biontech provides in the press release. Pfizer-Biontech is a combination of two companies that have developed the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. Pfizer is in charge of the research, while Biontech is in charge of manufacturing the vaccine. The study on adolescents has not yet been published or peer reviewed. Since the press release, Pfizer has received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the vaccine.   A screenshot of Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reporting on the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine study on 12–15-year-olds. What does the 100 % efficacy rate mean?  The Pfizer-Biontech vaccine has been approved in the USA and in the EU for people aged 16 and over. The companies did not take on developing a new vaccination but agreed to test their adult-approved vaccine on children. In the study the vaccine was given to 1131 people without prior evidence of covid infection. None of the participants caught the Covid-19 virus. A placebo drug was given to a control group of 1129 people. Of the control group, 18 people got infected with Covid-19.  According to the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare’s chief physician Dr. Hanna Nohynek, 100 % efficacy rate could mean several things: complete protection against either a) catching the virus, b) an illness that might lead to hospitalization or c) death. Therefore, it is important to specify what endpoints were used in measuring the efficacy – that is to say, what the goal of the study was. Dr. Nohynek also pointed out that it is difficult to compare the outcomes of vaccine studies without sufficient data on the premises, population studied and epidemiological situations where the studies were carried out, as the study set ups vary. Furthermore, Dr. Ilkka Seppä, physician coordinator of Tampere University’s Vaccine Research Center noted that fully developed vaccines rarely have an efficacy rate of 100 %. On the media responsibility It seems that the press release is aimed at investors and should be viewed from this particular perspective. The press release refers to Nasdaq information on the companies’ stock value and lists contact information of the companies’ investor relations staff, rather than their vaccine experts. The press release was quoted in news around Europe immediately after its release. Noticeable was that many news medias did not provide a background on the topic.   Conclusion It is true that the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine offers a protection against Covid-19 for 12–15-year-olds in this stage of development, but the claim of 100 % effectiveness is relative. According to the chief physician of the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, Dr. Hanna Nohynek, we need specific information on the goals of each study to be able to evaluate the study results.

This deal aims to make the EU completely climate neutral by the year 2050. To reach this goal, the president proposes the European Climate Law to turn the political commitment into a legal obligation upon EU members. ID’s tweet accusing Ursula von der Leyen of green deal hypocrisy. Screenshot by Charlotte Ariën   Identity and democracy group (ID) include nationalist parties from across Europe that form one of the largest right-winged groups in the European Parliament. According to EU affairs, of the 705 available seats, ID takes up 76, making them the fourth largest group in the European Parliament. Air-taxi budget  ID did not respond to the question of what their claim was based on. However, a public tender document containing the budget for ‘air-taxi’ flights, or private jets, for senior EU commissioners shows an increase in budget from EUR 7.14 million to EUR 10.71 million. That is a 50% increase in budget in the past five years: “The initial contract was awarded for a total amount covering the entire duration of the contract. However, the analysis of expenditure during the period already elapsed has led to the conclusion that this threshold will not be suffice to cover the needs of the European institutions until the expiry date of the contract, i.e. 30.4.2021.” ‘Air-taxi’ flights, however, are not only used by the President and the European Commission. According to the document on the EU’s tenders database, “chartered jet aeroplane services are also used for the European Parliament Presidency, for the President of the European Council, for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and any accompanying persons, mostly in the European Union.”  The original contract by the EU stated that the service provider would use the following six types of aircraft used for air-taxi transport services:    Very light jet: standard flight: 4 passengers, flight without overnight stop (Brussels–Strasbourg–Brussels);  Light jet: standard flight: 7 passengers, flight with one overnight stop (Brussels–Strasbourg–Stuttgart/Stuttgart–Liège–Brussels)  Midsize jet: standard flight: 9 passengers, flight with three overnight stops (Brussels–Berlin–Riyadh/Riyadh–Doha/Doha–Abu Dhabi/Abu Dhabi–Brussels)  Super midsize jet: standard flight: 13 passengers, flight with one overnight stop (Brussels–Tokyo/Tokyo–Strasbourg–Brussels)  Regional jet: standard flight: 50 passengers, flight without overnight stop Brussels–Riga–Brussels) Large jet: standard flight: 100 passengers, flight with one overnight stop (Brussels–Antalya/Antalya–Brussels)  The same document estimated that there would be about 871 total flight hours throughout the five-year contract. The flight hours were divided into the following categories:   81 hours for aeroplane category ‘very light jet’; 311 hours for aeroplane category ‘light jet’; 310 hours for aeroplane category ‘midsize jet’; 99 hours for aeroplane category ‘super-midsize jet’; 60 hours for aeroplane category ‘regional jet’; 10 hours for aeroplane category ‘large jet’.  These predicted hour allocations were not enough, forcing the EU to increase their budget by nearly EUR 3.5 million.  The predicted hours show that the majority of chartered jet aeroplanes are used for missions outside of Europe, classifying them as “worldwide” missions. However, there has been no evidence proving which flights the President of the Commission has taken or will take in the future.  The President’s calendar  On the EU website, missions and meetings of President Ursula von der Leyen are summarised on her transparency page. These are monthly and provide travel and accommodation costs (most of the time) but not means of transportation used per mission. However, on her calendar page, she has many more international meetings than stated on the official ‘meetings page’, but no details regarding means of transportation or costs are provided. When contacting her cabinet, it was assured that all of the information regarding her travel arrangements could be found here. Her cabinet did not share specific flight details concerning Ursula von der Leyen’s international mission. Conclusion  Uncheckable: Currently, the statement made by ID can neither be confirmed nor denied. It can be confirmed that the EU has needed to increase their budget for private jet use. With the growth of private jet services, the main European political institutions increase their carbon footprint whilst implementing CO2 restrictions on member states. However, due to a lack of information concerning Von der Leyen’s travel arrangements, it cannot be confirmed that she personally takes a private jet for her (worldwide) missions.

The claim turns out to be mostly true.                                                             While the statements are correct, there are other important facts that are missing from the publication and that should be considered as well. Bloomberg does not state their primary sources, nor are the facts substantiated. Expert opinions are sought to comment on the incident. Therefore, this factcheck examines the origin and authenticity of the claims. The wind is one of the reasons for the blockage There are many factors for the blockage, not only strong winds and sandstorms. We are given the primary source, which is the Suez Canal Authority, that said: “a lack of visibility in adverse weather led to the ship losing control and drifting”. However, the link sends us to a page that does not exist. Nevertheless, we researched their official website for similar publications. Unfortunately, nothing about the statement was shared there. In addition, we noticed that very little information related to Ever Given was published on the site. The main highlight is how the authority managed to bring the accident to a positive end. When deciding the reason for the blockage, there are a couple of more complex operations happening. We have the logistics of how the enormous boats are functioning in pretty slim and confined dimensions. Also, certain decisions and actions have a huge impact on the boat, leading to the end situation. In addition, there is always a potential risk of human error. It is worth mentioning that there are many intriguing effects in the water, we have the bank effect ending with the spinning result. Therefore, the statement that the winds and sandstorms are the reason for the blockage is partially true, they could have contributed to that, however, they cannot be given as the definite reason. We investigated German sources as well. Björn Blaschke, head of the ARD radio studio in Cairo, which is part of Germany’s regional public-service broadcasters, states that there was a power failure onboard, followed by a storm and poor visibility that probably threw the ship off course, according to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority. This once again cannot be checked, as the primary source is inaccessible. Beyond everything, we have to note that in the article it is clearly said that this statement is only based on the initial investigation suggestions. So we cannot tell that the statement is misleading, however we need more information on the matter in order to paint the whole picture. $10 Billion of global trade is lost as a result The award-winning journalist Richard Meade from the shipping industry’s most sophisticated source of online news, analysis and insights – Lloyd’s List, is the first one to state that the blockage of the Suez Canal would cost around $10 billion worth of global trade. That equates to $400 million and 3.3 million tons of cargo an hour, or $6.7 million a minute. Few days after the initial report, Bloomberg stated “A Desert Wind Blew $10 Billion of Global Trade Off Course”. While it is true, Bloomberg does not state their primary source, nor are the facts justified. The reader can easily be misled into thinking that this is in fact the value of the goods transported on the Ever Given itself. Furthermore, we should also consider other facts when deciding what impact the blockage would have on the economy. For example, The Suez Canal Authority chief Osama Rabie estimated the Canal’s revenues were taking a $14m-$15m hit for each day of the blockage. Later on, Rabie also stated that the SCA would insist on further compensation for reputational damage and for successfully salvaging the ship. To consider other viewpoints, we turned to German experts. According to Allianz SE, a German multinational financial services company, each day of immobilization could cost global trade $6-10 billion. Both sources, Allianz SE and Lloyd’s List, give us a key detail that $10 billion is the loss per day, while in Bloomberg it seems like an overall loss. Allianz SE also highlights the important role of the Suez Canal in the trade of goods between Europe and Asia, saying that the gateway has welcomed over 19,000 ships in 2019, or 1.25 billion tons of cargo. As a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports that the cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise.Even though it sounds like a metaphor, the winds really did “blow” $10 billion of global trade. While it is true that the wind is a reason for the blockage, it is not the only one to weigh on the decision that the statement in Bloomberg is mostly true. Taking the effects from certain decisions and actions into consideration, as well as the bank effect ending with the spinning result, a blockage has been formed. Thus, no ships could navigate through the Suez Canal, which leads to delays and this is the reason for the loss of global trade. However, when deciding what impact the blockage would have on the economy we also have other factors to consider, and that contributes to the conclusion of the claim is mostly true. Conclusion In short, the cause for the blockage of the Suez Canal is complex, as well as the effects from it. The wind is partly to blame but it is not the ultimate reason. The impact it had on global trade is enormous, but it is yet to be determined how much the sum will grow as lawsuits arise. Therefore, the claim is mostly true.

In it, Mark Akkerman of NGO ‘Stop Arms Trade’ claimed that companies like Airbus and Leonardo, who are supplying weapons to the Middle East, work with Frontex to stop refugees at the European borders. Akkerman’s research detailed how much companies earn from exporting arms to the Middle East. Next to the United States, EU countries are the main source of arms for the Middle East. For example, between 2005 and 2014 EU countries earned about 82 million euros on arms export licenses. EU grants The websites from Airbus, aerospace industry, and Leonardo, specialized in security technology, also specify that the companies sell military aircrafts and military technology to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Oman. And Saudi Arabia is directly involved in conflicts in the Middle East. Those same companies work with Frontex, the European agency that actively works to secure borders. For example, the arms suppliers were paid about 200,000 euros to send out “surveillance drones”, including over the Mediterranean, to spot refugees. This cooperation was openly proclaimed on the websites of Airbus and Leonardo. Airbus is also experiencing many financial benefits from EU grants around border surveillance research projects. The funding for the projects in which Airbus is actively participating is calculated to be close to 10 million euros. Thus, these kinds of fundings are also a major source of income for aerospace, defence and security companies like Leonardo S.p.A and Thales. Conclusion As the companies themselves put stories and numbers on their webistes about their export of weaponry to the Middle East and their involvement in the surveillance of the EU borders, everything indicates that the statement is correct.

The statement is uncheckable. The term “democratic representations” sounds official. The Oxford Dictionary’s definition for the word representation is: “formal statements made to an authority, especially so as to communicate an opinion or register a protest.” In other words, Mr. Eustice was saying there is an official way to make a representation by the EU member states for the European Commission, but the Commission systemically ignores some of the representations. For us it seems that Mr. Eustice´s claim is connected to the tensed trade relations between the EU and the UK. We still thought it was definite enough to fact check.  Graphics by Elina Janhunen/Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences But how the decision making in the EU works is not quite that simple. We contacted several people working for the EU and none of them could give a direct answer for what kind of representation Mr. Eustice could be talking about. Pekka Nurminen, Head of Unit in the European Parliament, wrote into an e-mail: “I think that [Mr. Eustice’s] choice of words is intentionally misleading — it is not possible [for Mr. Eustice] to refer to anything concrete, as it would expose it to so called fact checking.” We also asked for Mr. Eustice´s own input to what he might have meant with the claim. We received an automate replied e-mail that promised an answer within fifteen working days. We still haven’t got a reply, although the time period expired. The EU Legislative Procedure The European Commission holds a great influence on decision-making in the union, as it has the initiative to prepare and propose legislation. The European Parliament (elected by EU citizens) and the Council (consisting of ministers from member state governments) can make further amendments to the proposals and have the final authority to pass the laws. But how does the Commission decide which legislation to pursue? This process doesn’t seem transparent. According to the European Commission Press Office in Finland there are many professional lobbyists working in Brussels, and they all promote their interests. EU citizens have the right to gather and give their own proposals through the European Citizen’s Initiative. There are also other possible parties that can make suggestions for the Commission, for example European Central Bank. Anyhow, European Commission´s duty is to consider the overall interest of the European Union when proposing new legislation. Conclusion: Uncheckable In this light, the claim of the European Commission ignoring “democratic representations” is uncheckable. It is simply not possible to define what kind of representations Mr. Eustice meant. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

The claim appears to be mostly true. According to Reuters the article is based on WHO’s press release titled “Slow vaccine roll out prolonging pandemic” that was published on 31.3.2021. The percentages shown in the article are confirmed by the statement. However, WHO does not specify which area the statement is referring to. Reuters communications manager Joel Ivory-Harte confirmed via email that by Europe the article means EU.  Figure 1: A screenshot from Reuters 1.4.2021 article about WHO’s 31.3.2021 published statement.  What is meant by Europe? Because there is no full certainty about what WHO meant with European region we made three different scenarios. Our World in Data is a publication with a daily updated global dataset. Their data can be used for comparison. Hedinn Halldorsson, WHO’s communications officer, confirmed that the data can be found in WHO Europe Covid-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor. Some data had been updated after the statement in some countries. This can affect the numbers and raise differences between the statement and our calculations.   Figure 2: Comparison showing Europe’s vaccination data, including the UK.  In this scenario, regarding Europe, the difference between the Kluge’s statement (10 %) and statistics (12,21 %) is 2,21 percentage points. In numbers it means about 16,5 million people. Reuters article wrote specifically about the situation in the EU. These numbers are the closest when comparing to Dr. Kluge’s statement.   Figure 3: Comparison showing the European Union vaccination data.  There is about one percentage point’s difference between WHO’s statement and Europe Covid-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor. It means about 4.47 million people.   Figure 4: Comparison showing WHO’s European region, which includes countries outside of Europe like Israel and Turkey.  This last calculation was based on this list of countries. There is a 1,17 percentage point’s difference between WHO’s statement and Europe Covid-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor. It means about 9.28 million people.  Conclusion  In stating that 10% of European region population has had one vaccine dose and 4% full course (in beginning of April) Dr. Kluge is close to correct. According to our research the claim is mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

69;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-madrid-is-among-the-european-cities-with-the-highest-number-of-deaths-per-million-inhabitants/;“Madrid is among the European cities with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants”;2021-05-05;eufactcheck;;"The leader of Podemos party, Pablo Iglesias, stated during a televised electoral debate on 21 April that, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the community of “Madrid is among the European cities with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants (2,207) more than London, Paris, Rome or Berlin”. The claim turns out to be true.  The coronavirus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, spread rapidly across Europe in early 2020, forcing different governments to adopt severe measures such as lockdowns that affected around 250 million people. Italy became the first country in the European Union to suffer the ravages of the pandemic and quickly began to register high rates of infections and mortality that soon spread to other European countries. In a similar vein to other European countries, the coronavirus pandemic began to hit Spain in March 2020. As a result, the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of alarm throughout the Spanish territory on 14 March, thus limiting mobility and establishing other restrictions to control the spread of the virus. In October, the government granted some freedom to the different regional governments of the country to implement their own measures, which generated discrepancies at the political level between the different parties and regions of the country. On 10 March 2021, the president of the Community of Madrid and member of the conservative Popular Party (PP), Isabel Díaz Ayuso, called snap elections for the capital’s regional government on 4 May. The contest led Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos, a far-left party, to resign as vice minister of Spain to run for election as a candidate himself. The electoral campaign began on April 18. The campaign has mainly focused on the way in which Díaz Ayuso has handled the coronavirus pandemic in Madrid, the region of Spain that has imposed the fewest restrictions despite having high rates of infections and mortality among its population. The first electoral debate between the candidates to preside over the Madrid government was held on 21 April. It was produced by Madrid’s public television Telemadrid and broadcast also by Spanish public television (TVE) and the private channel La Sexta. During the debate, the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, referred to the deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic in Madrid and claimed that “Madrid is among the European cities with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants, 2207, more than London, Paris, Rome or Berlin”.   Screenshot of Pablo Iglesias during the electoral debate Is Madrid at the same level of mortality as other European capitals? On 10 April, journalist Pepo Jiménez, based on data from Statista, compared the number of deaths per million inhabitants of Madrid with other European capitals such as London, Paris / Ile de France, Rome / Lazio and Berlin. Data provided by Jiménez in Twitter revealed that Madrid presented 2,207 deaths per million inhabitants.   Screenshot of Pepo Jiménez tweet To provide an updated account of Iglesias’ statement, the most recent data provided by Statista on April 22 was also reviewed. According to data, in Madrid, as of April, 14,889 people have died from complications derived from the COVID-19 disease, thus positioning Madrid as the Spanish community with the highest number of deaths. Considering that the population of the Community of Madrid is 6,642,000 people, then the mortality rate per million inhabitants is 2,241. To obtain this figure, the number of deaths has been divided by the population and multiplied by one thousand.   Screenshot of Statista showing number of deaths related to COVID-19 in Spain as of April 20, 2021, by autonomous community. Continuing with the rest of the European capitals that Iglesias mentioned in his statement and applying the same mathematical formula, it was found that in London the number of deaths per million inhabitants is 1,780; in the Rome / Lazio region it is 1,277; in Paris / Ile de France it is 1,485; and finally, in Berlin it is 875. A comparison between the number of deaths per million inhabitants in those European capitals is presented in this graphic.      Former official of the World Health Organization, Daniel López-Acuña has been contacted to explain why in Madrid the number of deaths is greater than in other European capitals. According to López-Acuña, “the penetration of the virus in Madrid has been greater than in other European cities and in other Spanish regions largely due to the lack of sufficiently thorough restrictions to mobility and social interaction”. As noted by the interviewee, a study conducted by the Institute Carlos III in conjunction with the different regional governments has determined that when compared to the rest of the Spanish regions, the mortality of Madrid “ranks among the highest, and is close to 8 times higher than the one observed in Canary Islands for example”. Another factor contributing to the higher mortality rates in Madrid “could be the very high rate of deaths occurring among the population resident in nursing homes”. As stressed by López-Acuña, “older people had greater severity and mortality than other groups of the population, were not adequately and timely refer to hospitals for appropriate care and unfortunately experienced very high lethality”. Considering these factors, “Madrid has contributed not only with the largest absolute number of deaths to the total of people who passed away because of COVID-19 in Spain but, once measured by population size and expressed in mortality rates, it shows one of the highest mortality rates in the country and among European capitals”. As noted by López-Acuña, in Madrid “mortality is scandalously high, current incidence rates are among the highest in Spain and the current saturation of Intensive Care Units is also tremendously high”. Conclusion As the interviewed expert Daniel López-Acuña mentioned, it is always better to do a deep analysis by standardizing the age groups when trying to compare between different cities or countries. That being said, statistical data observed in this fact check and the expert’s vision conclude that the data in Madrid are tremendously negative and therefore it can be said that Madrid is one of the European capitals with the worst mortality rates. Thus, we conclude that the statement made by Pablo Iglesias during the electoral debate is true.    RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Pilar Suárez López, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ES Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

70;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-bulgaria-has-stopped-using-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/;Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine;2021-04-27;eufactcheck;;This factcheck examines the origin and authenticity of the statement “Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine”, made in an AlJazeera article. It turns out that the claim is TRUE.This topic is of extremely high importance for the health situation in Europe but more so for Bulgaria – the reactions towards the introduction of vaccines in Bulgaria were polarized and the society reacted strongly both for and against. That is why it is important to check this decision made by the government which impacts the health of the whole community. The validation of this information was necessary because contradictory messages appeared in the media space here. Facts first! Bulgaria is among the countries in the European Union, received a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine, which has undergone additional checks. Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, joining a small number of European countries that have halted its use after reports that some recipients developed serious blood clots. There were reports of roughly 37 cases of blood clots occurring after vaccination in many European countries and a few of them are fatal. On the 12th of March Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Boyko Borisov stated that the use of the vaccine in Bulgaria would also be paused “until all doubts are dispelled and as long as the experts do not give guarantees that it does not pose a risk to the people, and while in a written opinion the European Medicine Agency (EMA) dismissed any doubts and to its safety. “ In this article from the 12th of March 2021 it is stated “Bulgaria latest to halt AstraZeneca vaccine”. The claim is factual, based on official information and its subject is clearly defined as the temporary halt of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Bulgaria. The author of the claim is the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borissov and his claim was based on a primairy source, refered to in the article.  A second expert, the Minister of Health Kostadin Angelov confirms the claim. “ In Bulgaria we also have a fatal outcome, but we have no proof that is due to it.”, said the Minister of Health Kostadin Angelov. Moreover, according to the Brussels Times, the European Medicines Agency EMA is still investigating second side effect of AstraZeneca vaccine. What happens in the field? But what is the story behind the official information and what happens in the hospitals? According to a phone interview with Maria Spasova  – a PR of Maichin Dom (Mothers’ home)–  they stopped using AstraZeneca as soon as a RZI  (Regional Health Inspectorate) official rule was handed to all hospitals in Bulgaria and a regulation was issued by the Ministry of Health. This was on the same day as the statement was made.  The patients who had their first dose of AstraZeneca given already were instructed to wait until the vaccine is put in use again. Mothers’ home restarted the vaccine usage after the second statement by Ministry of Health on March 18, which stated that the vaccination with AstraZeneca should be resumed the next day. The Military Academy accepted people for second dosage even after the first official announcement, according to their Facebook post on March 12.  On March 19 their Facebook page confirms the official statement by the government to resume all vaccination with AstraZeneca.  University Multi-profile Hospital for Active Treatment and Emergency Medicine Pirogov  has the same policy as Maichin Dom and resumed vaccination after the second government statement, according to their Facebook page.  Military Medical Academy, photo by Viktoria Kostova Alexandrovska University Hospital reacts the same way and even shares two interviews on the topic of resuming the vaccination on March 19. Conclusion Bulgaria was one of the first countries to halt the usage of AstraZeneca. Bulgarian citizens however weren’t sure whether this statement of the government was true or some immature decision due to insufficient arguments. Factchecking showed that the hospitals were instructed to stop vaccination on 12 March until vaccine was put back into use on 19 March 2021. Three of leading and biggest hospitals in Bulgaria – Pirogov, Alexandrovska and Military Medical Academy, where patients seek information’s updates every day, confirmed this policy.  The usage of AstraZeneca has been restarted by the order of Ministry of Health , but the reasons are not entirely clear, as an interview with  Maichin Dome proved.  The effect of the confusion was that Bulgarians now prefer to be vaccinated by Moderna and Pfizer- BioNTech. The scientific research about the potential helath risk of the AstraZeneca vaccin is ongoing and to early to be factchecked. We found the statement made in the media to be true.

The discussion of this issue did take place at the first online summit of EU leaders on January 21, 2021. According to Gazeta.ru, the issue of certification was put forward by the leaders of Greece and Spain. The initiative was supported by the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. According to Gazeta.ru, she stated that: “Having a vaccination certificate is a medical requirement. Therefore, I welcome the initiative of the Greek Prime Minister for mutually recognized vaccination certificates. Whatever the decision, whether it gives priority or access to certain goods, is a political and legal decision that should be discussed at the European level”.  The Independent also reports on the unity reached at the EU virtual summit and quotes Angela Merkel. Speaking after a virtual EU summit, the German chancellor said: “Everyone agreed that we need a digital vaccination certificate.”  But at the same article Independent notes, that “Southern European countries dependent on tourism, such as Greece and Spain, support such a system, but their northern EU partners have expressed doubt about whether the certificates would work.”  Euronews reports that Belgium and Germany maintain restrictions on international travel, drawing criticism from the European Commission.  DW was closer to Euronews in reflecting the point of view of Germany and France, reporting that  “France and Germany have shown more reluctance, with officials saying it would create de facto vaccination obligation and could prove discriminatory”. According to Gazeta.ru,  the initiative also was not supported by representatives of Romania (“I don’t think it’s a good idea. There should be a vaccination passport, but for medical issues, not for travel,” said Romanian President Klaus Iohannis).  France also opposed passports. “This is a discussion that is unnecessary. <…> We very much disapprove of such an idea”, said French Minister for European Affairs Clement Bon.  A very important decision concerning the vaccine certificates was made on March 21, 2021, when the European Commission has proposed to create a Digital Green Certificate, which is supposed to facilitate free movement inside the EU. Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: “With the Digital Green Certificate, we are taking a European approach to ensure EU citizens and their family members can travel safely and with minimum restrictions this summer. The Digital Green Certificate will not be a pre-condition to free movement and it will not discriminate in any way. A common EU-approach will not only help us to gradually restore free movement within the EU and avoid fragmentation. It is also a chance to influence global standards and lead by example based on our European values like data protection.” The Commission also adopted a complementary proposal to ensure that the Digital Green Certificate is also issued to non-EU nationals who reside in Member States or Schengen Associated States and to visitors who have the right to travel to other Member States.  Separate proposals to cover citizens and non-EU citizens are necessary for legal reasons; there is no difference in treatment of citizens and eligible non-EU citizens for the purpose of the certificates. In order to enact this decision, Member States must swiftly implement the trust framework and technical standards. According to the press release given by the European Commission the EU aims to complete these steps “in the coming months”. Conclusion Thus, we can conclude that the decision to use vaccination passports in EU is a controversial issue and now we can only speculate on whether the EU is really going to adopt vaccination certificates. It is however evident that lots of European politicians have a strong intention to do so, as the European Commission has officially begun taking steps towards that goal.

The politician does not cite any source to support her statement. Her claim is uncheckable. Laura Sachslehner making her claim during a speech in Vienna’s City Parliament on March 25th, 2021 Laura Sachslehner’s statement leaves the impression that Viennese police officers are under constant threat by citizens. But is it true that police officers are attacked on a daily basis?  When asked for a corresponding statistic by the Federal Ministry of the Interior to which the Austrian police forces are subordinate, no serious statement can be made in this regard, according to Patrick Maierhofer, departmental spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior: “Since in the subjective perception of individual persons, a verbal assault on police officers can already be considered an assault, while others only consider a physical assault with injury to be an assault – no serious statement can be made on their request. […] In this respect, there are no collected statistics for this.“ Maierhofer refers to possible statistics collected by the Vienna Provincial Police Directorate. After enquiring at the Police Department of Vienna, press spokeswoman Barbara Gass stated that it was not possible to give a general answer to whether attacks on the police are a daily occurrence in Vienna. She however provided the following statistics on the matter: “In 2019, we had to record 389 police officers injured by external force, in 2020 392. This year, there have been 92 (01.01.2021 – to date) injured officers so far.“ Judging by these numbers, one could come to the conclusion that police officers are indeed attacked on a daily basis. Yet, a simple division (number of attacks / number of days) does not take into consideration mass events such as demonstrations or football games. Due to the number of participants in such events, the chance of attacks and/or injuries of police offices rises.  Hence, we wanted to know if there are more details on the provided numbers and circumstances. However, follow-up-questions were not answered by the Department on the grounds of an „enormous administrative burden”.  Also, Laura Sachslehner did not want to comment on the basis of which sources she had used when making her statement. All our enquiries remained unanswered. Conclusion At this point, the statement cannot be confirmed or refuted. Since the term “attack“ can be understood in a very broad sense and Ms. Sachslehner did not respond to enquiries to disclose the source, we classify the statement as uncheckable.

In a press release they stated according to the United Nations (UN) women’s organization UN Women the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in domestic violence against women worldwide. This statement is uncheckable. The claim in the original context on the website of UN Women (see third paragraph, second sentence). Source: UN Women.  Brot für die Welt is a German aid organization of the Protestant Church. As a global development agency, the organization is active in more than 90 countries around the globe. In cooperation with local partners, they help poor and marginalized people to improve their living situation on their own. They currently support more than 1,500 projects worldwide focusing on education and health, respect for human rights and equality between men and women.  Since the outbreak of the respiratory disease Covid-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March, Brot für die Welt has released six-figure project funds for Covid-19 projects. According to Cornelia Füllkrug-Weitzel, President of Brot für die Welt, the dangers posed by Covid-19 are especially severe for those people who are poorly protected. The last category includes women who experience domestic violence in their own home. Due to lockdowns and curfews imposed as a measure to contain the Covid-19 virus, people are spending most of their time at home. “Even in normal times, gender-based violence against women is alarming. The fact that many men are venting their frustration about the restrictions resulting from the pandemic on their wives reveals, as if under a magnifying glass, violence against women as a much more fundamental pandemic: the low reputation and low status of women in most societies”, says Füllkrug-Weitzel. UN Women data on domestic violence against women during the Covid-19 pandemic  In the press release, Brot für die Welt refers to information from the United Nations (UN) women’s organization UN Women, according to which domestic violence is increasing in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. On the website of UN Women we found various documents with facts and figures on domestic violence against women during the pandemic. In SPOTLIGHT ON GENDER, COVID-19 AND THE SDGS, a joint product of UN Women and the Gender and COVID-19 Working Group, you can read that globally, it is estimated that 243 million women and girls aged 15-49 have been subjected to sexual and/or physical violence perpetrated by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. A few countries are mentioned as examples reporting an increase in violence against women. In Lebanon and Malaysia calls to domestic violence helplines doubled in March 2020 compared to March 2019, and increased in France by 32 percent (this is also reported by a second source, the German national daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung). Notably, the ﬁgures reﬂect reporting, not incidence, and it has long been known that domestic violence is grossly underreported. According to the UN Women publication GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19, in some countries abuse reports and calls to hotlines are decreasing as women are unable to leave home or access help online or via telephone. Accordingly, the figures are likely to reflect only the worst cases. It is questionable to what extent this conclusion is justified, as they assume that the numbers have declined due to the fact that they did not call because the partner is present, but it could also be that simply nothing happened. The following figure shows some numbers on how the violence against women has increased during the pandemic. Numbers on violence against women and girls during the Covid-19 pandemic.Source: United Nations. Policy Brief:The Impact of COVID-19 on Women. The fact that the UN speaks of “worldwide” is problematic although data may be available for all countries. It is questionable whether the transmitted data is correct (see “domestic violence is grossly underreported”). In this case, sorting by continents would have been more sensible and clearer. In general, we did not have access to all original data from all countries. Reasons why women and girls become victims Violence against women and girls during the Covid-19 pandemic increases as security, health and financial stress heighten tensions, which are exacerbated by lockdown measures. The need to isolate themselves may discourage women from leaving violent homes as they fear for their health or that of their children. Due to the increased work in their own home, it is not possible to take refuge in work. At the same time, the men have no change whatsoever. They cannot meet with their friends and may take out their frustration on women. The women cannot meet anyone either and therefore have no reference person to talk to. Contacting experts For further information, we have contacted the United Nations and Brot für die Welt to confirm the accuracy of the data. Unfortunately, we have not received any feedback so far. We also contacted pro familia, a Germany-wide association of counselling centers that offers medical, psychological, psychosocial and family law advice on issues such as sexuality, partnership, separation and divorce. The expert from pro familia, Regine Wlassitschau, referred to the website of the European umbrella organization of pro familia and to the article “The Corona crisis as a cause of domestic violence?” by Marius Riebel, author of the association magazine of pro familia. Riebel is a research assistant at the Chair for Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, Criminology, Juvenile Criminal Law and Prison Law at the University of Leipzig. According to Riebel, the picture of the situation is ambiguous, as changes occur when looking at case numbers for a period during the Covid-19 restrictions. Internationally, the reports of increasing numbers prevail. The numbers underline the link between Covid-19 restrictions and the occurrence of domestic violence against women. There are also isolated reports to the contrary. However, Riebel also points out that an important corrective to the restrictive criminal reporting behavior is contact with third parties. This important social control was almost completely eliminated, especially at the beginning of the contact restrictions. The proportion of self-reporters has fallen sharply due to the difficult situation shown and could create a gap in the current case numbers. An increase in the case numbers could become visible with a delay as soon as the contact restrictions are lifted. Then those affected are no longer exposed to the violent partner and social corrective measures can fully take place again. Conclusion Brot für die Welt claims that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in domestic violence against women worldwide. Ultimately, due to the lack of feedback, we did not manage to get confirmation from the United Nations that the data was accurate. Even though it is theoretically possible to find data about women violence worldwide, we are unable to validate the numbers from every country. “Worldwide” implies that every country in the world has to be considered. The geography should have been better defined in the claim and limited to specific countries. For this reason, we believe that this claim should be considered uncheckable.

Also, she claims that the vaccine is better available for the so-called elite than for other people. These claims appear to be not completely true. On February 3rd of 2021, the Dutch news platform ‘EenVandaag’ published an article about a possible export of 100 million doses of the Russian corona vaccine Sputnik-V to Europe. In this article, Russia analyst Helga Salemon of the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies is asked about her opinion on this topic. Mrs. Salemon claims that the corona vaccine is only available in 5 of the 85 regions in total of the Russian Federation. Furthermore, she says: “It is readily available for the elite, much more difficult for the rest”.  Figure 1: Article ‘EenVandaag’ with claim Salemon (In Dutch) EenVandaag doesn’t mention the source of Salemon’s information. After having contacted Mrs.Salemon in person, it appears that she based her information on the Russian news site ‘The New Times’ (Novoye Vremya). The New Times in turn is referring to the Russian research company St. Petersburg Politics Foundation. While Salemon claims that the vaccine is only available in 5 of 85 regions in the Russian Federation, this appears to be not the whole story. The claim gives the impression that the vaccine is unavailable in the other regions of Russia. However, the availability in 5 regions refers to a high possibility of mass vaccinations. Beside those mass vaccinations, there are still 30 regions in Russia where the vaccine is available to a lower extent, as can be seen in figure 2. Figure 2: Availabilty of vaccine according to St. Petersburg Politics Foundation Elite Furthermore, Mrs. Salemon claims that the vaccine would be available in a higher extent for a so-called elite. This term can be described as vague, as it is not clear what is meant with this term. According to the research of the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, the vaccine is also available for teachers, doctors and social workers in a couple of regions where there is access to the vaccine to a certain extent. It is not obvious from the research that a so-called ‘elite’ would have better access to the vaccine, as can be seen in figure 3. Figure 3: Vaccination of different workforces Russia expert Joris van Bladel, who in the past worked as an advisor for the safity commission of the Austrian ministry of Safety and Sport with special focus on Russian affairs, confirms the conclusion of this factcheck. Salemon’s claim about the availability of the Sputnik-V vaccine is largely untrue, as she is only describing the above average availability of the vaccine in 5 out of 85 regions of the Russian Federation. Conclusion In stating that the vaccine would only be available in 5 out of 85 regions in the Russian Federation, Mrs. Salemon is not making enough adjustments as it appears to be available in 35 regions to a more or less extent according to the primary source, the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation. Beside this conclusion, there cannot be found any evidence from the primary source that a so-called ‘elite’ would have better access to the vaccine. Furthermore, her initial claim which is given in the article of ‘EenVandaag’ is based on a Russian article instead of the primary source itself. According to this factual analysis, the conclusion of this factcheck is ‘mostly false’. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

The release is chronologically connected to the massive arrival of irregular migrants to the Canary Islands, where the regional authorities were not able to attend them correctly because of resource insufficiency. The claim turns out to be mostly false.  VOX is a Spanish far-right political party founded in 2013 and currently led by Santiago Abascal, a former member of the liberal-conservative People’s Party (Partido Popular). The political formation holds 52 seats in the Spanish lower chamber and has helped elect regional leaders from the People’s Party. Abascal’s party has earned a voice, especially since the last Spanish election in 2019, in which the alt-right movement entered the Spanish parliament for the first time since the democratic transition. The party is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists, which includes other far-right members such as the Polish Law and Justice, the Bulgarian National Movement and the Italian Brothers of Italy.   A screenshot from VOX’s claim published on its website VOX is well known for its anti-irregular immigration policies, which include the immediate deportation of all irregular migrants to their country of origin, the expulsion of any immigrant faulty of committing a crime, and the illegalization of non-profit organizations thought to be in collaboration with human trafficking-related “mafias”. This last part includes Open Arms, a non-profit which voluntarily rescues immigrant boats while they are crossing the Mediterranean and brings them back to safe grounds. VOX sued the organization in 2019 for infringement of the Spanish maritime law and collaboration with human trafficking.  The evolution of the Mediterranean migrant situation in Spain Since 2016, the arrival of irregular migrants in Spain through land and sea has not followed a clear trend. There have been two peaks. The first one, from April 2018 to January 2019, happened during the change of Government in Spain. The People’s Party (PP) lost control of the executive branch in June to a coalition made by PSOE (center-left) and Podemos (left) led by prime minister Pedro Sánchez.  However, the number of migrants entering the country started rising just before that, when PP was still in power. In May 2018, according to the data of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 3,937 people arrived in Spain, three times more than the same month in the previous year.       After that, from January 2019 to July 2020, the graphic shows similar values to the ones prior to the change of power. In part, that is because Sánchez executive gave €30 million to the Moroccan government in order to help them pay “the costs incurred in their cooperation with Spain and the entire EU on border management and the fight against irregular immigration headed for the Spanish coast”, according to El País, the Spanish newspaper that revealed the information. That amount of money was added to the €140 million that the EU promised Morocco for the same reason.  The second peak started last July and began to go down at the end of 2020. Most of the arrivals were to the Canary Islands, around 20,000. This route had almost been inactive since 2006 when 36,000 people arrived on the islands. Some NGOs, such as the Spanish Commission for the Help of Refugees say that this peak “includes new profiles of people”, mainly because of the “economic consequences of the pandemic” in Morocco and Senegal.  The European perspective The same data from the UNHCR shows that Spain was the main entry point for irregular migrants in the Mediterranean to European countries in 2020, eight points higher than Italy, the second one. However, as the graphic shows, there is no consistency during the last six years. Greece has led the list twice, in 2015 and 2019. And the same applies to Italy, in 2016 and 2017. The percentages by country vary deeply and, in the case of Spain, they cannot be solely linked to Pedro Sánchez. In fact, almost half of 2018 the country was led by PP and in 2019, when Sánchez was already prime minister for the whole year, Spain just had 26% of the European entries.    Conclusion In short, while it is true that Spain was the main entrance of irregular migrants in Europe in 2020 and 2018, this varies greatly each year and there is no clear trend. In 2019, Greece held that position; and in 2017, Italy did. There is also no clear way to link it to the Spanish Government’s actions because this increase started before Pedro Sánchez became prime minister and has fluctuated a lot since he has been in office for a great number of reasons. The Government has publicly shown its willingness to stop irregular migrations and has cooperated with Morocco in that sense. That is why VOX’s statement is mostly false.  Read more about how we analysed VOX’s claims about immigration in our Behind The Facts blogpost.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Berta Posas, Berta Codina, Àlex Gutiérrez and Pau Torres, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ES Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

The progressive parties voted agents the statement. When asked to explain their view GroenLinks (green party) leader Jesse Klaver claimed that nuclear energy, as a solution for fossil energy, is the biggest lie in this election. He also claimed that nuclear energy will not help achieve the climate goals from the Paris treaty.   The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty against climate change. The accord was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21, on 12 December 2015 and put into action on 4 November 2016 (United Nations). One of the goals in the accord is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century (United Nations).  “The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt its effects.” (United Nations) Nuclear power plants across the globe Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation. During its life cycle a nuclear power plant produces about the same amount of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per unit of electricity as wind, and one-third of the emissions per unit of electricity when compared with solar (World Nuclear Association). Average life-cycle carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions for different electricity generators (Source: IPCC)  Since April 2020, there are 440 operable power reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 390 GW. Additionally, there are 55 reactors under construction and 109 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 63 GW and 118 GW. Respectively there are 329 more reactors proposed (World Nuclear Association). Across the European Union are 106 nuclear power reactors (104 GWe) operating in 13 of the 27 EU member states that account for over one-quarter of the electricity generated in the whole of the EU. Over half of the EU’s nuclear electricity is produced in only one country – France. The 57 units operating in three non-EU countries (Russia, Ukraine and Switzerland) account for about 15-20% of the electricity in the rest of Europe. Norway and Switzerland are effectively part of the EU synchronous grid (World Nuclear Association). Source: World Nuclear Association The role of a nuclear power plant in fighting climate change Nuclear power, which currently means energy derived from fission (splitting the uranium atom), has a minima carbon footprint of around the 15-50g CO2/KWh.  In comparison the average footprint of gas as energy source, is around 450g CO2/KWh. According to these numbers, using nuclear power can be a good way to reduce the carbon footprint and achieve the climate goals. Also, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nuclear energy currently contributes to the prevention of CO2 emission of about 1.3 to 2.6 gigatons each year, assuming it replaces either gas-or coal-fired generation (World Nuclear Association). Besides that, one kilogram of uranium (U235) generates almost 23 million kWh of electricity: enough to provide nearly seven thousand households with electricity for a year. About 30 percent of the energy contained in uranium is converted into electricity (efficiency). According to GroenLinks (green party) this is no reason to invest in nuclear power plants. In an email, the party explained their position as follows: “Uranium, which is used for nuclear power generation, will run out over time. Whereas, we can always count on wind and solar energy”. Another argument for nuclear energy, which is used quite often, is that nuclear energy provides investment opportunities and jobs and the basis for economic security in communities that host nuclear plants. Nuclear power plants as an alternative source of energy The political parties that are against nuclear power and believe that it’s not contributing to the CO2 emissions, are also wondering if nuclear power plants are a feasible option to reduce fossil fuel and help to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.  Their most used argument is that building a nuclear power plant takes a long time and will cost billions of euros. Besides that, the construction costs of nuclear power plants depend on many different determinants such as: design revisions during construction, large plant size and complex large-scale technology, lack of standardization, serialization and modularization, plant safety and environmental concerns, prevention of accidents and risks. These possible cost determinants (see table 1) can influence the construction time of Power Plants (PWRs) and are classified in three general groups: technical, regulatory, and institutional (Construction time of Power Plants PWRs). Figure 2: Construction time of PWRs          During 1980 and 2000 the time for building a nuclear power plant was 92 months or 7.7 years with a maximum of 10 years. Nowadays building a nuclear power plant will take 41 months, still almost 4 years, due to innovation. Lots of goals are aimed at 2050 (mid-century), that is only 30 years from now. We will have 25 years from the moment the nuclear plant is operational, is that enough? According to the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD, yes. Modern nuclear power plants can very well do the absorb variations in the supply of sustainable sources. Nuclear power plants adjust between 50 and 100% power at a rate of 5% per minute. For example, nuclear energy in France has been providing for forty years adjustable CO2-neutral electricity, 24 hours per day, seven days a week (Nuclear energy is needed to achieve the climate goals). It will take renewed attention and a sense of urgency across the world to stimulate a new wave of nuclear investments. The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation is a political minefield at every level. Beyond technological problems, it is politics that is the biggest obstacle to the more widespread adoption of nuclear energy (Clingendael Spector). Advantages and disadvantages of a nuclear power plant Another argument against nuclear power is radioactive waste. Opponents of nuclear energy consider this as one of the most important arguments. There is not yet a good way to store or process it. For example, in the Netherlands nuclear power has been stored in the southern province Zeeland. The low to medium radioactive waste is stored in a bunker. Poured into concrete, in order to limit the radiation as much as possible. The highly radioactive waste is stored in another bunker, also poured into concrete and stored in iron tubes. Because radioactive waste does not decay and remains on earth for thousands of years, storage is no long-term solution. Figure 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear power Conclusion With the statement “Nuclear energy is the biggest lie in this election”, Klaver expresses his opinion that nuclear energy is not the answer to a zero-emissions future “we do not have time, it is not sustainable, and we can better spend the money on more future-proof solutions, which will also benefit the coming generations,” he argued. However, nuclear energy as a solution to reduce CO2-emissions is not inherently a “lie”, as Klaver states. Supporters of nuclear energy rightfully point at the low CO2-emissions. But if it will prove to be a solution for meeting the climate goals in the Paris agreement is a very complicated issue. Klavers’ statement is as much a prediction as the position of the supporters of nuclear power. And therefore uncheckable.

In television programme Studio City he said that generally speaking Slovenia has had one of the longest “lockdowns” in Europe. He also stated Slovenia had a thorough system that, in his opinion, did not work. This statement is mostly true. Zdravko Počivalšek is Slovenian Minister of Economic Development and Technology. He became the minister in 2018. He is also the president of political party Stranka modernega centra – SMC. During the coronavirus pandemic, Počivalšek was criticized for the large government purchase of protective masks, which were not suitable for use by health professionals. Although many called for his resignation, the minister did not do so. On 7 December 2020, he was a guest on a television programme Studio City broadcasted by RTV Slovenija, where they discussed coronavirus measures, lockdowns and current political situation in the country. During the show, Počivalšek made the statement, that Slovenia had “one of the longest” lockdowns in Europe. He continued that the system of a lockdown is a “thorough” one but in his opinion it has not been working. In the weeks prior to his appearance on the show, the Slovenian public could see a battle going on between Zdravko Počivalšek and then Minister of Health Tomaž Gantar.  Počivalšek was explaining that the country has to reopen some economics sectors otherwise the Slovenian economy will collapse. And at the same time Gantar was trying to implement an even stricter lockdown and saying that the current restrictions aren’t strict enough to fight the pandemic effectively. Minister Gantar’s party DeSUS has since left the coalition and a day later Gantar has resigned as Minister of Health. Minister Zdravko Počivalšek on Studio City show on 7 December 2020Link: https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/studio-city/174737910 What is lockdown and why is the system not working? We contacted minister Počivalšek via e-mail to get further information on his statement. In his response to our questions, given to us by his PR team, minister Počivalšek stated that his claim is “based on the adopted government decrees, which during the exposed period prohibited, for example, movement between municipalities, gathering, movement at night, operation of many service activities, etc.” The Minister also said that the country has a thorough lockdown and this claim is based on “comparison with other countries in the region, where certain activities that were banned in our country were allowed, such as restaurants and bars and certain segments of trade (eg the sale of technical goods)”. He is acknowledging that other countries in the region also had thorough lockdowns but “by stating that the system is not working, it is crucial that despite the longest and most thorough “lockdown” compared to other countries in the region, we cannot see a reduction in the number of newly infected, hospitalized and people who need intensive care. Which is actually the basic purpose and goal of lockdown”. We did not get the exact answer from the minister on our question about the longevity of the lockdown in Slovenia. Furthermore, his PR team did not provide us with the names of the countries with which he made the comparison. As it is hard to say which measurement marks the beginning of lockdown in different countries it is also hard to state when the lockdowns started in different countries and, consequently, we can not compare the longevity across Europe with accuracy. As a result of all the differences it is difficult to establish a clear definition of lockdown. Even minister’s definition is vague. For further information about the effectiveness of measures in Slovenia we contacted the Head of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the the National Institute of Public Health but we did not get his answer. The Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Governments around the world all choose slightly different approaches to dealing with coronavirus outbreak. Because of the wide range of measures taken it is hard to compare different governments’ tactics in battling this pandemic. For the purposes of research and easier comparison of these measures around the world the researchers at Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford created a tool The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)    OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic on 18 indicators such as school closures and travel restrictions. It now has data from more than 180 countries. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid. Seven of the indicators (H1-H7) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime, emergency investments into healthcare and most recently, vaccination policies. The data from the 19 indicators is aggregated into a set of four common indices, reporting a number between 1 and 100 to reflect the level of government action. COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index on 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-12-07&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=World Comparing stringency indexes in Europe In his appearance on the show Počivalšek was talking about the second lockdown in Slovenia which officially started on 18th of October 2020 when the government declared an epidemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. On that date the stringency index for Slovenia was 47.22. Compared to some of the bigger countries in Europe on the same date Slovenia actually has one of the lowest stringency indexes. For example Spain had a stringency index of 64.35, Netherlands had 62.04, UK 60.19 and Austria 58.80. According to these numbers we can say that other countries in Europe actually had stricter measures in place before Slovenia declared the second start of the epidemic. COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index for Europe on 18 October 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-10-18&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=Europe However, policies change every day. Slovenia implemented stricter measures the next day so the stringency index jumped up to 64.81. By the 7th of December Slovenia did not have a big change in stringency index, it only went up by cca. four points (to 68.52).  As time went by, other countries also adapted their measures. For example, Spain had a stringency index of 71.30 (+6.95), UK had a stringency index of 66.67 (+6.48) and Austria which had a stringency index of 71.30 (+12.50).  COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index from 18 October to 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&time=2020-10-18..2020-12-07&country=SVN~DEU~FRA~GBR~ITA~NLD~SWE~GRC~ESP~AUT&region=Europe COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index for Europe on 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-12-07&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=Europe Conclusion In short, we can see that the original statement was vague and it did not state where on the spectrum Slovenia was located. Because of the constant changes in government measures around the world it is very hard to determine which country has the most thorough system or the longest lockdown. The word lockdown itself is vague and its meaning could differ between countries. For Europeans curfew could be the most thorough measure and most controversial while in other countries people do not oppose it. As our analysis shows measures taken in Slovenia have not deviated much from the measures adopted in other European countries across the autumn months. Thus, we confirm that the lockdown was indeed “thorough”, but it is not possible to confirm or debunk indefinetly whether it was also “one of the longest” because the lockdowns’ longevities are hard to estabilsh and compare across countries. On the basis of our analysis and reasoning of the factcheck, we find Počivalšek’s statement mostly true.

He is off by 30 billion.”;2021-03-17;eufactcheck;;On 28 February the Dutch minister of finance and leader of the Christian democrat party CDA, Wopke Hoekstra, participated in an election debate broadcast by RTL. During this debate, he stated that the costs of Dutch healthcare exceed 100 billion euros. In a response on Twitter, member of Parliament Fleur Agema, number 2 on the ballot for the right wing Freedom Party (PVV), stated that Hoekstra was off by 30 billion and that the actual expenditures are less than 70 billion euros. Her claim turns out to be mostly false.   Figure 1: Fleur Agema’s tweet, which is mostly false In her tweet, Agema refers to data from 2019 published by the Dutch Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS), specifically to ‘zorguitgaven onder plafond’ (healthcare expenditure ‘under ceiling’) as seen in figure 2.   Figure 2: ‘Healthcare expenditure under ceiling’, ministry of VWS Hoekstra however, referred to a number indicating the total of all healthcare expenditures, from a different set of data, published in 2019 by the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS), as seen in figure 3. This is stated by Fabian Paardekooper, representative of the Ministry of Finance. Figure 3: Total of all healthcare expenditures, CBS According to Astrid Plas from CBS the source Agema uses is not representative for the total amount of healthcare expenditures incurred by the Dutch government. The data from VWS does not include expenditures such as: Healthcare paid for by additional insuranceUninsured healthcare that people pay for by themselves Healthcare and welfare work paid for by municipalities Occupational healthcare and labor reintegrationPopulation screening Maintenance costs (government and health insurers) Forensic care and shelter for refugees Day-care services  Conclusion In short, PVV’s Fleur Agema states: ‘Finance minister Hoekstra is off by 30 billion euro’ in his statement on Dutch healthcare expenditure. According to her, healthcare costs amount to 70 billion, not 100 billion euro. But Hoekstra referred to the sum of all healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands based on data from the statistics bureau CBS. The source used by Fleur Agema is only representative of a certain part of these healthcare costs. However, Hoekstra left room for misinterpretation by not clearly defining that he was referring to the total costs of Dutch healthcare. Therefore, we cannot state that Agema’s claim is completely false. We conclude that her claim is mostly false.

Anastasia Bashkatova, Deputy Head of the Economics Department of “Nezavisimaya Gazeta” quoted First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov saying that Russia’s labour productivity is 2–2.5 times lower than in most developed countries, and 1.5 times lower than in less developed countries. In this statement, the author refers to the data given in the presentation by Mr. Belousov, which states that if Russia reaches the current level of labour productivity in Italy, 36 million workers in the Russian Federation will become redundant and will need to be fired. This is almost every second employee.  Screenshot from the presentation on National Project on Labor Productivity in Russia Contacting the source To clarify this statement, we contacted Mr. Belousov, and were able to get the full version of the presentation in Russian and his answer to the article. However, Mr. Belousov gave his comments regarding data from another article published by the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. Regarding the article “For the sake of economic growth, hidden unemployment will have to be made real”, published by the Vedomosti newspaper on November 9, 2020, Mr. Belousov stated the following: “It contains a false interpretation of the materials we presented at the Hearings at the Coordination Council at the Public Chamber for National Projects and National Saving.” Mr. Belousov also gave us a link to his official response to false claims made by Vedomosti. In his original presentation, he spoke only about ways to improve the labour productivity. Unfortunately, Mr. Belousov did not comment on the comparison of the economies of Russia and Italy. So, we sent two more queries to him from two different email addresses with a request to clarify where did the information about the difference in labour productivity between Russia and Italy come from. Unfortunately, Mr. Belousov did not reply to neither of our emails. Second opinion That is why we decided to get a second opinion from an expert in world economics and interviewed Associate Professor of the Department of Information Technology and Instrumental Methods in Economics – Anna Abrosimova. She told us that comparing two different countries is always a difficult and time-consuming process. Living conditions, different strategic and political positions significantly affect the same socio-economic indicators, so, it is necessary to bring them to relative uniformity to be able to compare. In particular, the indicator of labour productivity is very complex in itself, if only because it has both a natural version of calculation and a value one. We can say that a simple comparison of the labour productivity indicator is incorrect. These countries have different population densities, territorial coverage, and different production structures. Key industries for Russian and Italian GDP. Design by Tatiana Gotishan, Lobachevsky University. Source: Rosstat of Russia, OECD For such a comparison to become possible, it is, also, necessary to assess the factors that will influence this indicator, for example, population size, average wages, working conditions, etc. Only after the research and the assessment of all possible external conditions it would be reasonable to give a comparative assessment of the situation of these two countries on this indicator. Thus, stating that labour productivity in Italy is 2 times higher than in Russia is simply inappropriate. Conclusion In the end, we didn’t manage to find any reference to the claim about the twofold difference published in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta, were unable to get a clear statement from the person, who is quoted on that claim, and our expert made it clear that such a comparison is essentially inappropriate as the objective comparison of labour productivity of two countries with substantially different economies would require an extensive economics research. That is why we believe that this claim should be deemed uncheckable.

The number of wild animals has halved since 1990,” states Dutch political party D66 in its election programme for 2021. With these statements, D66 tries to convince Dutch citizens to support the party in the upcoming national elections. D66 promises to create more nature, protect existing nature and to solve the nitrogen problem. D66 is a social-liberal party counting 25.000 members in 2019. Almost all Dutch political parties are actively promoting nature conservation in the Netherlands. But is the situation for Dutch flora and fauna truly that excruciating? In 2020, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conducted a major study, the Living Planet Report Netherlands, which concluded: “Our unique Dutch nature on land is in worse shape than ever” (WWF, 2020). Jurre Dekker is biologist and agrees with WWF’s statement. “The Netherlands is a very urbanised country, especially compared to Belgium and France. There is no space for nature here,” says Dekker. Due to nature fragmentation, there are always urbanised areas near nature. Dekker: “This brings along noise and light pollution, but it also introduces toxic chemicals into the nature reserve.”   Amongst Europe’s worst nature conservers Compared to other EU countries, the Netherlands is doing badly. The European Environment Agency writes “Europe’s biodiversity continues to decline at an alarming rate, with most protected species and habitats found to be in a bad conservation status” (EEA 2020). As can be deduced from the table below, the Netherlands is in fifth place regarding how conservation is failing in habitats. Habitats refer to the different ecosystems present in the Netherlands. Certain species can only survive in a specific ecosystem. Not all habitats are nature reserves. Another reason why the Netherlands is not scoring well is due to agriculture. Dekker: “The Netherlands has one of Europe’s highest amount of agriculture compared to land ratios. Agriculture means a leaching of pesticides and fertilisers into the surrounding nature reserves.” The report shows how nature in the flat areas of Europe, including the Netherlands, are often in a worse state than mountainous regions. Flat areas are more ideal for agriculture.    Source: European Environment Agency. (2020). State of Nature in the EU (No. 10/2020). Publications office of the European Union   50 per cent decline Regarding the second part of D66’s statement, WWF’s Living Planet Report states that:  “Populations of wildlife species in agricultural areas have halved on average. Populations of wildlife species characteristic of open nature areas, such as heath land, have also declined by 50 per cent on average”. These figures are similar to the rest of the world. A 68% average decline in global vertebrate species populations was found between 1970 and 2016 (EU Science Hub 2020). Furthermore, a recent European assessment of the conservation status of 6000 European species undertaken by IUCN (European Commission 2020) revealed that up to 25% of European animal species are now threatened with extinction.    Leusderheide, a former military zone, is covered with heath fields but closely surrounded by agricultural and urban areas (c) Carien J. Touwen   In conclusion The statement made by Dutch political party D66 in their party programme, “Only 4% of Dutch nature reserves are in good condition and the number of wild animals has halved since 1990” is true. Both research reports and biologist Jurre Dekker underpin the party’s claim. RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Noah Moeys Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

The party promises to make social housing more available to people with smaller incomes by stimulating richer people to move to private housing. The VVD is the Netherlands’ largest political party and known for its conservative-liberal policies. There are two claims to be checked in this statement. The first is ‘The Netherlands has one of the largest social housing sectors in Europe’ and the second is ‘the waiting list for social housing averages nine years’. Largest social housing sector Is the VVD’s first claim about social housing true? In 2018, the Netherlands totalled 7.7 million houses. The amount of social housing units was 2.2 million, according to a study by the Dutch government in 2018. Social housing accounts for 28,7% of the total housing market. According to researcher Alice Pittini and the writers of the academic book Social Housing in Europe, the Netherlands indeed has the largest share of social housing, when seen as a percentage of the country’s total housing market. In Social Housing in Europe (2007), a book published by London School of Economics and Political Science, an interesting distinction about social housing sectors became clear. The Netherlands has the highest percentage of social housing in Europe (now 28,7%). However, France has 4.2 million social houses, compared to the 2.4 million that the Netherlands has. But the 4.2 million French social houses make up only  17% of the total French housing market. Therefore, the Netherlands does have the largest social housing sector in Europe when analysed in the perspective of the national housing market as a whole. Utrecht University professor dr. Joep Steegmans says “The Netherlands indeed has a large social housing sector, though it is hard to compare it to other countries because the definitions of social housing vary.” Steegmans is specialised in the housing market. He points out that Dutch statistics often confuse the amount of houses owned by housing corporations and social housing units. These two aspects are not the same: housing corporations also own houses which are not social houses, meaning the amount of social houses is lower than the amount of houses owned by housing corporations. The Dutch percentage of 28% social housing as a total of the market share is presumably lower. As Steegmans mentions, the definition of social housing differs amongst the EU countries, write also Whitehead & Scanlon, and Sipková et al. “Different definitions are related to a different level of public intervention in this sector. The common feature is the fact that the purpose of social housing is the general interest, the increase of affordable housing supply and that concrete social housing objectives are based on the socio-economic status and risk factors present” (Sipková et al, 2020, p. 60). Waiting list of nine years? Moving on to the second part of the statement, that the average time on a waiting list for a social house is nine years, it appears the VVD isn’t quite right. Country-wide statistics are scarce, though the RIGO housing research institute has looked at waiting time per region. A waiting time of nine years is only true in the provinces of Utrecht and Amsterdam. Furthermore, states RIGO, the term waiting time is often confused with registration time. A person has to actively be responding to house offers if it is to count as waiting time. Steegmans also mentions this. “The VVD has probably used a research project carried out by RTL News (a large commercial television channel), which used the subscription time. It is questionable if this is the best indicator of a waiting list,” says the professor. In other Dutch regions, nine years is not the average waiting time. As can be seen on the figure below, the maximum is 8,9 years, which is seen in Utrecht and Amsterdam.  Source: Kromhout, S., & Wittkämper, L. (2019, March). Stand van de woonruimteverdeling: Wachttijden en verdeling in de praktijk. RIGO Research en Advies. In conclusion The statement made by party VVD, “The Netherlands has one of the largest social housing sectors in Europe but the waiting list for social housing averages nine years”, can be split in two parts. The first, ‘The Netherlands has one of the largest social housing sectors in Europe’, is true but the second ‘the waiting list for social housing averages nine years is false.

82;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-tourists-in-barcelona-will-not-be-able-to-rent-an-apartment/;“Tourists in Barcelona will not be able to rent an apartment”;2021-02-24;eufactcheck;;Since the 26 of August, 2020, in Barcelona in the north-east of Spain, there is a ban, according to which Barcelona citizens cannot offer tourists accommodation in their apartments. The same day polish newspaper claimed that “Tourists in Barcelona will not be able to rent an apartment”, but this interpretation isn’t completely true.  On August 26th, the Autonomous Government of Catalonia passed a law stating that it will notbe possible to rent out apartments to tourists in Barcelona. However, this is not a very restrictive document, since no institution has been designated to inspect the apartments that have been used to house visitors. Interestingly, in Barcelona alone there are about 3000 (out of 9000) apartments that could illegally host tourists. Furthermore, the new law has introduced a ban on the conversion of residential buildings into lodgings. Why do regional authorities do this? Well, according to Eurostat, in 2017, more than 42% of Spanish households spent 40% of their income on rent (17 percentage points above the EU average). The problem was found to be especially severe in areas with increased tourist activity. This includes Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga and Tenerife.  The biggest increase in the number of apartments rented to tourists is undoubtedly due to the use of Internet platforms such as Airbnb, which are often subject to sanctions and fines (for example in Barcelona). Although the portal claims that its goal has become to expand its activities in peripheral areas, in fact, the largest concentrations of apartments rented through Airbnb are located in the very center of large cities. The consequence of this may be the relocation of permanent residents outside the central districts, leading to a complete substitution of residential life by tourism. Gentrification in Spain has gained pace with constantly rising rents and extensive use of apartments in historical districts by tourists. It is estimated that between 2009 and 2016 Airbnb made a 4% contribution to the increase of rentals in Barcelona, although similar phenomena were also observed in cities such as Madrid, Palma de Mallorca and Valencia. Of the 8124 Spanish municipalities, 4882 (60.1%) has at least one offer on Airbnb, but most of the municipalities have only a few. The largest number of Airbnb sites can be found in large cities, as well as on the Mediterranean coast and on the Canary and Balearic Islands. Portals such as Airbnb do not pose a significant threat to hotels or other resorts, since they usually have different target groups. Earlier studies on a local scale confirm: even if Airbnb’s lodging is located in the same areas as hotels, their offer may be addressed to different clients. In fact, Airbnb seems to compete mainly with lower class hotels or lodging services, but not with luxury hotels. Conclusion To sum up, tourists will be able to rent an apartment for a short period of time, but as a result of the new regulations, such facilities will be located on the outskirts of Spanish cities to provide decent living conditions for permanent residents without radically increasing the rent prices.  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

83;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-in-brussels-the-trade-fair-for-live-goods-began-children-are-put-up-for-sale/;In Brussels, the trade fair for live goods began. Children are put up for sale;2021-02-19;eufactcheck;;Wpolitce.pl – a popular Polish right-wing news portal and TVP Info, a state news channel, report on alleged human trafficking taking place at Men Having Babies conference in Brussels. Misconception caused by terminology used in an article Due to the conservative predilection of the reporter – Grzegorz Górny – an article gains a tabloid tint. It is supposed to play on readers’ emotions and remain shocking. Thus the author calls an event Children’s Fair implying illegal child trafficking. It must be remembered that an event should be discussed according to surrogacy laws. It raises a question how the surrogacy law differs between Belgium and Poland where the article was published. Screenshot from the https://www.menhavingbabies.org  Despite that article of Grzegorz Górny is strongly biased on his opinion we decided that as fact-checkers we cannot deal with personal believes and we should focus on hard data instead. In order to acquire as much information about MHB as possible, we wrote and sent a letter to this institution. We found the email address on their website (menhavingbabies.org). Specifically we wanted to obtain some information about the so called “catalog prices”, as Wpolitice.pl is quite precise about the prices MHB “sells kids” for.  Prices are also mentioned in the article of “The Brussels Times”, which refers to American company International Surrogacy Center, which provides guidance and support for both surrogates and intended parents. Screenshot from the “The Brussels Times”, To our disappointment we didn’t receive any response from MHB, which is remarkable because MHB’s website provides many options to get in touch with them, depending on whether you’re a prospective client, member of the press or an independent researcher. Belgian legislation The author of the article was right about legal situation of surrogacy in Belgium. Numerous sources confirm that Belgian law do not regulate matter of surrogacy so it’s not prohibited or legalised.” Current Belgian legislation does not address the issue of surrogacy or of children born via surrogacy, In light of this legislative vacuum, the Belgian federal government has no choice other than to ignore any legal consequences of foreign documents created in this context (e.g. birth certificates or judgements). This position is adopted even if the local legal procedure has been followed meticulously abroad and the documents have been properly legalised or apostilled for use in Belgium. What results in legal implications abroad is not automatically recognised by the Belgian internal Rule of Law”. Case of surrogacy is the grey area of law. What happens in this grey area is beyond our ability as factcheckers.“Contrary to neighbouring countries, Belgium’s surrogacy laws have not been updated, meaning commercial surrogacy sits in a legal grey zone. Even though all political parties in Belgium are against it, it also mentioned that protestors were demanding a legal ban on all commercial promotion of surrogacy in Belgium.” “Currently, Belgium does not have specific legislation in matters of surrogacy. The nullity of surrogacy conventions results from the illegality of its object and its ’cause’, its opposition to the principles of non-availability of the human body and the civil status as well as the inalienable and non-available right of the mother who bears and gives birth to a child to determine parentage. However, some hospitals take advantage of the legislative gap to attend to requests of surrogacy. Doing so outside any legal framework, these hospitals have established strict rules to condition the practice of surrogacy”. Commercial character of the conference Due to the lacking statistics from MHB we can’t say how relations between participants and surrogacy agencies looked like. According to International Surrogacy Center (cited by “Brussel Times”) surrogate mother can expect about $55,000.00-$65,000.00 of compensation. At the same time in the article of “The Brussels Times”, the range of prices that candidates need to pay for a child: 90.000-150.000 euros.  At the International Surogacy Center website, there is an Agency Fee item where the Agency’s expenses are listed, but the Agency fee is not specified, in order to find it out, you need to contact the Agency:  Screenshot from  International Surrogacy Center website    According to point number nine of “Ethical framework” published by MHB: “Compensation guidelines for donors and surrogates may be legislated or encouraged in order to avoid unreasonably large sums that may lead to overwhelming financial incentives. While we do not think it is ethically necessary, we believe that it is reasonable for legislators or professionals to decide to enact or promote caps or guidelines for the compensation of surrogates and donors. It is reasonable to assume that such caps may reduce the likelihood that candidates will choose egg donation and surrogacy in the absence of sufficient altruistic motivation, and in circumstances that may lead to adverse long term medical or psychological outcomes. Therefore at the very least compensation guidelines should not be outlawed”. However, this ethical framework seems to be more of a suggestion from organizers than strict rule. In a situation when even legality of such event is not confirmed it’s not clear how this rule should be executed. Due to the  lack of demographic data we cannot exclude the possibility that such event is a financial opportunity for women from regions of EU where general income is much lower than in Belgium or USA. Language of the article Despite that general claims author of article – Grzegorz Górny were not so far from the truth we should stated that his rhetoric could be described as creating false impression that LGBT community stands behind international human traffic.  Using criteria of some scholars as Jana Laura Egelhofer and Sophie Lecheler  usage of strong words like “slavery of woman and trafficking of children” should be considered a manipulation, because of direct calling MHB a crime organization. Allegedly in this project there were involved women from poor countries (which wasn’t proven or denied in case of Brussel conference). “No woman would voluntarily agree to be treated as a breeding mare and to hire her uterus and give birth to a gay couple if she was not forced to do so by the dramatic financial situation. It is no coincidence that surrogates are recruited from very poor countries.” Screenshot from https://www.tvp.info/50725617/dzieci-na-sprzedaz-dla-homoseksualistow  The author of article also creates a false link between the fact that minister of foreign affairs is transgender and that such an event took place. This insinuate that Petra de Sutter was some somehow involved in preparation of such conference but didn’t give any further information for his argument. “In this light, the fact that recently, for the first time in the history of Europe, a transsexual woman became Deputy Prime Minister in Brussels is of new importance. This is the case of Petra de Sutter, an LGBT activist, who strongly demands the legalization of surrogacy in Europe” Everything seems to indicate that we are facing another battle in the cultural war, this time for the legal sanctioning of the austerity.”  Finally Grzegorz Górny places MHB conference in bigger context of endangered conservative values. “A few more years of such brainwashing and the attitude of the public will change. After all, we have already seen that what was treated as a deviation twenty years ago is now considered to be a cultural, social and legal norm. What was killing the helpless became a right for women. It is therefore possible that the surrogacy, i.e. slavery of women and trafficking in children, will also be considered a human right, and crowds will take to the streets to defend this right.”  Conclusion Despite that Grzegorz Górny didn’t give / use any false statistics, quotes or numbers his article should be labeled as a personal opinion due to the lack of specific information about subject of conference. Due to the opinion-forming nature of the article and its highly controversial subject we thought it is appropriate to highlight that this article is based on a conservative opinion (which we don’t criticise). References in the Russian media Many European media reacted to the topic, and the Russian media did not leave it aside. Russian conservative mass media didn’t leave the news about “children’s fair” unattended, although it didn’t become a great sensation. Perhaps the highest point this piece of news reached in russian media is the report by a state-run TV-company NTV. Reporter Anton Chechulinsky asked the participants of the MHB event for some comments including a surrogate mother. This report might seem to be unbiased, since every side of this conflict had their voices heard, but when it comes to the personal opinion of the reporter, which is brightly expressed in this material, it becomes clear, what kind of point the author is trying to make: “In contrast to those, who raise the children of the “third gender”, gays, Fabian and Mario, seem to raise their children in a more conservative way. Lily, their daughter, wears skirts and reads books about princesses. Jack, their son, doesn’t play with girlie toys and wears a baby shirt of a truly masculine colour – blue. One might think that these parents are the best at keeping their children away from stereotypes, but maybe they just want their children to become different to their parents in the future.” Russian Internet-media “Komsomolskaya Pravda” also put out an article about MHB conference in Brussels. Basically, this article is a recital of another article authored by Leone Grotti, a “Tempi” newspaper journalist. The author of this article, Tatyana Ogneva-Salvoni, doesn’t express her attitude to surrogacy and gays having babies directly, using her own words, but mixing the real facts about MHB conference with a pretty adamant opinion of another person doesn’t seem to be quite fair in terms of jornalism.

Further, according to Kiselyov, the match was stopped, and the audience was asked to disperse.  Screenshot from Istanbul Basaksehir Twitter account Indeed, players from both teams accused Colcescu of racism and left the field as a sign of protest. However, on December 10th, Romanian journalist Emanuel Roşu posted a full transcript of the conversation between the participants of the scandal on his Twitter page. After studying all the available video recordings, Roşu found out that the word “negru” wasn’t uttered by Sebastian Coltescu, it was said by his assistant Octavian Sovre. But despite this, it was Coltescu who was accused of racism. It should be recalled, that the program of Dmitry Kiselyov was released on 13 December, three days after the investigation of Emanuel Roşu. Screenshot from www.upi.com But the thing that makes Kiselyov’s story completely inaccurate is that he claims that Sebastian Coltescu has been banned from refereeing permanently. Firstly, as of 25 December 2020 there is not a single publication on the Internet confirming that any official decision has been made with regard to the incident that took place on the 8th of December. Secondly, according to the rules of UEFA, which can be found on the UEFA web page, referees can be suspended for at least 10 matches, but given the circumstances revealed by Emanuel Roşu it is highly possible that Coltescu won’t be punished too harshly. Thirdly, suspending Coltescu permanently doesn’t make any sense because he was expelled from FIFA International Referees List two weeks before the incident. This season will be the last for Coltescu. Conclusion With all that being said, the claim of Dmitry Kiselyov about Sebastian Coltescu being permanently banned from refereeing is completely false.

Since no access to medical records is available, the claim is uncheckable”. The claim from the Russian officials. Source: South China Morning Post First of all, a brief explanation of what happened. On August 20 Kira Yarmish, spokeswoman for Alexei Navalny, an influential Russian opposition politician and Kremlin critic, reported on her Twitter account that he suddenly felt sick and collapsed on his flight from Tomsk to Moscow. Yarmish further reported in her tweet that the plane had to make an emergency landing in Omsk and that Navalny had to be hospitalized because he was unconscious and showed symptoms of poisoning. She claimed that he only had drank one tea at the airport and she suspects that he was poisoned with a tea mixture. With the help of the organization Cinema of Peace and German doctors, Navalny was transported on August 22 from Omsk to Berlin and was admitted to the Berlin Charite for medical treatment. According to the Charité, Navalny was brought back from the medically induced coma on September 7 and he was able to leave the university hospital after 32 days of treatment on September 23. Since then, Navalny has been under personal protection for rehabilitation at the village of Ibach in the Schwarzwald. Alexei Navalny posted a photo from his rehabilitation in the Schwarzwald on Instagram. Source: Instagram Alexei Navalny The EU Perspective Similar to Navalny’s team, the Berlin Charité also expressed the suspicion of Navalny’s alleged poisoning. In a press release, dated on August 20, it is said that the clinical findings indicate poisoning by a substance from the active substance group of cholinesterase inhibitors. According to the press release, the effect of the poison, cholinesterase inhibition in the body, has been proven several times in independent laboratories. In order to determine whether Navalny was really poisoned, the Berlin Charité asked a special laboratory of the German military forces to help. According to a press release of the German government, dated on the 2nd September, the government suspected the poisoning of Navalny with a chemical nerve agent of the Novichok group. These are nerve agents that were developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and researched in Russia until the 1990s. The German government condemns the alleged attack and calls for enlightenment by Russia. According to a press release issued by the German government on  September 14, these results were confirmed by two laboratories in Sweden and France. Like the German Government, the European Parliament is assuming that Navalny’s poisoning has occurred, as stated in the motion for a resolution dated on the 14th September. According to this, the EU assumes an alleged murder and use of chemical weapons. They also urged the Russian authorities to stop the harassment, intimidation and attacks against the opposition, civil society, the media, human rights defenders and other politically committed citizens. On the 6th of October The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) published its report on the investigations of the Navalny case. On the 6th September, a technical assistance visit (TAV) team visited the Charité Hospital in Berlin, where blood and urine sampling was conducted by the hospital staff under the direct supervision and continuous visual observation of the team members. Upon a request of Germany on September 11, the OPCW Laboratory sent the samples to two laboratories for the analysis of biomedical samples. The results of analysis of biomedical samples by the OPCW designated laboratories would allegedly confirm that the biomarkers of the cholinesterase inhibitor found in Mr. Navalny’s blood and urine samples would have similar structural characteristics to the toxic chemicals of the Novichok group. The lack of transparency of EU sources All these reports and press releases state that supposedly poison was the cause of Navalny’s collapse. However, none of the institutions published the blood and urine results. On request, neither the Charité nor the Laboratory of the German military forces were able to give information on the findings or general information on the Navalny case. Prof. Dr. Ulrich Cirkel, former head physician for gynaecology at the University Hospital Minden as well as honorary member of the quality assurance committee of the state of NRW, explains why: “Patient and data protection secrecy has top priority. Without the express permission of the patient, in this case Mr. Navalny, the hospital and the laboratory are not allowed to release any information about the case. “For outsiders there is no way to know whether the statements of the OPCW, the Charité, or the German government are true, as there is no access to the findings. This is why Prof. Dr. Cirkel is quite critical of the reporting in Germany: “It is completely unclear what really happened on the flight. Nevertheless, there is much speculation, often without any background knowledge”. There are not only the investigations of the EU, but also those of the Russian officials. These will be discussed in the next section. Position of Russian official media outlets The aim of the investigation was to find poisonous substances in food, water, on Navalny’s clothes, items from the hotel, and from the café at the airport. The results of the inspection were published on the 6 of November at the Department of Transport of Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Siberian Federal District’s website. According to the press release, experts did not find any poisonous substances on gathered materials. That is why the officials decided to ask companions of Alexey Navalny about the state of his health and any possible complaints. His wife, Julia Navalny, stated that her husband had limited his consumption of food, that he had felt discomfort after eating for 3-5 days, and that his meal schedule had been irregular. She also suggested that the patient’s weight-reducing diets could have been the reason for the pain. The final diagnosis made by Russian doctors and based on repeated chemical and toxicological studies is the violation of carbohydrate metabolism and chronic pancreatitis. The press release also said that another version – poisoning – has not been confirmed according to the results of clinical, anamnestic, and chemical-toxicological studies. This is what Alexander Murakhovsky, the head physician of the Omsk hospital, where Alexei Navalny was first taken, reports: “There are few current diagnoses, the main of them to which we are leaning towards is a violation of the carbohydrate balance, that is, a metabolic disorder. This may be caused by a sharp drop in blood sugar during the flight, which caused the loss of consciousness. Currently, our resuscitators together with resuscitators from Burdenko are doing everything possible to ensure that Navalny Alexey Anatolyevich is brought out of the coma”. The head of the inspection group Sergey Potapov, Deputy Head of the Investigation Department of the Transport Directorate, also mentioned in the text, states that the Ministry sent requests for legal assistance to the competent authorities of Germany, Sweden and France, but none of the given answers contained essential information. However, the inspection of the circumstances of Navalny’s hospitalization is still in process. The ambulance car of the Bundeswehr, which brought Alexei Navalny to the clinic. Photo: EPASource: Russian socio-political newspaper “Novaya Gazeta” The dose is crucial for Novichok For more detailed information, we decided to contact Vladimir Uglev, one of the creators of Novichok. Here are some quotes from the answer to our request about how the substance affects a person: “Novichok is a neuroparalytic agent, i.e. it blocks the activity of Choline Esterases (ChE) in the body. In its toxic properties this agent is very close to the American Vx, but some samples of Novichok in their combat effectiveness exceed Vx by up to 10 times”. How soon symptoms may appear “depends on the method of admission and the amount of Novichok. In case of inhalation damage, the effect of the Novichok is manifested almost at the same rate as during intramuscular injection – within a few minutes, with minimal doses up to half an hour. At the same time, miosis, sweating, feeling of fear, convulsions, which are common for the neuroparalytic agents are observed. When a higher dose of Novichok is administered it may cause involuntary defecation, ending with paralysis of the respiratory center and death. When the actual lethal amount of Novichok (about 12-15 milligrams per person weighing 70-80 kg) is injected into the human body or inhaled/consumed, no methods of life support and attempts to treat do not lead to an improvement in the condition of a victim and everything ends in death”. Thus, Russian official sources deny the possible poisoning of Alexei Navalny with a substance from the Novichok group. According to the expert, Navalny could have survived the Novichok poisoning if he received a dose of no more than 30% of the lethal dose for him (about 3 milligrams). Conclusion In summary, both sides come to a different conclusion. While the majority of Russian officials identify pancreatitis as the reason for the collapse, the majority of European officials assume that Navalny was poisoned. However, due to laws and data protection regulations, both sides are not allowed to publish the official blood and urine values of Navalny, which would clarify the reason for the collapse. For this reason, it cannot be clarified beyond doubt whether the claim is true or false. Therefore, the claim is categorized as “uncheckable”.

86;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-pcr-tests-do-not-tell-if-someone-is-infected-or-contagious/;“PCR tests do not tell if someone is infected or contagious”;2021-01-11;eufactcheck;;On 20 October 2020 Slovenian TV presenter Marko Potrč claimed in his Facebook post that the tests performed to detect the presence of the virus (PCR) do not tell if someone is actually infected or even contagious. He said that dr. Lejko Zupanc, infectious disease specialist, also had to admit this on national television. This statement is misleading and thus mostly false.  Marko Potrč is a Slovenian TV presenter, who became more active on social media, particularly on Facebook, during the global pandemic. His first post that went viral was published in the beginning of July. He is focusing on criticising government measures which also results in undermining the health professionals and their work. While constantly posting he gained a lot of supporters and sympathizers. His huge reach (more than 1,000 likes on post) and audience engagement also led to mentioning him in mass media. Marko Potrč’s original post. Source: https://www.facebook.com/PotrcMarko/posts/3431861533573498  In the previously mentioned Facebook post he is defending himself by answering to the public and expert’s criticism regarding coronavirus – measures and the virus itself. He explains himself by giving 13 statements – the claim we factchecked is one of them. In this particular post, he does not draw from opinions of professionals. The first person we contacted in the process of factchecking was the author himself. We wanted to get information about the motive that drew him to make the post and the original sources on which the claim was based. Unfortunately, we did not get his reply. As the author of the claim Marko Potrč is not an expert on this topic and because of the current panic around the pandemic and tests, we deemed it appropriate to get professional and scientific opinions on the matter. In his post Potrč is leaning on a statement of dr. Tatjana Lejko Zupanc, the head of Clinic for Infectious Diseases and Fever Conditions Ljubljana, in an interview for national television Let’s beat COVID-19. It must be pointed out that Potrč only used a small part of her statement and ignored her further explanation. Because of this we contacted her to get her response and explanation on this topic. Additionally we contacted another expert, an infectologist who wishes to stay anonymous. He is currently working as an infectologist at the COVID department, while the amount of attacks on medical staff is getting more and more intense, therefore he wishes not to be judged based on his medical opinion. Being infected VS. being contagious Firstly, the distinction needs to be made between being infected and being contagious.  “An individual with whom the occupation occurred has become infected. According to the Slovenian Medical Dictionary, an infection is “the intrusion of pathogenic organisms (viruses, prions, bacteria, fungi, parasites) into the body and their reproduction, which may or may not be followed by clinical signs of disease. Being contagious means that one individual is able to spread his infection to others,”  the infectologist explains.  What do PCR tests actually detect? According to our second expert, dr. Lejko Zupanc, the PCR tests are being used to prove the presence of the virus’ nucleic acid. ‘’As long as the nucleic sequence (in this case SARS CoV2 virus RNA) is present in the sample in a sufficiently high number, it will be detected by a PCR test. However, the method itself cannot distinguish between nucleic acid from active microorganisms and nucleic acid from inactive (‘dead’) microorganisms that can remain in the body after overcoming infections,’’ adds the infectologist.  The amount of virus and its activity can be checked by additional methods. ‘’There are ways in which we can predict the viral load from the result of PCR testing, namely the number of CT (Cycle Threshold). The higher this number, the less nucleic material is in the sample being examined, the less likely a patient is to be actively infected or contagious,’’ explains the infectologist. This information can help the professional in deciding what stage of the disease the subject is in. Both of our experts agree that the laboratory results must be interpreted with the full clinical picture of the patient. ‘’If someone has clinical signs and a positive PCR test this is evidence of the disease. If someone has no clinical signs and has appropriate epidemiological data and a positive PCR test he is infected, the infectivity level can not be judged, it may or may not be present. For safety reasons we believe that a person is still spreading the virus. If someone had covid some time ago and has no clinical signs and a positive PCR test, we can consider it to be a residual virus which means that a person is not contagious at the moment,’’ says dr. Lejko Zupanc. ‘’The first rule of interpretation of any investigations in medicine is to interpret them together with the clinical picture,’’ explains the infectologist.  Conclusion In short the PCR test is currently the most sensitive and specific test on the market to detect the presence of the virus. However, it only tells us that the desired nucleic sequence is present in the body, which means that the person has been in contact with a microorganism. The test solely does not tell us if the person is actively infected or even contagious, but the test must always be interpreted with a full clinical picture or additional tests. Therefore we find Potrč’s statement misleading and we rate it as mostly false.  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

87;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-abortion-restriction-does-not-prevent-abortion-it-just-makes-them-less-safe/;“Abortion restriction does not prevent abortion, it just makes them less safe”;2021-01-08;eufactcheck;;Amnesty International Slovenia tweeted via their account on 23 October 2020, claiming that “Abortion restriction does not prevent abortion, it just makes them less safe”. This was found to be true. Amnesty International Slovenia organization posted on their Twitter account an image with text stating that abortion restriction does not prevent abortion, it just makes them less safe. The relevance of this topic rose again after the ruling of the Polish Constitutional Court, making abortions unconstitutional even in the event of a foetal defect. This event caused a huge backlash in the Polish and international community and was considered a systematic wave of attacks on women’s rights. Due to the current laws on abortion restrictions in their own country, Polish women are forced to seek abortion in neighbouring countries. The Amnesty International Slovenia post is a direct response to the events happening in Poland, as it mentions the case and gives further information on the issues of abortion restrictions. This fact check process was focused on the part of the post regarding abortion restrictions and the safety related to it. Source: Screenshot of Twitter Amnesty Slovenia https://twitter.com/AmnestySlovenia/status/1319546640726953984 The research As our contacted experts from the Women’s Lobby of Slovenia and Institute 8th of March did not answer, we based our fact-check mainly on the links provided by Amnesty International Slovenia, the author of the post, but also on articles and websites found during our own research. We contacted Amnesty International Slovenia, asking about the primary source of their claim. They explained it is a summary of the claim from Amnesty International, which they are a part of and use the same content. They also sent us a link in which it is stated, that 25 million unsafe abortions take place each year, the vast majority taking place in developing countries. In another link, provided by Amnesty International Slovenia, which was based on a research, carried out by the Guttmacher Institute, Lancet Global Health and WHO, the results show that legal restrictions on abortion do not affect its incidence. In the research it was found that unintended pregnancy rates were generally higher in settings where abortion is restricted than in settings where it is broadly legal. The abortion rate for countries where abortion is restricted was 36 per 1,000 women aged 15–49, and for countries where abortion is broadly legal, the rate was 40.  For example, the abortion rate is 29 to 38 per 1,000 women aged 15–49 in Sub-Saharan Africa, where abortion is illegal in many circumstances. Besides being completely prohibited (for example Egypt, Madagascar, Angola), circumstances include to save the woman’s life, to preserve health, social or economic grounds, and in cases of a rape and incest. Source: Screenshot of the map of The World’s Abortion Laws by the Center of Reproductive Rights https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws Whereas, in Europe and North America the rate is 15 to 20 per 1,000 women aged 15–49, where abortion is generally permitted on broad grounds. Meaning that abortions usually can be done on request, with exceptions of some countries, where the environment and social or economic factors of the woman are taken into consideration before the abortion. The map above illustrates the various conditions of abortion laws in the world. A research from 2017 carried out by WHO and other organizations, published in Lancet shows that between years 2010 and 2014, 55.7 million abortions occurred worldwide each year. Out of that, 25.1 million (45.1 %) abortions were not safe, with 24.3 million (97 %) of them carried out in developing countries. World Health Organization defines unsafe abortion as a procedure for termination of a pregnancy done by an individual who does not have the necessary training or in an environment not conforming to minimal medical standards. The same research states that between continents, with 13.5 million, Asia has the highest number of unsafe abortions, among which South central Asian countries have more than 9 million cases. Africa together had 6.8 million cases of abortion, with 6.2 million of unsafe abortions. Distributed over all the continent and with the highest number of over 2 million cases in Eastern Africa. Latin America had 4.9 million unsafe abortions, with almost 3.5 million in South America, while Europe the number of unsafe abortion (483,000) per year is significantly lower than safe one (3.8 million). One of the conclusions presented by the research was that in comparison the number of unsafe abortions was notably higher in countries where laws induced strong restrictions on abortions than in countries with less restrictive abortion laws: “When the distribution of abortion safety was considered by the legal status of abortion, almost 87.5 % in the 57 countries in which abortion was available on request were safe compared with 25.2 % in the 62 countries where abortion was completely banned or allowed only to save the woman’s life or to preserve her physical health.” Conclusion In short, it can be said that the statement by Amnesty Slovenia on Twitter that abortion restrictions do not prevent abortions, just make them less safe turned out to be true. The research showed that abortion restrictions do indeed not prevent from abortions but can actually increase the numbers in some cases. The second part of the statement of abortions becoming less safe was also confirmed to be true, as abortions, carried out illegally, were found to be more unsafe.

88;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-we-have-to-provide-our-soldier-with-basic-equipment-for-work/;“We have to provide our soldier with basic equipment for work”;2021-01-08;eufactcheck;;"At the end of 2020, Slovenian parliament passed 780 million euro bill of investments. Member of the Slovenian Parliament Alenka Jeraj stated that Slovenian soldiers do not have the equipment they deserve; they have to wear shoes and helmets in bad condition. The statement was used to justify the large amount of money provided by the new law. However, only small amount of funding will actually go into personal equipment. In 2018, Slovenian Army had many problems with their equipment. With their shoes in bad condition, the Slovenian soldiers were supposed to participate in the combat capability test at Poček near Postojna, and it was said that due to the mentioned problems, some of the soldiers even got frostbite. Furthermore, in 2018, information about only a week-old, but already run-down shoes of the Slovenian soldiers at a NATO exercise in Norway leaked to the public. Today, the situation is different. We can see that the Slovenian Army improved their basic equipment. Now, the main topic is not bad condition of their shoes but other major problems. That reflects in recent investment in the Slovenian Army, which in the current health crisis, caused a great deal of public disapproval and also lead to collecting signatures for a referendum. As defence minister Matej Tonin said in June 2020, with 780 million worth of investments in army force, Slovenia will possibly achieve commitments towards NATO by year 2026. It is demanded that Slovenia dedicates 2 % of its GDP to its army. Alenka Jeraj, Member of Parliament and Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) was part of TV news programme Political with Tanja Gobec. It is a political commentary format that broadcast on public television TV Slovenia. The programme was also attended by Jerca Korča, a member of the opposition liberal LMŠ party. The debate was about a new package of laws related to the coronavirus epidemic, where, according to the opposition, several laws unrelated to the epidemic have been filed. They also talked about changes in the electoral legislation and about the mentioned investments in the army. Jerca Korče criticized the government coalition about wrong timing of the proposed heavy investments in the army during the COVID-19 crisis. Alenka Jeraj said that the Slovenian Army had been receiving negative assessments for several years and this government is just fulfilling what previous governments have promised. She also stated: “It’s not hygienic that our soldiers don’t have the equipment they deserve, they wear bad shoes, helmets etc. I mean, we have to provide them with the basic equipment so they can work and perform their profession.” Alenka Jeraj, Member of Parliament, in the TV news programme Political with Tanja Gobec, screenshot.  Alenka Jeraj is a long-standing member of the political party SDS. The current government is a four-party coalition, led by SDS. Besides their president, Jeraj is known for being one of the most outspoken and active members of the party, especially when it comes to their standpoints regarding media. We asked SDS to explain, on which information Alenka Jeraj based her statement that soldiers lack personal equipment. They were not willing to answer. What is the condition of Slovenian Army? “Due to the almost halved defense budget, the Slovenian Army has been underfunded both in terms of personnel and material resources for the last decade. The cuts to the budget of the Slovenian Armed Forces are expressed in its combat capabilities, in its equipment with military equipment and armaments. The statements you cite probably stem from these facts,” stated Slovenian Army in an email response when asked to comment on the statement in question. Furthermore, the army explained that all funds for Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) are provided by Ministry of Defense. All members of the army have military boots, helmets and other equipment provided by the formation or mission. From this point of view, the SAF has enough boots and helmets, they stated. “However, it is true that an individual member cannot replace these boots at any time, even, for example, if they were damaged/destroyed on duty before the scheduled deadline for replacement (in the SAF, the deadlines for all personal equipment are determined according to the duties / loads of particular unit).” Slovenian Army also provided us with the purchases made in the last few years. In 2018, they bought 4,600 boots and 11 helmets. In 2019 they bought 12,250 boots and 150 helmets. In 2020, they bought 715 helmets and no boots. Together with contractual reservists, in June 2020 the Slovenian Army consisted of 6,977 soldiers. Jelena Juvan, PhD, Assistant Professor at the Department of Defense Studies at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, says: “If we disregard the political context of this statement, it is partly accurate and indicates the extreme equipment shortages between members of the Slovenian Armed Forces, but this is reflected more in the weapon systems used by the Slovenian Armed Forces than in the personal equipment of members.” Purchasing of new equipment were halted years ago, no investment has been made in the military since year 2008, some vehicles are already 30 years old and are dilapidated despite regular maintenance, adds professor. In her opinion, in order to perform their tasks both at home and abroad, SAF members must not only be properly trained, but also equipped, which is the duty of the state. What will be funded by the new law? The Law on Provision of Funds for Investments in the Slovenian Army in the Years 2021 to 2026 was passed by the Parliament on November 20 2020. But does it actually take care of military shoes and basic equipment such as helmets? 780 million euro will be provided within next six years. Data taken from the The Law on Provision of Funds for Investments in the Slovenian Army in the Years 2021 to 2026. Only 4.6 % of 780 million euro worth of funding will be provided for infantry weapons and personal equipment of soldiers. And how much of that for shoes and helmets? In a bill, that was published on June 10 2020, it is stated: “As part of providing investments for infantry weapons in support, the law will provide funds in the event of replacement of key personal devices for military or personal weapons soldiers, provided that it introduces new equipment or weapons for the operation of members of the Slovenian Armed Forces.” The law is not stating specifically at any point about shoes and helmets. And even if we assume, that line “infantry weapons and personal equipment of soldiers” include them, this is only 4.6 % of the whole funding. Conclusion In short, both the Slovenian army force and expert Jelena Juvan agree, that Slovenian army is underfunded and in need of investments. But both stated, that shoes and helmets are not the biggest issue. Furthermore, the new law that was adopted provides no more than 4.6 % of whole funding for personal equipment and infantry weapons. We can conclude that the new law was not passed because of insufficient or lack of personal equipment of soldiers. Therefore, the statement of Alenka Jeraj is mostly false.

89;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-horror-fans-are-better-at-coping-during-the-global-pandemic/;“Horror fans are better at coping during the global pandemic”;2021-01-07;eufactcheck;;On 1 Octobre 2020, the Dutch edition of Vice magazine claimed that fans of horror movies show better psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. It based its claim on a study conducted by the university of Chicago, Pennsylvania State university and Aarhus university. The claim turns out to be mostly true. The study was conducted on 310 participants and occurred in April 2020. This was one month after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global pandemic. The study shows that fans of horror moviers are more likely to develop a certain resilience and better preparedness during a pandemic. The hypothesis of this study is that exposure to frightening, fictional stories allow audiences to practice effective coping strategies. These strategies can be beneficial when a similar situation occurs in the real world. Heading in Vice Magazine (20/10/01): Research says horror fans can better cope with the pandemic. Controlled environment When looking at this study from a psychological standpoint you will find that this claim is mostly true. The claim can be traced back to the counterconditioning effect. Counterconditioning is part of behavior analysis. This involves the conditioning of unwanted behavior. In its turn, this unwanted behavior will be conditioned, making the effect weaker or in some cases even positive. We checked this field of study with psychologist Olaf Spittaels, who confirmed this effect. Olaf Spittaels also explained the effect in this context. He clarified how this effect works exactly. If you look at the counterconditioning effect in this context you can easily correlate this effect with watching horror movies. Our brain can sense the danger and lethality of the virus. This will result in us being more aware and tense about the situation. When placing something threatening in our daily lives you get more anxious about this certain thing. This causes us to be more anxious about that certain situation. By experiencing fear in a controlled environment, your brain will put this response in perspective. By doing this a lot, the fear you felt initially will eventually become less apparent of might eventually disappear completely. When you frequently watch horror movies you will eventually become less susceptible to the fears connected to the genre. For example, watching a movie about a pandemic. Watching these types of movies will show you how other would handle this particular situation. The actors all face this fictional situation in different ways. By seeing how they react, you will actually learn how you should react in a similar situation. The information given in these types of movies can prove quite valuable when that same situation would happen in real life. By typing a similarity to the real world in these stories, the viewers will start imagining this happening in a real-life situation. Conclusion When you take all this information and look at the claim, you can conclude this claim is mostly true. Fears are experienced differently by different people. Some only need to be scared a couple of times for the effect to start working, others will never feel the effects of this experiment. However, this study does prove that people who have seen pandemics happen on the big screen are more resilient and less affected by the pandemic. Therefor this claim is mostly true.;https://www.vice.com/nl/article/5dzvez/horrorfans-kunnen-beter-omgaan-met-de-pandemie-blijkt-uit-onderzoek?fbclid=IwAR2dJpCUyhtDR_RDbyJ7qbNOqbPF8mbO8IRju3qGlUYtNKwZhqh8Dr5XzEU,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305882,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Schermafbeelding-2021-01-07-om-11.13.45.png,https://www.instagram.com/;“Horror fans are better at coping during the global pandemic”;;;;;;
90;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-government-measures-positively-affected-slovenian-employment-rating/;“Government measures positively affected Slovenian employment rating”;2021-01-04;eufactcheck;;"On 4 November 2020, Zdravko Počivalšek, Slovenian Minister of Economic Development and Technology, tweeted: “The assessments of the international financial institutions show that the measures taken so far have made it possible to maintain social stability and jobs.”  We rate this claim as mostly true. In a tweet from the official account of the Slovenian Minister of Economics Development and Technology, Zdravko Počivalšek, spoke about the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, specifically how the measures taken by the government positively affected Slovenian employment rating. After we contacted minister Počivalšek via e-mail, his team answered us rather quicky. Počivalšek’s team said that in the tweet the minister (who is also the author of the tweet) is referring to all economic and social measures that have been taken in order to help Slovenian economy. We point out just some of those measures for greater understanding in the next paragraph: Some of the measures taken by the government to mitigate the impact of the epidemic are as follows: those who lost their jobs during the epidemic receive temporary salary compensation; employers whose income will fall by more than 10 percent this year compared to 2019 are entitled to compensation of wages for workers; those self-employed whose income will fall by more than 10 percent this year compared to 2019 are entitled to a monthly basic income and exemption from social security contributions; students receive one-time solidarity aid in the amount of EUR 150; tourist vouchers for all residents of Slovenia (adults EUR 200, minors EUR 50), estimated at EUR 345 million; introduction of a mobile health protection application for informing about contacts with infected people; Partial coverage of fixed costs to the companies most affected by the epidemic etc. Credit rating agencies To explain coronavirus’s impact on Slovenian economy, we must begin with the fact that the Slovenian government has declared pandemic twice and offered help packages to certain economic subjects (the content of those packages was partly described in the previous paragraph). The indicators of economic activity in Slovenia have improved markedly since May and indicate a strong rebound in the third quarter, but in August and September the recovery already slowed considerably in most sectors. With the worsening of the epidemiological situation in September and October, confidence indicators indicate uncertainty about further recovery. The European Commission has forecast that Slovenia’s economy would contract by 7.1% this year, roughly on par with its previous estimate. A rebound of 5.1% is expected in 2021. However, as explained by his team – the claim made by minister Počivalšek was based on the assessments of the financial institutions, such as Fitch, Moody`s, DBRS Morningstar and Standard & Poor`s. A credit rating agency is a company that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor’s ability to pay back debt by making timely principal and interest payments and the likelihood of default. The government has posted all four on its official webpage, but as you can see if you open the following links – Fitch, Moody`s, DBRS Morningstar and Standard & Poor`s – there were just a few information. That is why we also checked original articles on webpages of original authors, which are hyperlinked in the first sentence. From that we could conclude that mentioned financial institutions had given Slovenia either a good stable rating or even improved it. As this does show overall good economic state that Slovenia is in – it does not necessarily reflect the state of unemployment and “social stability” as defined by Počivalšek’s team (in short: they claim social stability means that the income of the citizens had stayed more or less the same or has not drastically decreased). In Fitch ratings, it was stated that “The improving outlook is in part due to the effective containment measures that allowed a relatively short period of lockdown and to the authorities’ extensive support programmes”, and also added that “overall, we expect only a moderate increase in unemployment in 2020, to 6.8% from 4.5% in 2019, still well below the previous peak of 10.2% in 2013.” Which confirms what Počivalšek has claimed, although it has no mention of “social stability” (also no other research mentions social stability) as well as no undisputedly clear correlation between government measures and rate of unemployment. Two other assessments were not freely accessible, so we could not examine them further, and the fourth research had no mention of social stability or unemployment data.  A screenshot of the tweet by Zdravko Počivalšek, Slovenian Minister for of Economic Development and Technology  Employment ratings got better Because the first part did not give us enough relevant information to reach conclusions, we have reached out to Employment service of Slovenia, where we got some relevant data. At the start of the pandemic in Europe in spring, unemployment started to rise in Slovenia (see Figure 1). But then since July it started to drop and has been dropping ever since. Although the drop was not so fast as the rise, the official published numbers show, that it actually got better in the field of employment again. Figure 1 was generated on the basis of the data from the Website of Employment service of Slovenia.  Economist analysis Since we still did not have any information about improvement on the field of social stability, we also contacted economist and professor at the Faculty of Economic Ljubljana Jože P. Damijan, who is also candidate for prime minister in the possible upcoming technical government, supported by opposition parties. He said: “Počivalšek’s claim about jobs is true, since his analysis shows low correlation between the intensity of measures taken and growth of unemployment. Closing of public life and lockdown have not been followed by immediate growth of unemployment. Despite that manufacturing has been decreased because of the situation, people did not lose jobs. All that because the efficiency of the measures taken by a lot of governments, such as compensation at salary for those that are on standby from work, co-financing of firms and subsidizing of part-time work. That has given the employers the chance to keep their workers and not let them go. But this effects temporary and time limited, because government will not finance firms forever. So, when that stops, the firms will be forced to let workers go, especially at firms which will recover slowly. That is also the reason, that percent of unemployment raised till June and started falling afterwards.” Conclusion In short, the assessments of financial institutions, which we got during the research, have shown, that Slovenia got positive evaluation on field of economics. But it did not strictly connect with employment rates and social stability. Furthermore, additional research has shown, that field of unemployment actually got better, so we can conclude that it also upgraded social stability in the country. Still, information gained during process cannot confirm Počivalšek’s claim 100%. Therefore, we graded it as mostly true.

91;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-russian-academic-excellence/;“Russian universities fail to offer world class education”;2020-12-15;eufactcheck;;“Generation 0-100: Russian Universities Fail to Offer World Class Education” – our team found an article with this headline on the website of “The National Interest” magazine dated October 29, 2020. Indeed, Russian universities did not manage to get into the top 100 best universities in the world. However, higher educational institutions raised their positions in the overall ranking. The statement of the checked article can be regarded as mostly true. Part of a whole Ararat Osipian, the author of the material, a researcher at the Institute of International Education, claims that Russian universities are not able to provide a proper education and enter the 100 best educational institutions in the world. As an argument, he cites the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Project 5-100. The goal: at least five Russian universities should be among the top 100 best universities in the world by 2020. The material of Mr. Osipian contains some inaccurate data. Indeed, the official order of Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, of May 7, 2012 includes a clause stating that 5 Russian universities should enter the top hundred of the world’s leading universities according to world university rankings. But, this is only an aspect of the Decree “On measures to implement state policy in the field of education and science”. The source is the official site of the Project 5-100. As for the philosophy of the project, the goal of 5-100 – to maximize the competitive position of a group of leading Russian universities in the global market of educational services and research programs. World overall rankings Mr. Osipian also writes about the positions of Russian universities in the world ranking, noting that only 21 higher educational institutions were included in the top 500. However, the author did not analyze changes in the positions of universities with regard to other general authoritative rankings. Based on the material with information on the rankings of educational institutions on the Forbes Education website, one can trace how Russian universities appear and rise in the lists. The rankings to aim for are determined by the task of the project itself. These are the three most prestigious and authoritative rankings of universities in the world – Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), Times Higher Education (THE) and Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU or Shanghai ranking). – Times Higher Education included 400 Russian universities in 2015, and by 2020 – more than 1000. – ARWU more than doubled the number of participants: from 500 in 2016 to 1000 in 2019. – QS contained 800 universities in 2014, and 1000 in 2020. In addition, the dynamics of Russian universities is mostly positive, as evidenced by the charts compiled by rankings. Dynamics of Russian Universities in QS World University Rankings. Source: QS World University Rankings Dynamics of Russian Universitie in Shanghai World University Rankings. Source: Forbes Russia Dynamics of Russian Universitie in Times Higher World University Rankings. Source: Forbes Russia Rankings by Subject Another omission of the author is Subject Rankings. Ararat Osipian relies only on the general summary, but claims about the failure of universities in general. In turn, Russian universities improve their performance not only by the quantity, but also by the quality of individual subject areas.  According to the source, the number of Russian universities in the top 100 best universities in the world under the version of the Shanghai Subject Ranking (ARWU) has grown from six to eight (the ranking was updated in 2019). In total, this list includes 15 Russian universities. It should be noted that the Shanghai ranking includes more than 4,000 universities in the world in 54 subjects in such areas of knowledge as Natural and Engineering Sciences, Life Sciences, Medical and Social Sciences. For example, the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, which moved from position 151-200 to position 101-150, and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, which moved from position 201-300 to 151-200, demonstrated significant growth in the area of Physics. Among the newly added universities that were included in the ranking are Tomsk Polytechnic University, which took position 76-100 in the subject area “Mechanical Engineering”, and ITMO University – position 76-100 in the subject area “Automation and Control”. There were outsiders too, of course. For example, MSU dropped one position in the subject ranking in Physics, taking 45th place, and left the 51-75 group, taking 76-100 in the field of “Mathematics”. The overall dynamics in the ranking is positive, and Russian universities continue to increase their performance and hone their subject areas. Conclusion In short, our research has shown that the statement “Russian universities fail to offer world class education” is mostly true. The author of the article in The National Interest magazine outlined the point of the request not as a part, but as a whole, which is not entirely correct. Another important omission was that the author formed a limited perception about the development of Russian universities due to the fact that he did not take into account the subject rankings of world universities.

92;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-the-highest-number-of-tests-in-romania-was-done-in-november/;“The highest number of tests in Romania was done in November”;2020-12-15;eufactcheck;;During a TV interview, aired on December 3rd, 2020, on Digi24, the former Prime Minister of Romania, Ludovic Orban, stated that during the month of November, there have been more COVID-19 tests done than in previous months. This statement is true, according to official statistics. Context Ludovic Orban, leader of the National Liberal Party, was designated Prime Minister of Romania by President Klaus Iohannis in October 2019, after the fall of Viorica Dăncilă’s Government. Three months later, the Liberal government was dismissed via a censor-motion. Given the pandemic circumstances, a new cabinet, once again led by Orban, was approved in March. His cabinet was in charge of handling the health crisis in Romania. Ludovic Orban resigned in December, due to his party receiving a lower-than-expected number of votes at the parliamentary election. Orban’s claims Not long before resigning from his position of Prime-Minister of Romania, Ludovic Orban claimed that, during the month of November, there have been more COVID tests done, compared to previous months. He proceeded to say that the number of infections has been decreasing, even though, at the beginning of the month, Romania reached a record of over 10.000 daily cases. Orban`s claim comes after general criticism regarding the low testing rate on one hand, and president Iohannis` statement that mass-testing has no proven effects, on the other hand. Moreover, Ludovic Orban stated, on Novermber 17th, that Romania has a capacity of 53.000-54.000 daily tests, but this threshold is not achieved, because there are not so many requests. Ludovic Orban`s claim, in an article published by Digi24, after the live interview “I can give you some data from memory: in June, there were about 240.000-250.000 tests, in September there were more than 400.000 tests, and the highest number of tests was done in November”, Orban told the public during the TV interview. These claims can be checked by consulting the official daily statistics and reports, published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), the Group for Strategic Communication, and other reliable sources. Official data and statistics First of all, it is important to understand how the Romanians get tested. There are two main testing procedures: on-demand tests, which can be done by anyone and cost about 40 euro, and health protocol tests, which can be done for free if someone comes in contact with a person that tested positive, but only if they have symptoms. Ludovic Orban claimed that, during the month of June, the test count was somewhere between 240.000 and 250.000. This can be checked by using the daily reports published on social media by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to their posts, between the beginning of the pandemic and the 1st of June 2020, there have already been 443.252 tests done. If we check the statistics for the last day of the same month, the 30th of June, the official reports show that the test count was at 710.112. By doing the math, we can learn that, in June, 266.860 COVID-19 tests have been done. There is a difference of at least 16.860 tests between Orban’s claim and official reports. Using the same method, the data for September and November also confirms the claims. The former Prime Minister said that there have been more than 400.000 tests done in September. Official statistics show that there have actually been 594.419 tests (from 1.825.272 on September 1st, to 2.419.691 on September 30th), proving Orban’s claim about the tests done in September to be true. Even though Ludovic Orban was mostly right about the number of tests made during the months of June and September, the question still remains: has the highest number of monthly tests been done in November? The data shows that, in November, 843.263 tests have been processed (from 3.264.304 on November 1st, to 4.107.567 on November 30th). For comparison, during the month of October, 797.260 COVID-19 tests have been done. Therefore, the highest number of tests in Romania was done in November. The following chart, published on covid19.geo-spatial.org, depicts the evolution of daily tests in Romania, since the beginning of the pandemic. As the data shows, most of the tests were done in November, with a total of 864.819 tests. Screenshot of the dynamic of COVID-19 tests in Romania, since the beginning of the pandemic The difference, compared to MIA data, may be caused by the fact that Coronavirus COVID-19 Romania takes into consideration several sources: The Ministry of Internal Affairs, county public health directorates, county hospitals, public statements by the various representatives of the relevant national, regional and local authorities. Conclusion Ludovic Orban’s claims about the number of monthly tests are true. The former Prime Minister’s statements match the reports and statistics released by The Ministry of Internal Affairs and official global data, proving that November was, indeed, the moth with the most COVID-19 tests done in Romania.

93;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-scientists-leftovers-of-contraceptive-pills-go-to-water-and-poison-the-environment/;“Scientists;2020-12-13;eufactcheck;;On the website of TVP Info, the Polish public television news channel has been published an article entitled “Scientists: leftovers of contraceptive pills go to water and poison the environment”. Due to the very complex nature of this topic our team decided to focus on two key statements from this article. First of all: “Research shows that even a small amount of ethinylestradiol – a synthetic estrogen used in most oral contraceptives – that ends up in water, has a negative effect on aquatic organisms and the fish exposed to it have fewer offspring” – in referring to research published by  Dr. Latonya Jackson from University of Cincinnati Secondly: “In his book “Troubled Water: What’s Wrong with What We Drink”, published last year, (Seth) Siegel notes that scientists do not yet know if what is harmful to fish can also have a negative impact on people.” Both statements turned out to be true Statement number one In the case of the first statement, we were able to determine its compatibility with the results of the referred research. The source material was an article published by Dr. Latonya Jackson in the scientific journal “Aquatic Toxicology”. Both the journal’s quite high impact factor (3.884) and the number of citation of the scientist (302 according to Research Gate) indicate her reliability as a source. Thanks to the politeness of the author we also gained access to the source research paper: “Impact of Long-Term Exposure to 17α-Ethinylestradiol in the Live-Bearing Fish Heterandria formosa” Conclusions contained in there matches those described by polish news portal. Also after comparing the statistical data we did not find any irregularities in the numbers given by TVP Info. “This study showed that in least killifish continuous EE2 exposure affected growth and sexual development of both males and females, strongly reduced reproduction, and greatly reduced survival in the second generation” Other research teams confirmed the results published by a group of Cincinnati University scientists. The presence of Ethinylestradiol (EE2) was also detected in river waters near Sao Paulo (Environmental Monitoring and Assessment volume 192, Article number: 21 (2020)) Also scientist from Argentina Universidad  has drawn attention to the issue of poor EE2 detection in river waters (“Novel  electrochemical  paper-based  immunocapture  assay  for  the  quantitative determination of ethinylestradiol in water samples” ASC Publications) In Poland there was conducted a similar test to examine the influence of EE2 to water organisms. Dr. Katarzyna Affek and Dr. Monika Załęska-Radziwiłł (Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Environmental Engineering, Department of Biology) conducted a series of tests described in publication “Biodegradation of 17α-ethinylestradiol and ecotoxicity studies of its biochemical degradation metabolites” [1] The control group included crustaceans showing fluorescence, bioluminescent bacteria and fish. However, the researchers reserve that their results should be treated as preliminary and EE2 was found to degrade during a period of 28 days. In a quite high concentration of EE2 they observed an increase in crustacean mortality and permanent loss of fluorescent ability Statement number two The article also refers to the words of Seth Siegel, who is afraid whether what is harmful to fish may also have a bad effect on human health. Seth Siegel is businessman, activist and author of the book “Let there be water” which was noted as a bestseller by New York Times and The Washington Post in 2015.  Article is referring to findings contained in his latest book: “Troubled Water: What’s Wrong with What We Drink”. After a closer look at this book and chapter six “Pills in the water” we found out that it matches the statement described in the article. “While it isn’t clear what the long-term consequences of these chemicals in our drinking water will be, common sense suggests that it would be wise to limit it or, if possible, to prevent it.” ~Seth Siegel “Troubled Water” p.78 Author relays on reports and research of multiple experts like Dr. Luke Iwanowicz – author of publication “Evidence of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruption in Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass Inhabiting Northeast U.S. National Wildlife Refuge Waters: A Reconnaissance Study,” Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety 124 (February 2016): 51–58. After studying the effects of estrogen on water organisms Dr. Iwanowicz draws attention to the problem of possible contamination of drinking water by pharmaceuticals. “What we are beginning to understand,” Iwanowicz says, “is that there may actually be an impact below ‘No Effect.’ … Ultra-low doses of estrogen, and also other drugs designed for a different purpose [that are getting into drinking water], could be causing hormonal disruption with effects on reproductive and sexual health, but from drug levels far lower than earlier imagined.” ~Dr. Luke Iwanowicz (interview with an author) In the footnotes, we can read the author’s comment, who claims that “The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, §1457 (“Estrogenic Substances Screening Program,” 42 U.S.C. §300j-17) provided the EPA with the power to require testing of estrogenic substances. Despite having this authority, the EPA has done little or nothing to test the effect of them.” “A March 2008 study (AP Finds Prescription Drugs in Drinking Water, Water and Wastes Digest, March 10, 2008.) that checked the drinking water of twenty-eight major metropolitan U.S. regions found pharmaceutical products in the drinking water of twenty-four of them, putting 41 million people at risk” – adds Seth Siegiel Author explains that the main reason for this situation is that up to 90% of the pills are not digested and after flushing in the toilet they start to travel in the second circuit. (Leigh Boerner, “The Complicated Question of Drugs in the Water: Pharmaceuticals—Inescapable in Medicine—Are Increasingly Prevalent in Our Drinking Water. But Is That a Problem?,” NOVA, May 14, 2014) Considering that Americans take much more drugs than in previous years (Atlanta: US Department of Health and Human Services, 2017)  the scale of this issue seems to be large enough to be concerned. Conclusion Despite the alarming tone of the headline and recent bad reputation of TVP info as a source of information the content of the article turned out to be true. There were no misinformation in matter of statistical data, transleted quotations and mentioned conclusions of scientists. Studies, related to first statement, has been recognized as credible within the scientific community and quoted in respected journals. If it comes to the second statement Seth Siegiel’s words were correctly paraphrased. After closer look to his book we found out that there are numerous evidence of contraceptive pills (as well as other pharmaceuticals) are posing a potential threat not only for environment but also human health.

According to the article, people with this blood group therefore run a higher risk of serious symptoms when infected with the coronavirus. This conclusion came from an international study. The Belgian Red Cross-Flanders calls the study “very high quality”. The claim turns out to be mostly true. The DNA of 1 610 Italian and Spanish hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory problems was compared to the DNA of 2200 healthy people by a group of international researchers led by German and Norwegian researchers. This is not the first study to show that individuals with blood type A have a higher risk of developing serious coronavirus symptoms. Chinese (here and here) and American (and here) studies came to the same conclusion. People with blood type A have a higher chance of a positive coronavirus test. Why blood type O protects better against Covid-19 is still unclear. Possibly it has to do with a coagulation factor, which people with this blood group have less of. Article on vrtnws.be, the Belgian public broadcaster Other factors However, it is not known yet how exactly the blood group could play a role in a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Too few target groups have yet been studied and other factors must be taken into account. It may be a coincidence that more people with blood group A test positive for the coronavirus and show more severe symptoms. Other factors that cause this may also be overlooked. Every culture is different, and so every culture has its own lifestyle. This lifestyle causes larger groups in the same society to create certain health changes in the body. The blood group not only plays a major role in the fact that more people test positive for the coronavirus, but other factors in the body are also important. These other factors include, for example, your weight, age, medication you take, chronic respiratory and pulmonary abnormalities, and so on. So, your lifestyle as an individual is also very important and plays a major role (your diet, sports pattern, etc.). In addition, it is also about an observational examination, which cannot show a cause-effect relationship. More research “In order to know whether blood type A is really the cause of the increased risk of serious symptoms of corona, more research is needed”, says Nena Testelmans of the Flemish Red Cross. The examination should take into account all other important factors of the body that increase the risk of serious coronavirus symptoms. A person with blood type A who has chronic abnormalities of the respiratory tract and lungs as a result of smoking all his life is more likely to have corona because of his state of health and not just because of the fact that this person has blood type A. Every important factor must therefore be taken into account. In addition, more people need to be examined. If more countries are examined, it is possible to take into account the possibility of reacting differently to the coronavirus. A conclusion can only be drawn when a more extensive and thorough investigation is done. Conclusion  What is stated in the article is largely correct. In the research, people with blood type A were the largest target group that tested positive for the coronavirus or showed more severe symptoms due to the virus. What can be discussed, however, is the fact that there is an immediate link between the chance of getting the coronavirus and a person’s blood type. It is not the intention to frighten people unnecessarily, because too little research has been done that really shows that the blood group plays a major role in the coronavirus. It can therefore be concluded that more people with blood type A really showed more severe symptoms of the coronavirus, but a more thorough and extensive research is clearly needed to be able to make a connection between Covid-19 and the blood type.

95;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-there-are-about-400-employees-working-at-slovenian-ministry-of-culture/;“There are about 400 employees working at Slovenian Ministry of Culture.”;2020-12-10;eufactcheck;;The leader of the Slovenian National Party (SNS), Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti, stated that there are 400 employees at the Ministry of Culture and that almost 30 years ago there were only around 40. The number of employees claimed during the special session of the Slovenian Parliament Jelinčič’s, is almost two times bigger than the actual number of workers at the ministry and its institutes. On 2 November 2020 Slovenian parliament held a special session on behalf of the opposition parties LMŠ (List of Marjan Šarec), Levica (The Left), SD (Social democrats) and SAB (Party of Alenka Bratušek). The main topics were governmental interventions and staffing changes in public institutions, which were, as opposition parties stated, brutal and as such interfered with independence of these institutions.  Government was supposedly replacing personnel with people connected to the four parties that form Slovenian government coalition and were named for political purposes and intentions. Meanwhile, coalition was defending these staffing decisions by stating that important positions require competent personnel and that these changes were necessary. SNS (Slovenian National Party) agreed with that standpoint. SNS, although not a direct part of coalition, continues to support and cooperate with most of coalition decisions on behalf of a special deal. The party is also known for their strong and often controversial position. As stated in their program, SNS is for withdrawal of Slovenia from the European Union and NATO, they specifically oppose any immigration from Asia or Africa. SNS is also against gay marriage and even if they claim to respect any Slovenian traditional religion, they are against Islam and also against building any “foreign religion” in Slovenia. Zmago Jelinčič is the leader of this party, and he presented their standpoint about staffing decisions. He emphasized his full support of these changes, assessing that previous personnel had been incompetent and as such, a burden to our country. He then assessed that there are too many employees on some ministries in our country and they end up working there, because they cannot find some other suitable workplace for them. After that, the statement that we have focused on followed: And then we have a situation, where the Ministry of Culture, which in 1992 had maybe a little over 40 employees, today has about 400 (of them).” – Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti, Slovenian National Party, during the Parliament session on 2 November 2020 (1:32:00–1:32:12) Printscreen of the Parliament session broadcasted by the public Television Slovenia: Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti. Source: RTV SLO, 2 November 2020. Employees at Ministry of Culture We contacted the Ministry of Culture and asked them to provide us with the exact numbers of employees over the years. They divide their employees into three distinctive groups. Those, that are employed directly at ministry, those who work in the Archive of Republic of Slovenia, and those who work for the Inspectorate of Republic of Slovenia for Culture and Media. We received three sets of numbers from year 2004 until this year with exception of period from April 2012 until the end of May 2013, in which the Ministry of Culture was a part of Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports. On 19 November 2020 there were 157 people employees working directly at Ministry of Culture. 69 workers were employed at the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia and eight people were employed at the Inspectorate for Culture and Media. Together this brings it to 234 regular workers, which is far from the Jelinčič’s number of about 400. This visualisation was made by the authors on the basis of the data provided by the Slovenian Ministry of Culture. This table was made by the authors on the basis of the data provided by the Slovenian Ministry of Culture. We have also asked the Ministry of culture to provide us with the numbers of irregular workers. On 19 November there was one non-standard worker working for the ministry. The contract is valid from 28 October 2020 until 27 August 2021. There are also four students working for the ministry. If we add these numbers to the number of regular workers we are still far from 400, at 239 workers. Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti: Go count again We have contacted the author of the statement Jelinčič for his response as well. We wanted to know who or what was the source for the stated numbers. This was his response: ‘’I suggest that you go count again, how many people are employed (directly) at Ministry of culture and at positions that are a part of Ministry of culture.’’ Conclusion In short, the numbers that the leader of the political party SNS Zmago Jelinčič stated during his speech are incorrect – there are no 400 employees working at Slovenian Ministry of Culture at this moment. Official data includes regular and irregular workers, employed directly at ministry or at institution that is part of ministry and we even added student workers. The correct number is 239 which is significantly less than the number stated by Jelinčič. His statement is false.

96;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-international-studies-show-that-men-get-higher-profits-from-a-scientific-paper-than-women/;international studies show that men get higher profits from a scientific paper than women;2020-12-08;eufactcheck;;In an interview with Stern.de, German economist Claudia Kemfert claims that international studies show that, for example, a male author benefits more from a scientific paper than a female author. This claim can be classified as “True”. The interview with Ms. Kemfert was published as part of a campaign by the German medium Stern under the motto “We are quota women“. In the interview series, 40 women from various top positions in German society explain how the women’s quota would benefit everyone. One of these women is Claudia Kemfert. Kemfert is a German economist who has headed the department “Energy, Transportation, Environment” at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) since 2004. Moreover, she is Professor of Energy Economics and Energy Policy at the Leuphana University Lüneburg. She has also been a member of the Club of Rome’s Presidium since 2016.       „The quota for women is like using glasses: first it is annoying and then it improves the eyesight“, Claudia Kempfert said to the German medium Stern. Women’s quota in Germany According to the DIW,  a women’s quota is a gender quota which determines that women or men must be represented in a certain minimum proportion on committees such as the executive or supervisory boards of companies bound by the quota. In Germany, a gender quota of 30 percent has been in force in supervisory boards of listed and parity codetermined companies since 2016. If the proportion in a company is less than 30 percent, vacant positions must be given to women until the quota is met. In addition to Germany, there are nine other countries in Europe with a statutory quota for women. These include Norway, France, Belgium and Italy. Underrepresentation of women in science According to the Leipniz-Institut for social science the data collection for the women quota in science started back in 1980. They distinguish between habilitation, vocation and professorship as well as professorship in pay grade C4/W3.  Looking at the numbers of habilitation from 1980 until 2019, the percentage of women increased from 4.5 percent to almost 32 percent and increased more than sixfold.  The data collection for vocation started back in 1997 with not even 20 percent and increased up to 37 percent in 2019.  Regarding the numbers of professorship and professorship in pay grade C4/W3, they started increasing continuous since 1990. Here, too, the percentage of women quadrupled since 1990.  This data shows the access for women in leading positions in science. A continuous increase of the percentage of women, especially in professorship, started since the 1990s.  Despite the trending increase there is still an underrepresentation of women in the leading positions in science. If the linear increase of the last 20 years resumes the same, the gender balance in professorship will be received in 50 years. Compared to the EU, “in 2018, of almost 15 million scientists and engineers in the EU, 59% were men and 41% women”, referring to the statistical office of the European Union. Men were particularly overrepresented in manufacturing with 79%, while the gender ratio in the services sector was more balanced with 54% male and 46% female.  However, in four EU Member States, including Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia and Denmark, the majority of scientists and engineers were women.  In contrast, less than one third of scientists and engineers were women in Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg and Germany.    The citation gap between women and men and its consequences  The Cambridge University Press published a study about the Gender citation gap in international relations. They analysed the citation and publication pattern in 3000 articles published between 1980 and 2006 in international relations literature in a peer reviewed journal. This study confirms that there is a citation gap between women and men and women get systematically less cited than men.  Women tend to cite themselves less than men and men tend to cite men more often than women. Furthermore men are more productive in terms of quantity while women tend to release Articles with higher quality. The citation gap is a concern especially for women that haven’t earned tenure yet.  The study also explains why the citation gap is a problem, citations are one of the most important measurements for quality in science.  The number of citations are important criteria for quality and influence of an author so it is also important to earn tenure. But the number of citations is not only important for the individual scholar but also for journals and institutions. It influences decisions about the distribution resources for a department including salary, it is an indicator for the excellence at a global level for institutions and determines the comparison between faculty departments across universities. Conclusion In short, the claim is true since the count of citations is important to determine quality and influence of an author and important to earn tenure in a scientific field, which influences future career options. Yes, men do profit from a scientific paper, more than women. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

97;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-pfizer-waited-on-purpose-to-announce-the-news-about-the-vaccine-after-u-s-elections/;Pfizer waited on purpose to announce the news about the vaccine after U.S. elections;2020-12-07;eufactcheck;;Did Pfizer wait on purpose? After the US elections, a prominent Croatian RTL TV news anchor Zoran Šprajc, made a comment in  one of the most watched news shows in Croatia called RTL Direkt, assuming that the bio-pharmaceutical company Pfizer waited on purpose for the end of the elections to publish news about the vaccine against Covid-19. However, Pfizer gave reliable data and reasons for the exact date of publishing the results. Therefore, Mr Šprajc’s statement is assessed as false.  Anchor’s intro in the Croatian news show RTL Direkt in November was as follows: “And if you’re wondering why Pfizer waited for the U.S. election to be over to announce this sensationally good news, let’s also recall the fact that Trump forced the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices, and thus knocked out billions of dollars in profits, so they weren’t really  interested to announce the news on the eve of the election. On the other hand, we can expect that the new US administration will know how to return the favour to the pharmaceutical industry, and the American brothers will probably soon pay dearly for their medicines again.” In this claim, the RTL (Croatian TV channel which is part of the RTL group) anchor Zoran Šprajc, used his role as a host of the popular news show, to speculate on the basis of the president Trump’s claims in which he accused pharmaceutical industry Pfizer for waiting on purpose with the results, although it was him who invested in the research of vaccine through the operation Warp Speed. Research Pfizer and BioNTech released the first results of a study on the COVID-19 vaccine on November 9th, confirming that the results of the group that received the vaccine compared to the one that received placebo were positive in more than 90 percent of cases. As the results of the third phase were announced some days after the US election held on 3rd November, the press release was a trigger for the series of attacks coming from President Trump who refused acknowledging Joe Biden’s victory. Furthermore, the vaccine announcement was a trigger for number of President Trump’s posts attacking pharmaceutical company Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which could be found on Trump’s Twitter profile. One of them is: “As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn’t have the courage to do it before. Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives! None of Trump’s tweets are evidence-based.  It is important to mention that President Trump often repeated in public that the vaccine would be ready for use before the election. This could be interpreted as an attempt to secure more votes in his favour. Also, his daughter Ivanka Trump, his son, Donald Trump Jr., Vice President Mike Pence, and radio host Mark Levin were among those publicly celebrating the news about the vaccine as a victory of president’s Operation Warp Speed. Mike Pence tweeted that the news about vaccine came “thanks to the public-private partnership forged” by Mr Trump. Warp Speed is an agreement between US government and pharmaceutical companies in order to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.  In July, it was announced that up to $1.95 billion in funds will be given to Pfizer for the large-scale manufacturing and nationwide distribution of 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate. According to Business Insider, that means that Warp Speed bought 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccines before the results came in. Still, on 8th November, Pfizer claimed it wasn’t part of the operation. “We were never part of the Warp Speed,” the Pfizer Vice President Kathrin Jansen said to New York Times “We have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.”   After Pfizer’s initial claim to the New York Times that it had never been part of Operation Warp Speed,   Pfizer Spokesperson Sharon Castello’s email statement to CNN says it is not entirely true. „”Pfizer is one of various vaccine manufacturers participating in Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine,” Castillo said: “While Pfizer did reach an advanced purchase agreement with the U.S. government, the company did not accept (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) funding for the research and development process. All the investment for R&D was made by Pfizer at risk. Dr Jansen was emphasizing that last point.” Although it is true that they signed a distribution agreement with the US government for the purpose of improving availability of vaccines, Pfizer said they invested their own money into research. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained the reason behind that decision for CBS News on 13th September for not taking US tax-payers money for the research: “The reason why I did it was because I wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy. When you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. I didn’t want to have any of that. I wanted them- basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way”.  Also on the 13th of November, President Trump gave an update on the Operation Warp Speed,  still insisting that Pfizer was misinterpreting the fact: “Pfizer said it wasn’t part of Warp Speed, but that turned out to be a unfortunate misrepresentation.  They are part.  That’s why we gave them the $1.95 million — billion dollars.  And it was an unfortunate mistake that they made when they said that.“ Even though Pfizer stuck to the fact that they never took US federal money for the research, it was not entirely true that they were not part of the Operation Speed at all.  Obviously, there is more nuance in the Pfizer – US Government relationship. According to the CNN Factcheck, if the company had a major agreement to sell at least 100 doses of its vaccine to the federal government and Pfizer acknowledged, this can be be interpreted as „participating“ in Operation Warp Speed through this deal. But this doesn’t prove the assumption that Pfizer and BioNTech waited on purpose. Those who think that Pfizer was waiting to announce the results after the election, also rely on earlier statements by Pfizer CEO Albert Burla. In an interview with the NBC Today Show on 8th September, Bourla said that that Pfizer would only submit a vaccine for authorization “when we have evidence of safety and efficacy.” He predicted that Pfizer would have an answer by the end of October 2020. On 27th October Burla ruled out that they would have a vaccine ready before election date.  According to Burla, they still lacked trial data and had not yet reached the number of 32 cases out of 44.000 participants reported cases of infection among participants. These data arrived on 5th or 6th November, and then an independent committee of experts analyzed all the characteristics of the vaccine and the data obtained from the research. On 18th November, at the New York Times press conference, almost 2 weeks after the US election, CEO Burla stated clearly “We didn’t conspire with anyone. (…) We didn’t delay vaccine results until after elections”. To verify the claim, on 11th November,  the online publication  Science, made a factcheck on all steps in the process and found no evidence for claims that vaccine result was surpressed to sway elections. Another speculation linked to the claim we are factchecking, is given in the same intro by the RTL Direkt host Mr Zoran Šprajc. He says that the reason for the delay of the vaccine announcement is the fact that Trump’s administration forced the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices and thus knocked out billions of dollars in profits. for this, according to Mr Šprajc, they didn’t want to announce the news on the eve of the election.   The anchor then speculates that the new US administration would return the favor to the pharmaceutical industry by rising drug prices again. According to some factchecks quoted by NBC news,  there’s no evidence that Trump’s policies have meaningfully lowered drug prices, as he has repeatedly claimed. The RTL Direkt anchor made a speculation that Pfizer waited to announce the vaccine results because they expected the financial award from the new US Government. The comment was not based on any previous research. Also, no TV story followed this introduction by the anchor that would give more information and background for Mr Šprajc’s claims.   Conclusion The comment given in the RTL Direkt news by the prominent anchor Zoran Šprajc is therefore false. Pfizer clearly stated the reasons for announcing the results on that particular day and the company distanced itself from political influence. With all speculative hints of Trump and his supporters on Twitter, it can be dangerous to pass on a story without checking facts. Pfizer explained even before the election day that the result of the research could be delayed and there was no reason to link them to political calculations. Even more, the host of the show used his position to make further speculations assuming that the reasons for the delay is the pharmaceutical industry expectations that the new US Government would award them with the rise of the drug prices. For the host of one of the most watched news shows in the country it is irresponsible to make such assumption without any backup.  RTL Direkt news show has a wide audience and the comments of the popular host are often shared.  After the show, many smaller web portals and social networks published and shared the video with Zoran Šprajc’s comment. Such speculations can create a stigmatized image of the new vaccine and jeopardize the already shaken public confidence in the pharmaceutical industry caused by numerous conspiracy theories.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Vera Kadijević & Josipa Mandurić;https://www.rtl.hr/vijesti-hr/korona/3922706/evo-zasto-je-pfizer-cekao-kraj-izbora-sigurno-ce-braca-amerikanci-znati-uzvratiti-uslugu/,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-covid-vaccine-a-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel.html,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325961445062938625,https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/1325794339335921667,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/22/us-government-engages-pfizer-produce-millions-doses-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/operation-warp-speed-us-coronavirus-vaccine-program-pfizer-moderna-2020-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/fact-check-pfizer-warp-speed-pence/index.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-pfizer-ceo-dr-albert-bourla-on-face-the-nation-september-13-2020/,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/fact-check-pfizer-warp-speed-pence/index.html,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-update-our-us-covid-19-vaccine-candidate,https://www.today.com/video/pfizer-ceo-on-coronavirus-vaccine-we-will-have-an-answer-by-the-end-of-october-91234885714,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-pfizer-election-idINKBN27X2N3,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/fact-check-no-evidence-supports-trump-s-claim-covid-19-vaccine-result-was-suppressed,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html,https://www.instagram.com/;Pfizer waited on purpose to announce the news about the vaccine after U.S. elections;;;;;;

More interesting was the fact that this statement was made about seizures of heroin: “The increase in seizures of heroin in the EU is mainly due to an increase in seizures in the port of Antwerp”. This claims turns out to be mostly true. Knack used the figures from the EMCDDA, the agency of the European Union that monitors drug traffic. Their reports are openly available on the internet. The report turned out to have a different result than the one in the article of Knack, because the number of seizures had decreased, instead of increased.  Increasing amounts The drug figures in the EMCDDA reports were misleading because it showed the opposite of the claim. There were less intercepted seizures, so why would Knack say that the increase in the EU was due to an increase in the Port of Antwerp? It seemed like the claim was already busted. Nevertheless, more research was needed to investigate this claim. Source: ECMDDA More important figures are the ones that clarify the evolution in the amount of intercepted heroin. The research clearly showed that the number of intercepted kilos had increased enormously. In 1 year time, the amount had almost increased by one hundred times. An increase that is quite remarkable when you see that the number of interceptions has decreased anyway. In the graph, there is a clear increase that could not be explained by the figures in the report. Source: ECMDDA Two experts provide their expertise and explanation on this claim and ensure that there is a logical end point to complete this claim. Experts Kathryn Robinson, Head of Sector, Media Relations and Marketing and Communication Unit at ECMDDA  points out the importance of context.“It is not unusual to see total quantities seized suddenly increase due to a few large seizures , as occured in Antwerp. Belgium seized more than 4,5 tonnes of heroïn, compared with only 53 kilos in the previous year. This was the main reason for such an important increase in the quantity of heroïn seized in the EU. The quantity of heroïn seized in other countries fluctuated within the normal decade ranges.“  “So yes, the statement is correct. But without context, the claim is misleading. If you would only look at the amount of seizures, you would not be able to tell that the claim is true. By looking at the intercepted quantity in kg’s , things get a lot more clear.”  A couple of seizures with amounts above 100 kilograms made sure that Belgium is the main reason why there is such an increase in the EU. There is even 1 interception of 870 kilograms of heroin, which is one of the largest shipments ever. Else De Donder, staff member study & research at VAD (the Flemish expertise center for alcohol, illegal drugs, psychoactive medication, gambling and gaming) compares the Belgian and the Spanish context. In Spain, the number of seizures is much higher than in Belgium (almost 10 times more). However, the amount intercepted is always lower than in Belgium, which means that there are (some) larger catches in Belgium. The statement in the press points to the intercepted quantity which is indeed higher in Belgium and due to some extremely large catches in the port of Antwerp. I understand that there is confusion when one reads the statement and puts it next to the numbers. Therefore it is important that there is always a clear explanation when talking about this type of content. Conclusion The figures in Belgium are going steadily. Every year more and more drugs are intercepted in the EU, and the port of Antwerp is clearly the main player. In short, if you look at the figures, it is clear that the claim is true. Although the wording could certainly be a bit clearer. One should take into account the amount of kilos in the article when talking about an increase. Otherwise it’s not immediately clear to the reader what kind of increase it’s really about.

Screen capture from the interview in Italian newspaper La Repubblica 23 November 2020 According to official European Commission press releases, the EC reached 5 agreements with the pharmaceutical companies related to 5 different vaccine projects so far, ensuring a sufficient amount of vaccine doses for the entire EU population. The first agreement, reached with AstraZeneca (SVE-GB) and Oxford University (GB), was signed on the 27th August 2020 and guarantees 300 million doses to the EU Member States, plus other supplementary 100 million doses. The second agreement, reached with Sanofi (ITA)- GSK (GB), was signed on the 18th September 2020 and will provide an amount of 300 million doses.  The third agreement was reached with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (BEL), one of the Johnson&Johnson societies. This contract will ensure 200 million doses, plus other supplementary 200 million doses. The fourth agreement will allow the EU to buy 200 million vaccine doses from BioNTech (DE) and Pfizer (USA). This particular vaccine was recently claimed to be 95% efficient. There’s also the possibility to buy other 100 million doses. The fifth agreement guarantees 225 million vaccine doses from CureVac (DE), plus other supplementary 180 million doses. The last three agreements have been approved by the EU Commission, yet they haven’t been officially signed. The sixth vaccine Sassoli is referring to, instead, is the one produced by the American pharmaceutical company Moderna, with whom the EU Commission already started to discuss an agreement. On the 16th November, after the company announced a 94,5% effectiveness of its vaccine, The EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, declared that an official contract will be hopefully defined soon. Visualisation by  Alessandra Petrini, Luigi Scarano, Davide Cavalleri, Francesca Canto, Annarosa Laureti, Catholic University of Milan, Italy   Moreover, the pre-agreement with Moderna includes the purchase of a maximum of 160 million doses (divided into two parts of 80 doses each), which is less than the 200 million doses per vaccine pointed out by Sassoli. Additional note: the effective number of vaccine doses, pre-ordered by the EU Commission for each EU Member State, is higher than the 446 million citizens of the EU. However, it is possible that part of the doses will be given to the lower-middle-income countries or will be redistributed to other European countries. In conclusion Therefore, we can conclude that Sassoli’s statement is mostly true: on the one hand, the EU reached 6 agreements with 6 pharmaceutical companies; on the other hand, only 5 of the agreements officially entered into force and will provide a minimum of 200 doses.

100;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-in-croatia-there-are-fewer-deaths-during-the-pandemic-than-last-year/;In Croatia there are fewer deaths during the pandemic than last year;2020-11-24;eufactcheck;;"Prominent internationally recognized Croatian scientist Miroslav Radman claims that in Croatia there are 967 fewer deaths ”at this time“ compared to last year, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. While Mr Radman does not specify in his claim to what period he specifically is referring to, stats from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics – which he quotes – show us that between March 2020, when the pandemic was officially declared, and September 2020; Croatia has had more deaths than in the same period last year. Therefore, Mr Radman’s statement is assessed as false. In an interview for a Croatian evening TV news show RTL Direkt, Miroslav Radman spoke about the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. He said: “When I look at the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, it is apparent that at this time of the year there were 967 fewer deaths than at the same time last year. A man of common sense then wonders where such a terrible problem lies.“ Considering the situation in the world and the presence of fear around the pandemic we deemed it necessary to check the credibility of Mr Radman’s statement.  Stats…but from which period? Since Mr Radman did not specify what period of the year he is referring to, we assumed that he was talking about the period between March and September 2020. In Croatia the pandemic was officially declared in March, while September was the last month with published stats at the time when Mr Radman was a guest in the mentioned TV evening news show and made this claim. In order to check the claim, the Croatian Bureau of Statistics – that Mr Radman quotes in his claim – was contacted. As their data on the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on socioeconomic show, the number of deaths from March to September of 2020 increased by 2.4% compared to the same period last year.  The numbers don’t add up There have been 688 more deaths in the mentioned period this year. The rise of Covid-19 cases in Croatia is also reflected in the rise of numbers of people who died from Covid-19. That is why in September of 2019 there were 3846 deaths, while in September of 2020 there were 4328 deaths, which means they increased by 12.5% or 482 more deaths. In search of the number 967 that Mr Radman mentions, we analysed the stats for March, May and June 2020 when there were altogether 576 fewer deaths in comparison to the same months last year. However, these numbers are still not close to the number Mr Radman mentioned in the interview. No matter the way in which these numbers are analysed and compared, Mr Radman’s numeric assessment simply does not add up. In addition, during the factchecking process, the team came upon an online article by Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list about Mr Radman’s appearance in the TV news show. However, the journalists made a mistake in their interview transcription. In the article, Jutarnji list states that Mr Radman said there have been 1967 fewer deaths this year, therefore raising the number by a thousand. This was, surprisingly, also done on the website of RTL Direkt, the TV show where Mr Radman made the claim. Afterwards the headline of the article was corrected, but not the header of the video with the interview. Just as it is important to be careful about making true and verifiable claims, it is equally important to accurately report them. To conclude In conclusion, Mr Miroslav Radman’s statement about lower number of deaths in Croatia during the pandemic is false. When making such serious claims and dealing with sensitive information during the pandemic, it is important to be very specific about the data and time frame. This claim is just one of many examples that caused different confrontations and discussions within the scientific community in Croatia and abroad.

As claim source the article mentions a study conducted by the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) – this is false. Moreover, the authors of the actual study do not fully confirm the claim made by unzensuriert. Thus, we rate it as mostly false.  According to  an article published on October 25th, 2020 by unzensuriert.at, an online site with close links to the right-wing populist Freedom Party Austria, the vast majority of Chechen immigrants in Austria do not work. To support their claim the authors quote a study supposingly conducted by the Public Employment Service (AMS) stating that “95 percent of immigrated Chechens live on Austrians”. The statement is supported by a picture of a building with the AMS-logo. Screenshot unzensuriert.at-Website However, the Public Employment Service (AMS) never conducted such a study.  Upon request the AMS pointed out that these numbers have never been collected or published by them. A statistical survey of employment of Chechens immigrants is non-existing due to the fact that employment statistics only capture nationalities. Thus, “Chechens – as a sub-group of Russian nationality – cannot be evaluated“. In its article unzensuriert.at also links to an article published by the Austrian daily newspaper Kurier. Here it is also stated that “five percent of Chechens living in Austria since 2016 do work”. Kurier, however, refers to a report conducted by the research institute Synthesis Forschung. The study was realized on behalf of the Österreichischen Integrationsfonds (ÖIF), a state fund that focuses on integration.  The research report “Erwerbsverläufe von Migrant/innen II“ (employment history of immigrants) analyses the integration progress of immigrants based on data collected by Austrian social insurance agencies and AMS. Upon written request, one of the authors, Günther Kernbeiß, states „I do NOT agree with the claim made by unzensuriert.at”. Kernbeiß elaborates that the report refers to the “population group of Chechens“ only as an “approximate approach“ because there is no such thing as a Chechenian citizenship. In 2016, 416 Chechens immigrated to Austria. Three years later, when the report’s data was gathered, only a third (154 people) had their principal residence in Austria.  Researcher Kernbeiß further explains that “out of these people around five percent are integrated into the labor market”. A person is considered ‘integrated’ when he or she had been working for at least 90 days in 2019.  So, although the study shows a number that correlates with the claim made by unzensuriert.at, the interpretation of the claim is not only misleading, but false. Primarily due to the fact that the population group of Chechens cannot be statistically captured. Upon our request unzensuriert points to the article published by Kurier in which the author confirms that „only 5 percent of Chechens living in Austria since 2016 have a job”. Confronted with our research, the image’s caption was changed and not the AMS but the ÖIF is now cited as the source of their claim.

102;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-russian-news-services-advertise-covid-19-demonstrations-in-germany/;“Russian news services advertise Covid-19 demonstrations in Germany”;2020-11-16;eufactcheck;;Thomas Haldenwang, president of the German intelligence service “Verfassungsschutz”, claimed that “the Internet channel RT Deutsch and the news agency Sputnik advertised so-called Hygienedemos and exaggerated them afterwards“. Our research doesn’t prove Haldenwang right but it’s possible that the Verfassungsschutz uses different sources which is why we assess the claim as uncheckable.   The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz/BfV) is the domestic intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is meant to protect the internal security of the country. The agency’s president, Thomas Haldenwang, released a statement for the presentation of the Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution on July 9th, 2020. Below you can see the translation of Haldenwang’s complete statement regarding Russia’s efforts to influence the public opinion in Germany: “In addition to its espionage interests, Russia strives to influence the political and public opinion in Germany in favour of Russian politics. Russian authorities also try to do this through non-intelligence structures: For example, we recently observed that the Internet channel RT Deutsch and the news agency Sputnik advertised so-called Hygienedemos and exaggerated them afterwards.“ Haldenwangs claim regarding Russian news services in full context. What is a „Hygienedemo“? „Hygienedemo“ is a term for protests relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. “They are a collection of conspiracy ideologists, critics of preventive measures, right-wing extremists and “alternatives”. Many participants attend their first demo and have never been involved in politics before. The corona measures are the first time they feel that political decisions restrict their freedom“, says Miro Dittrich from the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, a non-governmental organization to strengthen democratic civic society.     According to Thomas Kliche, political psychologist at Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences, it is obvious that some of the participants downplay the danger of the virus or even deny its existence. “One group denies it and another sees it as a bioweapon used for ethnic replacement. Contradictions do not play a role here. The virus is compared to the Flu, the media coverage is depicted as a hoax in order to patronize the people and a compulsary vaccination is painted as the devil on the wall.“ Covid-19 demonstration in Paderborn. By students of Jade University Russian news agencies operate in different countries Russian news agencies and networks like Sputnik and RT (formerly Russia Today) operate in several countries like Germany, France, the United States and the United Kingdom. RT owns regional sister channels like “RT America“, “RT France“, “RT UK“ and “RT Deutsch“.  In his statement Haldenwang doesn’t clarify how RT Deutsch and Sputnik have advertised Hygienedemos and where they did it. Although the Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution mentions both RT Deutsch and Sputnik in the paragraph below, there is no concrete evidence given for the claims about the advertisement of Covid-19 demonstrations:  “Russian agencies use propaganda and exert influence with a view to shaping the opinion of and spreading misinformation among a range of target groups. The most important role in this is played by the Internet channel RT Deutsch, the Sputnik news agency, social networks and state or private institutes (“think tanks”). In comparison with previous years, these activities have decreased somewhat in relation to Germany“. A lack of transparency During the press conference for the presentation a Sputnik reporter asks for an explanation from Haldenwang and Horst Seehofer, the Federal Minister of the Interior. The reporter also accuses the Verfassungsschutz of interfering with the freedom of the press and damaging Sputnik’s reputation. In reply, Haldenwang speaks of falsified information by Sputnik (for example exaggerated attendance figures at these demonstrations).      Upon our request, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution replied that it is only obliged and allowed to report to the Federal Government and that it is unable to release information about its methods and the way of working. Unfortunately, that means that we don’t know for sure how the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution came to the conclusion that Russian news services advertise so-called Hygienedemos, exaggerated them and made them seem more dramatic. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution replied to our inquiry: “The BfV as the domestic intelligence service is only obliged and allowed to report to the Federal Government (among others).” Exaggeration and dramatization? Our own research has revealed that RT Deutsch repeatedly reported about Hygienedemos and other anti-government demonstrations regarding the pandemic on their YouTube channel. Sputnik also regularily covers Covid-19 demonstrations for example by broadcasting livestreams of the protests. On April 27th, 2020 RT Deutsch published a report about a so-called Hygienedemo in Berlin titled „Corona-Krise: Politiker gewinnen an Profil, kritische Meinungen werden untersagt“ (English: „Corona-crisis: Politicians gain in profile, critical opinions are prohibited“). The video description says: „What happened on Saturday, how politicians win ground and how critics of the government are intimidated is shown in the report of RT Deutsch editor Maria Janssen“. The video shows scenes from the demonstration, police actions and interviews with attendants. The images are partly underlayed by dramatic music (0.50-1.10, 1.40-2.15). The use of the music could be interpreted as unnecessary dramatization although it’s not unusual for TV channels and other media outlets to use certain music for certain scenes.  In general, most of the videos published by RT Deutsch about Covid-19 demonstrations broadcast scenes from demonstrations in places like Berlin, Munich or Madrid without the use of any effects, dramatization and exaggeration. It is impossible for us to check every single RT Deutsch and Sputnik video, livestream, article and tweet on Hygienedemos and compare the coverage with official numbers or other news sources. Apart from that, articles can be edited afterwards and estimations of attendance figures can vary.    Maria Janssen from RT Deutsch in a screenshot from the video mentioned above. A Sputnik writer has advertised a Hygienedemo We have found no evidence that both RT Deutsch and Sputnik actually advertise Hygienedemos or protests against government policies in general but Sputnik provides a platform for people who promote these demonstrations. Uli Gellermann, a journalist, filmmaker and writer for Sputnik, runs a website where he undoubtably advertises a so-called Hygienedemo in Berlin and appeals to the public to attend the protest. It is important to note that Gellermann’s own views do not necessarely represent the views of Sputnik. Gellermann advertising a so-called Hygienedemo on his own website doesn’t mean that Thomas Haldenwang’s claim that Sputnik and RT Deutsch advertise these demonstrations is true. Uli Gellerman, a writer for Sputnik, advertises a so-called Hygienedemo on his website. Sputnik denies the allegations Sputnik officials deny the allegations of the Verfassungsschutz strenously: “If media coverage alone is classified as advertisement for something and enough to be mentioned in the Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution, then every media that covers it should be mentioned there. There is not a single case in which we have called for participation in these Hygienedemos or reported about them in a way that could be interpreted as encouragement to join them“, says Andreas Peter, managing editor of Sputniknews Deutschland, in a statement published on Sputnik’s website. Peter also addresses Haldenwang’s accusation about the exaggerated attendance figures: “Whenever we reported numbers from a demonstration, we used the numbers given by the police spokesmen who we questioned at those events. We were attacked for our coverage of the first demonstration at the Alexanderplatz because apparently the numbers we reported were too low.“   Conclusion The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution doesn’t reveal how Haldenwang came to the conclusion that “the Internet channel RT Deutsch and the news agency Sputnik have advertised so-called Hygienedemos and exaggerated them afterwards“. Sputnik writer Uli Gellermann represents neither Sputnik nor RT Deutsch, using music in visual reports is standard operating procedure in the media and spreading information about Hygienedemos with exaggerated attendance figures alone can’t be classified as advertisement and dramatization. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution might have additional sources and their research might have led to other results but unfortunately, it is not very transparent in its work and methods.  In short, there is no visible evidence that clearly proves that both Sputnik and RT Deutsch have advertised and exaggerated so-called Hygienedemos. Without the information from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution the claim is uncheckable.

103;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-the-first-doses-of-the-vaccine-will-be-available-in-italy-in-early-december/;“The first doses of the vaccine will be available in Italy in early December”;2020-11-12;eufactcheck;;Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that the anti-Covid drug will begin to be distributed in just over a month: “If the final stages of preparation of the Oxford-Irbm Pomezia-AstraZeneca vaccine will be completed in the coming weeks, the first doses will be available in early December. The statement, taken from the book “Why Italy loved Mussolini (and how he resisted Covid’s dictatorship)” by journalist Bruno Vespa, was made public on 20th October 2020. The Italian Prime Minister’s statement has served to temper the anger of the workers most affected by the pandemic, but it does not fully correspond to reality: in fact, experimental studies on the drug should be completed between the end of November and the first weeks of December, while the actual distribution of the doses will not begin before Christmas or January 2021. This was confirmed by Piero Di Lorenzo, CEO and Chairman of IrbmPomezia, an Italian company working on the development of the vaccine with researchers at Oxford University and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. According to his statement “it is reasonably credible that around 3 million doses will arrive in the country by the end of 2020”. Before that, he specified, “production has been going on for a couple of months. The hope is that the vaccine doses will be available by the end of the year. Let’s keep our fingers crossed”. The gap between the hypothesis suggested by PM Conte and the wish of the scientists is significant. If the last few weeks of experimentation were not to continue as expected, the gap would increase.  The clarifications – relaunched by many British newspapers, including the Daily Mail – by professor Adrian Hill, head of the vaccine research project at Oxford University, also confirm the timing announced by the Italian partners. In addition, the drug has to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (Ema) before it is officially placed on the market and this will only take place at the beginning of 2021, with mass distribution in late spring. Ema’s own website explains that the time required for the analysis and approval of the vaccine is shortening compared to the normal guidelines. The development of a new vaccine usually takes up to ten years: this is the case with the research that is still being carried out on the Ebola virus. The mass mobilisation that has taken place to try to curb the new pandemic is ensuring that everything behind the marketing of a vaccine – from the analysis of preliminary results to the bureaucracy that regulates the approval of a drug under European Regulation 726/2004 – is completed in a maximum of two years. This is shown by the fact that the Ema is committed to analyze the data provided by Oxford about every fortnight in twenty days compared to the usual 40-70 and that it takes decisions on the approval of the different steps in 48 hours instead of 10 days. The same acceleration will also happen for the final OK before the marketing of the vaccine (from 210 days to 150), with the promise to do everything possible to further speed up the bureaucratic procedures. As reported by the World Health Organization, there are three stages in the preparation of a vaccine. In the case of the Oxford drug, the first part of the trial involved 1077 participants: Only one part received the drug, while the other was treated with placebo. Volunteers only knew what had been given to them at the end, so researchers were able to isolate any false positives.  The next two phases involved 10,560 people across the UK, including adults aged between 56 and 69, over 70 and children aged 5-12. The main reason for the drug’s effectiveness is the immune response in the elderly, confirmed by Oxford on 26 October. “If everything goes smoothly we will be able to authorise the first vaccines between January and February”: this is what Guido Rasi, Ema’s Executive Director for nine years, said on the pages of Italian daily La Repubblica on 28 October. It is “extremely difficult if not unlikely” that a vaccine could arrive before Christmas, as announced by PM Giuseppe Conte. Moreover, it is necessary to understand that the first doses will serve to “vaccinate immediately the categories at risk so that by the summer we can have enough vaccinated to see the effects on the pandemic”. The battle against Covid-19 is still long and exhausting because, concludes Ema number 1, to make the whole of Europe immune “you need 500-600 million doses and having them by the end of next year will not be possible”. If someone therefore thought he was in the race for the vaccine, he will not find satisfaction: at least at the beginning the drug will be administered – still partially experimental – giving priority to medical staff, the elderly and people with other serious diseases. To be really sure of keeping the pandemic under control, however, it will take the end of 2021.

The news portal says that since October 19 a curfew starts from midnight to 5 am for a month period, Christmas markets will be canceled, cafes and restaurants will be closed. Russian media writes that due to the situation with the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced a curfew in the country. Also at a press conference following government emergency meeting, was announced that Christmas markets will be canceled, and cafes and restaurants will be closed for a month. In order to check whether the information is true or not, we opened the official website of  Belgian government, then we found the “LATEST NEWS” section on the main page. One of the published news says that the COVID-19 level 4 alert is coming into effect in the country since October 19: indeed the Advisory Committee has decided a number of restrictive measures, including curfew and the closure of Christmas markets. However, the government’s website states that from midnight to 5:00 am, access to public places is prohibited except for important trips that cannot be postponed, such as for medical emergencies, business trips and trips to work.  Also the site says that cafes and restaurants are closed, with the exception for hotels guests who stay in them, and gatherings after funerals for a maximum of 40 people. Thus, we can conclude that the news presented by Russian Internet portal is mostly true, but omits some important details. Curfew has been imposed and restaurants are being closed, but there are some exceptions such as job and emergency travel and funerals.

105;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-theres-basically-a-whole-tier-missing-from-the-uk-welfare-state/;“There’s basically a whole tier missing from the UK welfare state.”;2020-07-21;eufactcheck;;"On March 26th, Jon Stone, a policy correspondent at The Independent UK wrote a series of tweets in which he claimed that select normal EU unemployment benefits are similar to what the UK is doing for those who cannot work due to the COVID-19 crisis. “One thing I think many British people may not understand is that the ‘government will cover 80% of your salary if you can’t work because of the coronavirus’ scheme is actually very similar to how regular unemployment benefit works in a lot of Europe”. Stone went on to claim: “These are funded by contributions, and usually after you exhaust this initial unemployment benefit you fall back to a lower tier that is more akin to Britain’s JSA system. But there’s basically a whole tier missing from the UK welfare state.” Jon Stones statements about the UK unemployment system in the Covid-19 crisis prove to be true.    Unemployment in the UK Jon Stone’hes first tweet, in which he states that the UK government will cover 80% of one’s salary if they are not able to work because of the coronavirus can easily be checked on the UK government website. It states that an employer can claim for their employee’s wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This is to claim to cover wages for employees on temporary leave due to COVID-19. It is stated on the government site that any entity with a UK payroll can apply, including businesses, charities, recruitment agencies and public authorities. If the maintenance of a workplace is affected by COVID-19 then employers are able to put their employees on furlough, a temporary leave, and apply for the grant offered by the government, which covers 80% of their usual monthly wage costs, up to £2,500 a month. This temporary scheme was initially put in place beginning March 1, 2020 and will continue until the end of October. Technically, furlough is not considered unemployment, as it is a temporary position. The UK government website shows that Jon Stone’s tweet is mostly true. However, there is a limited amount of £2,500 per month.   Unemployment in Europe The European Commission website gives information on the unemployment policies in other European countries, which Stone mentions in his series of tweets. According to the European Commission website, under the Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion section, an unemployed person in the Netherlands can be entitled to unemployment benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act. This comes with a number of conditions; insurance against unemployment, having lost at least 5 work hours a week, being available to work on the Dutch labour market, working to find another job, becoming unemployed through no fault of own, and having worked at least 26 weeks in the 36 weeks before you became unemployed. One who meets these conditions in the Netherlands is entitled to 75% of their last pay per day (up to a maximum of €214.28 during the first two months and 70% of the last pay earned thereafter). In Germany, one can apply for unemployment benefits if they have no job, work less than 15 hours per week, are available for work, and are actively seeking to end their unemployment. They must also have been paying contributions for at twelve months of the two years before becoming unemployed, as the contribution rate for unemployed insurance in 2.5% of one’s earned income. To receive unemployment benefits in Germany, one must inform the labour office of their unemployment and apply for the benefit. An unemployed person with children will receive 67% of the net wage they received on average per day during the 12 months before becoming unemployed, whereas someone without children will receive 60%. Although this is less than the 80% of usual monthly wage the UK is covering due to unemployment as a result of the global pandemic, these German benefits are still better than the benefits the UK provides on a normal basis. Based on information provided by the European Commission, France offers a “back-to-work allowance” (allocation d’aide au retour a l’emploi, ARE) paid by unemployment insurance to employees. Similar to the Netherlands and Germany, there are a conditions that one must meet to qualify for these benefits; show proof of termination, be capable of working, be enrolled as a job seeker, have worked at least 88 days, or 610 hours over the past 28 months, or 36 months for those over the age 53 years old, have no reached the legal retirement age, and are willing to accept reasonable job offers. Someone who meets these conditions in France is entitled to nothing less than 57% and not higher than 75% of the daily reference wage. The duration of payment of the allowance to the job seeker depends on the factor of age, as one who is under 53 years old will receive the benefits for 28 months preceding the end of their contract, and one over the age of 53 will receive allowance for 36 months.   Jobseekers Allowance  The UK Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) system works in three different types; ‘new style’ JSA, contribution-based JSA, and income-based JSA. Which type one can get depends on their circumstances. All of these types of JSA come with the conditions that one is available to work, not be in full-time education, and not be working or be working on average less than 16 hours per week. According to the UK government website, under the Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) section, the maximum amounts unemployed people can get is listed, but how much an individual is entitled to depends on factors such as age, income and savings. People from 18-24 years old can receive up to £58.90 per week. Those who are 25 years old or older are eligible for a maximum of £74.35 per week and couples (both over the age of 18) can receive up to £116.80 per week. Payments are usually made every two weeks.   Conclusion Jon Stone’s claim that there is a tier missing from the UK welfare state is true, as the UK does not offer similar unemployment benefits in normal circumstances, aside from what they are offering for furloughed employees during the COVID-19 crisis. Their regular unemployment benefits provide far less than the Netherlands, Germany and France, failing to provide unemployment benefits related to previous salaries.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Serena Halani   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

106;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-croatia-is-one-of-the-most-tolerant-countries-in-the-world/;Croatia is one of the most tolerant countries in the world;2020-07-20;eufactcheck;;According to an article published in the online version of Croatian daily newspaper ‘Večernji list’, titled “List of the most tolerant countries in the world has been published. Where is Croatia?”, the country is very highly ranked. However, the study quoted in the article uses the world “inclusiveness” and does not mention “tolerance” anywhere. Therefore, we decided to check if the translation and the interpretation used in the headline of this article was rightful and accurate.  Inclusiveness index The article in ‘Večernji list’ begins by saying that the results of a study conducted by The Institute of Othering and Belonging are sensational for Croatia. According to the annual 2019 Inclusiveness Index Report among 132 countries of the world, Croatia ranks high at the 13th place. Inclusiveness index helps to identify places and societies that are in the process of improving their inclusiveness towards marginalized groups. Also, the index shows societies that are seeing an increase in social divide.  Specifically, the Institute in the mentioned report describes inclusivity as access to power, both public and private, but also ways of including marginalized members of society. This inclusivity is achieved and rated high when marginalized groups feel valued, when differences are respected, and when basic needs and rights, relative to those dominant groups of society, are recognized. However, the Institute is aware that this approach cannot fully explain qualitative aspects of inclusivity. Therefore each version of the inclusivity index offers backgrounds and stories that go beyond rough statistics.  Given the perceived problem of identifying the notion of inclusion and inclusivity in the media transmission of the results of this research, we wanted to check the validity of journalists understanding that inclusiveness is the same as tolerance. Inclusivity The official Cambridge English Dictionary defines the word inclusivity as “the quality of trying to include many different types of people and treat them all fairly and equally.” In the Croatian language, this word is only mentioned in the context of social inclusion, although the term as such is not yet included in Croatian dictionaries. However, in Vladimir Anić’s Croatian dictionary, the term ‘include’ is defined as giving the right to participate in something. Social inclusion Social inclusion in the Croatian language has been defined solely by the notion of social exclusion in the Croatian Encyclopedia of the Lexicographic Institute Miroslav Krleža. The encyclopedia offers the definition of social exclusion as “incomplete access to civil status rights, which are an important precondition for securing health care, primary education, material standard, etc.”. In this sense, the term social inclusion is defined as ‘a process that provides socially excluded persons with the opportunity to participate in social, economic, cultural and political life and to enjoy standard of living that is considered as satisfying in the society that they live in.” Tolerance versus inclusivity  The notion of tolerance, unlike the notion of social inclusion, found its place in Vladimir Anić’s Croatian dictionary as: “a relationship that fully embraces another, different customs, beliefs and opinions”. The Croatian encyclopedia offers the definition of tolerance as “a general or specific attitude of nor prohibiting, preventing, and obstructing others in their conduct or activities in an area, despite the disapproval of those in power or authority in the area”. The Croatian encyclopedia also emphasizes that tolerance is often interpreted as indifference that “does not imply the validation of permissible or impermissible behavior, and therefore leads to passivity”. Tolerance is, on the contrary, an active relationship, which means that it implies active restraint.  Encyclopedia also describes how tolerance implies inequality in the distribution of power in a society where a certain group of people always possesses more power than the others. In that view, tolerant is an individual who “has the power, in an opinion or action different from his own, by his own free decision to waive the use of force or authority against such an opinion or action”. Therefore, in a society where there have always been marginalized and discriminated groups, tolerance is the first step towards the social inclusion of these same groups in society, ensuring everyone equal access to employment and education. For this reason, inclusivity is connected to the concept of tolerance, but it is certainly false to define these two terms as equal. On the one hand, inclusivity is an attempt to treat different individuals equally with the same right of participation and inclusion in society, while tolerance, on the other hand, is the act of acceptance of the other, regardless of social or cultural differences.  Therefore, we assess that the headline of the article citing Croatia as tolerant country is inconsistent with the purpose of the cited research and therefore false. Croatia is not on the list of the most tolerant countries in the world, but is well placed in the list of countries ranked by the degree of inclusivity, that is, inclusiveness.

In the Dutch talk show ‘Op1’ party leader Rob Jetten from the social-liberal party D66 took part in a discussion and tried to explain how important the proposed Merkel-Macron Corona virus relief agreement is for the EU and the Netherlands. During the interview he stated the following: “Every euro that we give towards the EU budget, 12 euros will be returned to the Dutch business community.” When Jetten made the statement in Op1 (at 25m50s, video in Dutch),  on 19 May 2020, he was arguing for a modern European budget in which jobs and businesses in Southern Europe are preserved. However, the Minister President of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, said in the Dutch House of Representatives on 22 April that the Netherlands needs to get everything in order before they give more money to the EU for help against the corona virus. He said: “With all that money, at some point, they become a party committee looking for a party” (transcript in Dutch).  Jetten then criticized Rutte’s statement in this interview in the national Dutch newspaper ‘NRC Handelsblad’ three weeks later. Jetten continues to clarify himself in a TV interview in the talk show ‘Op1’. He states that we need to look after other EU countries. “We need to realize that our welfare stems from the European market”, he said.  Trade with Spain In addition, Jetten sums up three points about how important a stable EU is for the Netherlands. He starts with: “The Netherlands currently trade more with Spain than with Brazil, Japan and Canada combined.” According to the latest statistics from CBS (see this table from the Central Bureau for Statistics in the Netherlands), this is true. But ‘trade’ has multiple interpretations. What Jetten means, is that the Netherlands exports more to Spain (14,8 billion) then to Brazil, Japan and Canada combined (10,8 billion). When we count the export value in euros of the Netherlands to Spain, Brazil, Japan and Canada and the export value in euros of Spain, Brazil, Japan and Canada to the Netherlands, then it would be around the same amount of ‘trade’. In 2018, Brazil, Japan and Canada combined traded (import value plus export value) just above 24 billion euros with the Netherlands. Spain traded (import value plus export value) 23.5 billion euros with the Netherlands. His statement is mostly true, but it depends on the way you look at the definition of ‘trade’.   import and export values of the Netherlands with Brazil, Canada, Japan and Spain in 2018, Central Bureau for Statistics 2020 Trade with Italy His next statement on his list was: “We make 8 billion euros profit from trading with the Italians.” According to the same statistics from CBS as used before, this is not true. In fact, it is more. For this check we assume that he thinks that profit is the export value minus the import value. The Netherlands imported in 2018 almost 11 billion euros from Italy. Italy imported more than 20 billion euros from the Netherlands. That difference is about 9.6 billion euros instead of 8 billion euros. This actually strengthens his opinion about the EU. For his purpose it doesn’t really matter if the profit is 8 billion or 9,6 billion. His point is that the Netherlands trade a lot with Italy.   import and export values of the Netherlands  with Italy in 2018, Central Bureau for Statistics 2020  Trade with the EU The third and last statement Jetten made is: “Every euro that we give towards the EU budget, 12 euros will be returned to the Dutch business community”. This statement is more complicated.  He used this document from the European Commission as source (page 19, in English). The numbers in the table are a combination of three studies of the estimated benefits of the single market per country. The Netherlands (NL) contributes yearly 6,85 billion euros in the period 2021 until 2027. The estimated benefits for the Netherlands from the European market is 84,02 billion euros. When you divide the 84,02 billion euros by 6,85 billion euros, the outcome is 12,27 euros. That is the 12 euros where Jetten was referring to. The reason why he refers to the Dutch business community, has to do with the GNI in the table. GNI stands for Gross National Income. This is used to calculate the total income earned by a nation’s people and businesses. It also includes money received from abroad. The contribution from the Netherlands to the EU is 0,83% of their GNI, the estimated benefits from the Netherlands is 9,46% of their GNI (almost 12 times as much). That’s why he concluded that the Dutch business community profits. The problem with this claim is that the connection between the contribution from the Netherlands to the EU and the estimated benefits of the single market for the Netherlands is not causal. In definition it doesn’t mean that every euro the Netherlands contribute to the EU, that they get – for that 1 euro – 12 euros in return.  This doesn’t mean that Jetten is wrong about his statement that the Netherlands profit from the single market, but he oversimplifies the reality. The calculations are only about the intrinsic value of the money, it is far harder to – for example – put a value to the knowledge we share in the EU. And if the Netherlands invests less in the EU, it might or might not mean we will get more or less money in return. Also, what will happen if the Netherlands doesn’t assist other European countries financially? We can’t be certain and neither can be Jetten. The exact value of the EU market for a country is a complicated discussion and therefore it can’t be said that this claim is true or false. We conclude that this claim is uncheckable.  Conclusion  The first two statements Jetten made are mostly true: the Netherlands trades more with Spain than Brazil, Canada and Japan combined and also makes a profit on trade with Italy. That the Netherlands business community receives 12 euros per invested euro in the EU budget can’t be concluded. His third statement is uncheckable.

[…] it’s like denying day or night”.;2020-07-10;eufactcheck;;Javier Ortega-Smith, the Secretary-General of the Spanish far-right-wing party, Vox called gender violence a ‘big lie’ after the celebration of the new judicial year in the Community of Madrid, in September 9th of 2019. There was a significant emphasis on gender violence  in that celebration and this made him state that ‘violence is violence and  has no sex’. “Don’t focus on violence against women,” he said. “The statistics do not favour the fight against the violence on women”.    Gender or domestic violence, or both? First of all, it has to be clear that there is a gap between ‘gender violence’ and ‘domestic violence’: “Sometimes, the concept of gender violence is not well defined and is confused with that of domestic violence or plain violence, so that the fight against it may be less effective than intended” (Gimeno Reinoso, B. & Barrientos Silva, V. 2009:1). In the thesis called “Postraumatic Stress Disorder in Women Victims of Domestic Violence: Evaluation of Intervention Programs” made by Paulina Paz Rincón González, says that there have been two big varieties in the study of gender violence: “On the one hand, there is the perspective of family violence, as its name indicates, it focuses on different forms of violence that can occur between the members of a family. On the other hand, there is the feminist perspective, whose object of study is the perpetrated violence against women by the abusive man (Johnson, 1995)” (Rincón González, P. (2003). Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Women Victims of Domestic Violence: Evaluation of Intervention Programs. Madrid: Complutense University of Madrid). Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Law and Society Program at New York University, Sally Engle Merry, makes a difference between violence and gender violence in her book Human Rights and Gender Violence: Translating International Law into Local Justice (2006), Firstly, she says that gender violence is not a new problem. This type of violence exists in all societies all over the world. The thing is that it became a bigger social issue thirteen years ago. Indeed, gender violence was defined as a human rights violation in the 90s. And nowadays, it is considered as the center of women’s human rights. The professor of Anthropology claims that despite its near universality around the globe, local manifestations of gender violence are highly variable. In women’s case, the violence against them in the home is shaped by patterns of marriage and the availability of divorce, by conceptions of male authority and female submission. “Gender violence is embedded in enduring patterns of kinship and marriage, but it can be exacerbated by very contemporary political and economic tensions. In recent years, increasing economic inequalities, warfare, nationalism and insecurity have increased rates of gender violence” (Engle Merry, S. 2006). The Ministry of Health, Social services and Equality of the Spanish government made a paper announcement, in which they describe what gender violence is. It is claimed that gender violence is one of the clearests protests against inequality, subjection and the power of men over women. This kind of violence is based and put it into practice by the subjective difference between both sexes. The Spanish Ministry of Interior is making statistics about gender violence. This statistic indeed claims that gender violence exists by showing the amount of victims it causes in each Spanish autonomous community. According to the ministry of interior, 594.580 is the total number of victims of gender violence in Spain until the 31st of may 2020. The government states that women suffer from violence because they are women. And the victims are women of any social stratum, educational level, culture or economy. Indeed, the Spanish government describes gender violence as that which is exerted on women by the ones who are or have been linked to them by affective relationships (couples or ex-couples). The aggressor’s objective is to cause damage and gain control over the woman, so it occurs continuously over time and systematically in the form, as part of the same strategy. In the article called Violencia de género versus Violencia doméstica: la importancia de la especifidad, Spanish politician Beatriz Gimeno Reinoso and writer Violeta Barrientos Silva claim that the concept of ‘gender violence’ is not well defined and it is often mixed up with domestic violence, or violence itself. Because of this, the fight against gender violence may become less effective. “One thing is to fight against domestic violence and prepare protocols and help resources for the victims of that type of violence (partners of the same sex, under age users, elderly people, susceptible people)… but another thing is to recognise that this kind of violence is different from that which helps as the patriarchy’s tool of control over women, by recognising that the entire society is structured over such organization.” (Gimeno Reinoso, B. & Barrientos Silva, V. 2009:12,13).   Violence affect some more than others Ortega-Smith says that women are not the only ones who suffer from violence. He explains that men, children and elderly people are also victims of violence, so that is why people should not only focus on women. Despite that claim, professor of anthropology Engle Merry explains that women are the most affected ones in terms of gender violence: “Although women are disproportionately the victims of gender violence, in many situations men are also victimized”. (…) “Violence between intimate partners includes women’s attacks on men as well as men’s on women, although women are more likely to be injured” (Engle Merry, S. 2006). Moreover, she says that an analysis that recognizes the effects of the larger social context on gender performances has to be done in order to understand gender violence. When men abuse women in intimate relationships, violence is used by them to define their own gendered identities. Engle Merry explains that a batterer often wants to show the woman that he has the control, or to prove to other men that he controls her. “He may view the violence as discipline that the woman deserves or has provoked. Perhaps she failed to take care of the house or has dressed provocatively and awakened his suspicions and jealousy. Men often use violence to establish power hierarchies, both against other men and through raping other men’s wives. This form of gender violence is a fundamental strategy of war as well” (Engle Merry, S. 2006). According to some statistics made by the World Healthcare Organization (WHO), one out of three women suffers from physical or sexual violence, inflicted by her partner in some moment of her life. Indeed, the WHO affirms that violence against women is a generalized phenomenon and happens in every country. The thing is that the prevalence changes inside of each country. But the studies made in different countries prove that the percentage of women from 15 to 49 years old who have suffered from physical or sexual violence from her partner is placed between 15% and 71%. Until now, the WHO has not talked about violence against men as an issue.                        In the document elaborated by the Consultant of the Women Unity and Development of ECLAC (Economic Comission for Latin America and the Caribbean) Nieves Rico, it is stated that gender violence means the violence that reflects the existent asimmetry in the power relations between men and women. And it also perpetuates the subordination and decaluation of the femenine in the presence of masculinity. “This is characterized by responding to patriarchy as a symbolic system that determines a set of concrete daily practices, which deny the rights of women and reproduce the existing imbalance and inequality between the sexes. The difference between this type of violence and other forms of aggression and coercion is that in this case the risk or vulnerability factor is the mere fact of being a woman.” (Rico, N. 1996:8). In the press release of the statistic of gender violence and domestic violence made by the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) on 19 may 2020, it can be seen that women have been the most affected ones by domestic and gender violence between years 2015 and 2019. As it can be seen in the statistic, there are much more women than men who have suffered from domestic violence. Moreover, the INE does not even mention the number of men who have been victims of gender violence. Indeed, this is the definiton of gender violence stated by the INE: “Gender Violence is understood as any physical or psychological act of violence (including attacks on sexual freedom, threats, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of freedom) carried out against a woman by a man who is or has been her spouse, or who is or has been linked to her by a similar sentimental relationship, even if without cohabitation.” (INE, 2020:2).   Is it getting any better? In the following statistic made by the spanish Gorvernment Office against Gender-based Violence, it can be seen that 71 women were mortal victims of gender violence in 2003, whereas in 2019, there have been 55 mortal victims. In between those years, there have been ups and downs in the results, but in general, the number of mortal victims have decreased throughout the years. Also, the previous statistic says that the number of mortal victims increased between 2018 and 2019. Indeed, in 2018 there were less victims than in 2019 according to the statistic made by the observatory of violence, a project by Fundación Mujeres (Women Foundation). They are a non-government organization and non-profit body that is working since 1994, with the aim of achieving equality between women and men.  In this statistic, they analyze the number of victims caused by gender violence in each autonomous community in Spain, in the fourth trimester of 2018 and 2019. And indeed, there has been an increase of 2,2%.   Conclusion  The three statements made by Javier Ortega-Smith are false. As it can be seen, there are experts and governamental statistics which proof that gender violence exists and is indeed a problem. Women are the ones who suffer the most, and the statistics say that the issue is getting worse again after years of decrease (at least in Spain). As Engle Merry says, gender violence happens all over the world, and there are some patterns in a relationship between two people that define it. Nowadays, it is considered to be an attempt to women’s human rights, according to the World Healthcare Organization. In addition, as experts and statistics have said or proved, there is a gap between domestic and gender violence. And if gender violence would not exist, there would not be statistics to prove how many women die every year because of domestic violence.  So the statement made by Ortega-Smith that “Gender violence is a big lie” is proven false by all the above presented evidence.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Maddalen Bastarrica   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Being confined at home with abusive partners increases the risk to victims. A TV report on Channel One Russia, covering the situation in France, included the claim that using code word “mask-19” is a common practice among French women to let people know that they’re being abused at home. Channel One Russia is known as a pro-Kremlin broadcaster. This reputation is based on the fact that its majority shareholder is the state. Channel One is the second most popular channel in Russia, which reaches numerous national and international audiences. It has a wide network of correspondents around the world, including France. Zhanna Agalakova is an experienced journalist who has been living and working in France for about 15 years. In her report, she talked about a spike in numbers of domestic violence cases and said that French “pharmacies now know the code word “mask 19”. If someone utters it, it means that they want to make it clear that they are in a hellish situation at home, and the aggressor is standing next to them.”  Still from the item on Channel One Russia.  Who said that? In order to check this information, it is needed to find the source that said declaring “masque 19” at pharmacies is a way to let people know about domestic violence. A google search led to the article “French women use code words at pharmacies to escape domestic violence during coronavirus lockdown,” published on ABC news. Scrolling downwards, you can find the following paragraph, pointing at the source of the code word: “Asked about the policy on national broadcaster France 2, Christophe Castaner, the Interior Minister, said that the lockdown put in place since March 17 in France to stem the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in an increase in domestic violence. […] On March 27, the Interior Minister had put a strategy in place with the president of the Pharmacists’ Guild that pharmacists would be a first port-of-call for victims of domestic violence. The code word ‘mask 19’ can be used by the victim if she is accompanied by her spouse, he had suggested.”   What exactly did the source say?    Having found that Christophe Castaner, the Interior Minister of France, suggested using “mask 19” as a code word in his interview for France 2, we proceed with searching the video of the interview. A video fragment of the interview was found on the site of one of the French TV broadcasting aggregators.Indeed, in this interview, Christophe Castaner talked about the possibility of setting up a code that victims of domestic violence can use at pharmacies to let police know about their problems: “I spoke with the president of the National Order of Pharmacists and we agreed on a proposal: to ensure that a woman, perhaps beaten, can come to pharmacy and give the alert there. And then we can intervene immediately to protect her […]Then he added: “It has been practiced in Spain for a few days already, with a code name. You ask the pharmacist to “give me masks 19″ and at that moment it is becoming a warning signal. I’m not going to set that code name and if I said it, it wouldn’t make sense.” So, “mask 19” was used by the Interior Minister of France only as an example, and it cannot be used for identifying women suffering from domestic violence. “It would not make sense” because not only potential victims, but their abusers as well, are now familiar with this code word.       ConclusionTaking all the information found, we would evaluate the claim in Channel One Russia’s report as mostly false. French women were suggested to use a code word at pharmacies to escape domestic violence during lockdown, but not “mask 19”. This word is just an example from Interior Minister of France, Christophe Castaner.       RESEARCH | ARTICLE Polina Kireeva       Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

110;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-if-universities-shift-online-we-risk-more-poorer-students-dropping-out/;“If universities shift online, we risk more poorer students dropping out.”;2020-06-30;eufactcheck;;In a column published by The Guardian, former universities minister Chris Skidmore makes the claim that there’s a higher risk for poorer students dropping out if universities shift online. This article—based on a study from 2017—was posted 4 May, 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis forcing many universities to close and offer fully online courses. This statement was found mostly true. The article opens by describing the current state of universities as a result of the coronavirus shutting them down, which includes a bailout requested from the government for 2.5 billion euros. Skidmore then projects that the immediate future of universities is online—which could be a solution to the universities’ financial strain. But the cost of online learning at the university level falls on students from disadvantaged backgrounds, in Skidmore’s eyes. He cites and quotes the 2017 study done by Eric Bettinger and Susanna Loeb called “Promise and pitfalls of online education.” Skidmore spends a paragraph on the report, saying that poor students perform worse in online courses and are more likely to drop out of such courses. Then he moves on to his personal, anecdotal experiences as the former universities minister and opinion on how universities should move forward.   Sources   In order to verify this claim, it was important to look first at the source cited in the article. Nowhere within the study by Bettinger and Loeb are the words “poor” or “disadvantaged backgrounds” used to describe the students being discussed in the article. Instead, the authors use the term “least well-prepared” where Skidmore used the term “disadvantaged backgrounds.”         The highlighted texts show where (in yellow) Skidmore uses the study to back up his claim about students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The next quote, from from the study, shows where (in blue) the phrase is used to describe the students is “least well-prepared.”   Using the term “least-well prepared” covers a very broad category of students. Of course, this could include students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but since the authors did not specify, we cannot be completely sure this is the group they were referencing. To base the whole article off of this small section of the study and change the label of the students being discussed is a bit of a reach, even though Skidmore does make good points later in the article. It is also important to note that Skidmore’s only source is by academics from the United States. The concept of online learning is universal, but there are still distinct differences in the education systems in the United States and the UK.   Additional evidence   However, just because this study was a bit taken out of context here, does not mean that the overall message isn’t true. To determine if there is a higher risk for students from disadvantaged backgrounds dropping out of online university, more sources must be looked at.   According to a report by Spiros Protopsaltis and Sandy Baum, both underprepared and disadvantaged students underperform and experience poor outcomes on average in online courses. Both Protopsaltis and Baum are professors at universities in the United States. Part of their concern is that with cost-cutting efforts in education, well-intentioned moves to give greater access to university educations could lead to more disadvantaged students experiencing “cheap” and “ineffective” online education.   In another study called “Virtual Classrooms: How Online College Courses Affect Student Success”, which was conducted by professors at Harvard and Stanford, researchers found that students with weak preparation do not do well in online courses. The students in the study attended schools that disproportionately enroll low-income students. These groups of students tend to drop out of college at high rates.        Fact checking in times of corona, Utrecht University of Applied Sciences 2020    The UK Institute for Fiscal Studies did a survey in regard to students’ success with at home learning due to the COVID-19 crisis closing all primary and secondary schools. They found from responses that students from better-off families have greater access to resources for home learning and are spending 30% more time on home learning than students from poorer families. Even though the students surveyed were in primary and secondary school, the survey responses support the idea that disadvantaged students are less likely to thrive in online classes.   There are several factors that could contribute to this overall conclusion that students from disadvantaged backgrounds do not perform well in online class settings. According to The Hechinger Report, maybe most significant is the fact that not all students may own their own laptop or have consistent access to Wi-Fi. Both issues would make it all but impossible to be successful in an online instruction setting. Another contributing factor in The Hechinger Report is that if the students come from low-income backgrounds, they likely work at least one job to pay the bills. This adds in another factor to juggling school and managing online coursework that is largely independent. For these students, most studies found that face-to-face instruction was a much more successful form of instruction.     Conclusion   The claim made by Chris Skidmore that there’s a higher risk for poorer students dropping out if universities shift online is found to be mostly true. This is not to say that all students from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot find success in online classes. However, the leading research makes the conclusion that on average, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to underperform in online courses.       RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Cora Hall       Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

111;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-economist-claims-that-the-vw-scandal-wouldnt-have-happened-if-women-were-in-charge-2/;Economist claims that the VW-scandal wouldn’t have happened if women were in charge;2020-06-25;eufactcheck;;Monika Schnitzer, a German Professor of Economics  at Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, stated in an interview with the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung on May 5th: “My assumption is that the manipulation of the diesel engines and this fraud on the customer wouldn’t have happened if women have had a say in the top-level management.”. She also claims that top-level management should include more women because diverse teams would perform better. Taking that into account, her statement can be rated “mostly true”. Since it’s not possible to go back in time and examine if the VW-scandal wouldn’t have happened if women have had a say in the top management, Schnitzer’s hypothesis can’t be entirely verified or falsified. However, studies on the cause of the VW-scandal, the impact of women on corporate responsibility and fraudulent corporate behaviour as well as on the performance of diverse teams support the economist’s arguments, suggesting that her hypothesis could be correct.  Economist Monika Schnitzer on faz.net  The VW-scandal and its causes The VW-scandal, also known as “diesel gate”, emerged in 2015 when it was revealed that the German car giant has cheated on federal emissions test through the installation of a so-called “defeat device” on at least eleven million of its vehicles. This way the company fooled regulators and hid emissions so that their cars would appear to meet the requirements.Despite the primary cause of the emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which appears to have been misfeasance and malfeasance on a corporate-wide scale, researchers believe that the composition of the board itself facilitated a problematic culture at Volkswagen. A group of researchers identified three major problems with the Volkswagen board from a corporate governance standpoint. Firstly, they mention the interest-conflicting nature argue of the dual-class stock held by the dominant shareholding Porsche and Piech families. Secondly, they bring up the presence of a government as a significant shareholder. And thirdly, the typically German “two-tier” board organization (corporate structure system that consists of two separate boards of directors that govern a corporation) around the principle of co-determination.The authors of the paper conclude that “the failure of oversight at VW can be explained in large part by problems arising from the composition and functioning of the company’s two-tier board”. They believe that the scandal is “a testament to the importance of board composition, theory, and structure in helping to build and maintain a corporate culture that promotes integrity”. According to the aforementioned research, the composition of the board played a major role in the scandal. This suggests that a different composition of the board might have prevented the scandal. To find out how women might have affected the likelihood of the scandal, a look at reports that evaluate the impact of gender composition on corporate social responsibility is needed.   Impact of women in corporate boards   The relationship between gender composition and corporate social responsibility was examined by a study published in the Journal of Business Ethics. The study comes to the same conclusion as several others do: The number of women on the board shows a positive relationship with the strength ratings for corporate social responsibility. Women would bring a number of strengths to the board like increased sensitivity to corporate social responsibility and participative decision-making-styles.Another paper from 2014 provides further evidence that gender-based differences in the governance of firms have important implications regarding corporate performance, the management of risk and the value of the firm. For that reason, the authors recommend that firms should intentionally seek women to serve on their boards.To evaluate women’s impact on fraudulent corporate behaviour, a group of researchers compared 128 firms with violations to a sample of 128 matched control groups. They found that violations are less likely when the board has more women, independent members, and financial experts. Other Studies have also demonstrated that women are more cautious and their business judgments are more ethical. Kaplan, Pany, Samuels, & Zhang found women more likely to report fraudulent financial reporting.     The link between diversity and performance   A BCG study suggests that increasing the diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and improved financial performance. The research concludes that companies with above-average diversity on their leadership teams report a greater payoff from innovation. Companies with above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percent higher compared to companies with below-average leadership diversity.McKinsey states in their report “Diversity Matters” that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. The study “Getting to Equal 2019” by Accenture confirms the importance of diversity. However, it says that while diversity remains a critical building block for innovation a culture of equality is essential to help maximize innovation: “While the impact of diversity factors alone on innovation mindset is significant, it is much higher when combined with a culture of equality. In the most-equal and diverse cultures, innovation mindset is 11 times greater than in the least-equal and diverse cultures. “     Conclusion   Even though Schnitzer’s statement that the VW-scandal wouldn’t have happened with women in the board can’t be rated either true or false for this specific case, studies suggest the positive impact of women on social corporate responsibility and ethic corporate behaviour. Recent research also supports the economist’s claim that diverse teams perform better as diversity corresponds with innovation and improved financial performance. Taking that into consideration, Monika Schnitzer’s claim can be rated “mostly true”.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Sonja Wind   Also read our previous factcheck on Dieselgate     Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

This statement is mostly false, as the number seems to be higher. Monica Anisie`s claim, in an article published by Digi24, after the live interview Context Monica Anisie is currently the Minister of Education, member of the Orban Government, representing the National Liberal Party. This Government was voted by the Parliament on November 4, 2019, and dismissed three months later, by censure motion, but due to the emergency caused by the spread of the coronavirus, it was reinvested. Starting from March 11, 2020, the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research decided to suspend the courses in the pre-university system, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initially established period was of two weeks, but after some deadline extensions, the face-to-face courses were finally suspended for the rest of the semester, and the courses were to be held online. Furthermore, on April 22, the 12th article of the Order of the Minister of Education 4135 / 21.04.2020 made the attendance at these classes mandatory. Similar decisions have been made in most states worldwide, impacting over 60 percent of students, as the UNESCO Institute for Statistics study reveals. The Romanian educational situation during COVID-19 pandemic Even though 80% of Romanian households have internet access, almost half of the population lives in a rural area, and 15% of the citizens live in extreme poverty, according to official reports. Therefore, after switching to online courses, a problem arose: how many pupils can attend the classes and how many of them are actually deprived of education, due to the lack of technology? Monica Anisie`s claim, that 250,000 pupils do not have the infrastructure, is mostly false, because, based on the data available so far, the number is higher. Even though she said that hers is an approximation, the difference is significant. In April 2020, the Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy (IRES) managed to conduct a study entitled School during the state of emergency – students` access to online education in Romania, applied on a national representative sample, with a margin of error of + 2,5%. According to the analysis, one out of three pre-university students did not own, for instance, a webcam and a microphone.  There are approximately 2,8 million pre-university students registered in the 2019-2020 academic year, which would mean that 9% of them did not have access to technology, as specified by Monica Anisie. But according to the survey conducted by IRES, the number is three times higher, which means 840,000 students are in this situation (30% of the total). These students do not have access to a functional device (smartphone, PC, laptop, etc.)   Pupils` access to devices for online courses, according to IRES survey Moreover, 10% of pupils living in urban areas and 19% of pupils living in rural areas claim that the Internet connection in their home is not strong enough to support the online courses. Even though it is not applied on a representative sample, a survey conducted by UNICEF shows similar results: 71% of the respondents think that students’ access to devices for connecting to digital education is deficient and for 60% of them the Internet access is limited.  Both studies were already published when Monica Anisie made the statement. Moreover, in the same interview, the minister said that “tomorrow (May 5), at 9 AM, we will have a video conference and we will present these figures publicly”. According to the Ministry’s website, these numbers have not been released. At the same time, Anisie said  that she will ask the County School Inspectorates for solutions until June 12, 2020, which have not been released, nor mentioned, at the  moment this article was published.  Conclusion Taking into account all the data, the statement made by the Romanian Minister of Education and Research, Monica Anisie, that approximately 250,000 students do not have access to technology, is mostly false. She did not provide concrete data, but only an estimated number, which is the reason her claim cannot be considered entirely false. At the same time, according to the IRES representative survey, the number is significantly higher than what she initially stated.

Wrote by Marja Novak, The claim turns out to be true. The Slovenian government late on Thursday called an official end to its coronavirus epidemic, becoming the first European country to do so, after authorities confirmed less than seven new coronavirus cases each day for the past two weeks. To examine the statement we refer to the official central website of the state Slovenian administration GOV.SI, which mentioned:“The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Slovenia is currently slowing down, so the Government on 15 May announced an end to the epidemic, which it declared on 12 March, based on an expert assessment by the National Institute of Public Health and provided for by the Communicable Diseases Act”. Reuters statement has been also reported that:  “Slovenia has tamed the epidemic over the past two months… Today Slovenia has the best epidemiologic picture in Europe,” Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament earlier on Thursday. Government said foreign citizens who show signs of coronavirus infection will still not be allowed to enter the country. A quarantine of at least 14 days will remain in place for people from non-EU states, except for some exemptions including diplomats and people transporting cargo. Citizens will still have to follow basic rules to prevent a possible spread of infection, the government said without elaborating. The information provided by Reuters was announced by the Slovenian government in an official statement on May 15th 2020. In addition, on May 14th 2020, the official Slovenian website has published Prime Minister’s Speech At Extraordinary Session of the National Assembly which he mentioned during it what Reuters editor Marja Novak, says in the statment “Today Slovenia has the best epidemiological picture in Europe”, according to solvanian prime minster. To sum up, after examining statement -Slovenia calls an end to its coronavirus epidemic, relaxes some border controls- the topic is true.

114;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-chance-to-get-infected-with-coronavirus-outside-smaller-than-inside/;The chance to get infected with coronavirus is smaller outside than inside;2020-06-14;eufactcheck;;The coronavirus has been infecting people worldwide for over half a year now. We know more and more about the disease that causes Covid-19. It plays a substantial role in our lives nowadays and many statements are made about the virus. Thierry Baudet, leader of the Dutch political party Forum for Democracy (FVD) said, at a Dutch program that the chance to get infected in an outdoor environment is very small. His statement is mostly true.  The leader of FVD made his statement in the Dutch television show ‘Goedemorgen Nederland’ on June first. He did not mention a source to substantiate his statement and his statement also lacked an exact number. On the same day he visited the Dutch city Volendam for the re-opening of restaurants and cafés and made the same statement on RTL Boulevard. FVD politicians visited this city to protest against social distancing in The Netherlands, the 1.5 meter rule. A survey from Hongkong, dated 7 April, showed that only one in 7324 infections has occurred in an outdoor environment. This survey was led by Li Yuguo from the University of Hongkong. A 27 year old man, who was having a talk with somebody who returned from hotspot Wuhan was infected with the coronavirus. Director of the Dutch Centre of Infection control from the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM), Jaap van Dissel, said to the Dutch newspaper ‘The Volkskrant’ that the risk outside is indeed smaller than inside, because it gets blown away and because of the UV-light of the sun. In his technical briefing, on 4 June, he partly returned from this statement. He claimed that there has not been sufficient research on the infection risk in an outdoor environmental versus an the indoor environmental. According to Van Dissel the survey from Hongkong has been done in a period when people in China had to stay inside. ‘’Besides, this survey was done is a period where people would not leave their homes due to the weather conditions. And even when someone stepped outside, there was nobody else in the streets, because everybody had to stay inside’’, according to Jaap van Dissel. Nevertheless he added that there are very good reasons to assume that the risk is more critical in an indoor environment than in an outdoor environment, but the virus could still be transferred outdoors. A good reason to maintain the one and a half meter rule, he argued. Ventilation  Japanese researchers came to a similar conclusion with a similar research on 16 April. They consider it plausible that the transferring of the virus in an indoor environment is 18,7 times higher than in an outdoor environment. They researched 110 cases. The renown Dutch pollster Maurice de Hond mentioned this number on television in the Dutch news programme ‘EenVandaag’. Virologist Ab Osterhaus said to EenVandaag that this is not a holy number. Despite that he acknowledged that the chance to get infected is way larger in an closed room, than outside. He explained that there is more ventilation outdoors and people can keep more distance. The first factor is harder to arrange indoors. Also engineer Atze Boerstra from ‘BBA Binnenmilieu’ (BBA indoor environmental) told EenVandaag that the chance to get infected indoors is larger than outdoors, because the gathering of people indoor is more likely and frequent than outdoor. And a lot of indoor-environments are badly ventilated. On 30 May some virologists made a call in the Dutch newspaper ‘Algemeen Dagblad (AD)’. They advised a less strict maintenance of the one and a half metre rule outside. Louis Kroes form the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) says that the transferring of the virus happens way less often outside than inside. Although she emphasized that there is a chance that the virus will spread outside, she states that this will not result in a fast spread of the pandemic. Virologist Coretta van Leer of the University Medical Centre Groningen underscored again the importance of ventilation.   Conclusion The statement that the chance to get infected in an outdoor environment is smaller than inside, is mostly true. Because of the lack of exact figures, in this stage of the pandemic, we cannot determine with certainty that this is completely true for the spread of coronavirus. Experts agree that most infections have occurred indoors. They furthermore agree that due to ventilation and more options to keep 1.5 meter distance, chances are smaller to get infected with coronavirus in an outdoor environment.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Sebas Lammers Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

It is reported that EC is going to provide EUR 3.200.000 within the framework of the grant for the promotion and protection the freedom of expression in Russia and the development of media literacy. The news about allocation of funds within the framework of the grant contains information that the initiative to increase the level of media literacy in Russia is of particular relevance in a context of pandemic. The youth is a target audience. The information published on the RT website does not contain links to the official text of the EC’s grant. In order to check the data I found the official website of the European Commission . Then I made a search “media literacy Russia” in the search string. The first search result was “New Call for Proposal for Russia in the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)” , this text is a brief description of the grant. The text was published on April 10, 2020. There is a confirmation of the intention to provide funding to the initiative with the overall budget of EUR 3.200.000in the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). The details on the importance of the initiative during the pandemic and recommendations to carry out activities in Russian regions outside Moscow and St. Petersburg are contained in the documents.

116;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-were-living-through-the-biggest-carbon-crash-ever-recorded-2/;“We’re living through the biggest carbon crash ever recorded.”;2020-06-12;eufactcheck;;On the 6th of May 2020, the BBC published a story with the headline “Climate change and coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash”.  The article goes on to state that “We’re living through the biggest carbon crash ever recorded.” This claim is uncheckable.  The checkability of the claim is connected to multiple unknowns such as relative or absolute terms, annual or total records as well as anthropogenic or total emissions, all of which are discussed below. Because it is such a complicated matter, and it deals with predictions it is uncheckable.Two weeks after the BBC claim, on the 19th of May, a study was published by British journal Nature Climate Change, which indicated a calculated mean of 17% drop in CO2 emissions per day. Media, such as the Guardian and Forbes have reported on this study saying: record cuts in global CO2 emissions due to lockdowns. This new study revealed new information relevant to the factcheck.   Reliable SourcesThe BBC article uses two primary sources to support this claim: The Global Energy Review 2020 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and an analysis by Carbonbrief. Both are considered reliable sources. The article also suggests that “multiple sources indicate” that the claim is true.  The analysis by Carbonbrief is mainly a prediction, writing “Coronavirus set to cause largest ever annual fall in CO2 emissions”. Not stating that we are currently experiencing this phenomenon, but merely stating that it is a possibility if trends continue in the same manner throughout the year. The article was mostly based on The Global Energy review 2020 by the IEA, where their calculated projections for annual energy-related CO2 emissions for 2020 were an 8% drop relative 2019. This projection assumes that lockdowns are progressively eased.During the 100 days of data for 2020 available at the time of the study, they calculated a 3.8% drop in energy-demand, which translates into an estimated 5% drop in energy-related CO2 emissions relative the first quarter of 2019. This equals an estimated 500 million metric tons CO2(MtCO2). There is no reason to doubt that the estimations made based on the drop in energy-demand are correct. It is important to note that declines are not only due to Covid-19, but also due to a milder than usual winter and transitions to green sustainable energy sources.The IEA wrote in their report that we have experienced “a major drop in CO2 emissions, surpassing any previous declines”. This could have been misinterpreted to refer to the estimated 5% drop in emissions, but it actually refers to the projections. “This sentence should refer to the projected annual reduction of 8%. Unfortunately, we don’t have the quarterly data to be able to substantiate if the quarterly decline in 2020 is unprecedented” says the IEA in an e-mail.  The “biggest carbon crash ever recorded”  “During the depression global CO2 emissions dropped from 1145 billion metric ton carbon (GtonC) in 1929 to 847 GtonC in 1932. That is a 26% drop, which is 5 times more than the biggest carbon crash ever recorded. Note that I use tons of carbon, not tons of CO2, which would be 44/12 = 3.67 times larger.” says Pieter Tans, senior scientist at NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, referring to the estimated 5% drop in energy-related CO2 emissions.It is important to note that while carbon is an element, CO2 is a compound made up of carbon and oxygen. In the BBC article they first talk about carbon, but go on to discuss CO2 emissions, so I can assume that they were referring to a drop in CO2 emissions.The greatest annual decrease in CO2 emissions was in the years 1944-1945, when emissions fell by 845 MtCO2, according to Carbonbrief.One thing is certain, the IEA’s estimated 5% is not greater the largest declines in CO2 emissions ever recorded. However, their projections, if they come to fruition, might be. The projected 8% decline equals 2600 MtCO2. “Any comparisons with historical declines are comparing annual declines, rather than quarterly declines. In absolute terms the annual decline projected for 2020 would be the largest since records began during the industrial revolution. In relative terms the annual decline is the biggest since WWII.” says the IEA.The problem here though is that the BBC article writes “biggest carbon crash ever recorded” and not “biggest annual carbon crash ever recorded”. But since the source used in the article is concerned with annual declines, it is safe to assume that the BBC article was also referring to an annual decline, but we cannot know this for sure. New study changes everything Now, over a month after the BBC article was posted, a new study has been published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change where an estimation of a 17% decline in CO2 per day. “The total change in emissions until the end of April is estimated to amount to –1,048 (–543 to –1,638) MtCO2, equivalent to a –8.6% decrease over January–April 2019” said the study. This study is made over 4 months and is based on daily data of activity for six economic sectors. That is because CO2 emissions are reported as annual values, often released months or years after the end of that year.  That being said, they expect the annual decline to lie between 4.2% and 7.5%. What does it mean?  The UN Environment programme published a story which said that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are causing CO2 concentrations to accelerate. It is important to note that CO2 emissions and CO2 concentrations are different, and that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will only decline once we reach net-zero. “CO2 concentration is increasing. This level is the historical record (in the last 800,000 years), although, May 2020 is expected to be even higher. And if we look at the trend in the past few years or decades, the increase is accelerating.” said Pascal Peduzzi Director of UNEP/GRID-Geneva and Programme, Manager of the World Environment Situation Room.CO2 emissions, despite the estimated 17% reductions, are still at 83%. The NOAA states on their website that any “missing” CO2 emissions due to covid-19 do not stand out yet, and that the drop in emissions needs to be large enough to stand out from natural CO2 variability caused by how plants and soils respond to seasonal and annual variations of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.In short, the “missing” CO2 emissions are so small they cannot be detected, and due to our remaining CO2 emissions, CO2 concentrations continue to rise. Peduzzi also stresses that we are going about this change in the completely wrong way. The article is in this sense misleading, as it makes it seem like the drop in CO2 emissions that we have seen due to the lockdowns have an impact.It is also relevant to take into consideration anthropogenic (caused by humans) and other sources of CO2 emissions. In order to understand why this is important, we can put it next to the impact that the Australian forest fires had. According to a publication by the Australian Government they estimate that the fires released 830 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2-e).   Conclusion In conclusion, the claim “We’re living through the biggest carbon crash ever recorded” is uncheckable. In absolute terms (the total amount of CO2 emissions) it is a probable annual prediction, but in relative terms(percentage) it may not be. This is to say if it is indeed an annual comparison to previous records. In that case, the new study by the British journal Nature Climate Change and it’s estimated mean of a drop of 1048 MtCO2 would be higher than the previous annual record, not taking the Australian forest fires into account. It also depends on if the CO2 emissions accounted for are the global total emissions or only anthropogenic emissions. During the recession 2008-2009 they saw a decline in CO2 emissions followed by a sharp rise in CO2 emissions the following year. CO2 emissions may very well rise again in the same manner this year, unless the correct structural efforts toward sustainability are made. Since measures to measure CO2 emissions in real-time are not readily available, and we are comparing to annual values, we will not know before the annual values for 2020 are published. So, it is uncheckable for the following reasons: we don’t know if it is an annual or total comparison, if it is referring to anthropogenic or total CO2 emissions or if it is made in absolute or relative terms. The predictions are valid, but CO2 emissions for 2020 haven’t been reported on yet. The claim is hyperbole, making it sound like a grand phenomenon that anthropogenic CO2 emissions have dropped, when in fact we would need emissions to reach net-zero before it has a significant impact on CO2 concentrations. Although, it is a step in the right direction if it leads to sustainable measures being put into place.         RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Dominique Pashley     Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Little has changed since then in the Scandinavian countries.  Who said what?The article claims that the law in Scandinavian countries leaves victims of sexual violence out in the cold. To check this, we need to understand what that means. Amnesty indicates that Scandinavian countries have signed the Istanbul Convention. The Convention covers rape and all other sexual acts without mutual consent, as crimes. Which means that a victim has to refuse verbally or non-verbally and only then it would be considered sexual violence. According to Amnesty, many victims experience the so-called ‘freezing’: they paralyze. Experts indicate that this is a common reaction. As a result, victims who are paralyzed, and are therefore unable to contradict, would not experience sexual violence under the law. CheckTo check the claim, we need to look at what laws Scandinavian countries have regarding sexual violence. In Sweden, a law was passed in July 2018 stating that sex is prohibited without explicit consent. With that, the government hopes to combat rape and sexual abuse. Finland, on the other hand, is still behind when it comes to this and was called upon by the Council of Europe in September 2019 to reform its rape legislation in order to criminalize a lack of consent rather than just the use of force. Denmark and Norway also follow the Istanbul Convention in their countries when it comes to sexual violence and rape. They still don’t define sex without consent, like Finland, as rape. Rape survivorsWe have examined the research from Amnesty International, Time for change: Justice for rape survivors in the Nordic countries (2019). They have thoroughly investigated the circumstances surrounding sexual violence. All Scandinavian countries have been viewed separately, in terms of laws, handling of police investigations and access to aid.They interviewed 45 women from different countries about this. In addition, there are several news articles, including from the Dutch newspaper AD and The Guardian, about the lack of legislation in Scandinavian countries when it comes to this topic. On the website of the ‘European Institute for Gender Equality’ you can find out what laws in different countries look like and how they act. In Finland, for example, rape is seen as ‘a person who forces another to have sexual intercourse through use or threat of violence’. ConclusionWe rate Amnesty International’s article as mostly true. The investigation covers the whole of Scandinavia, and so does the ruling. But Sweden has a different policy than the other Scandinavian countries and is already very much ahead, even compared to other European countries. Most of the claim, however, is true. Denmark, Finland and Norway continue to follow the Istanbul Convention, which leaves victims of sexual violence and rape short when it comes to conviction. The figures on police investigations and judgments of penalties also speak for themselves; the legislation ensures that fewer rapists/perpetrators are caught and punished. As a result, the claim: ‘There is outdated legislation in Scandinavia when it comes to rape ‘ is mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

He added that arrivals were only 1500 in the same period last year”.   It is well known that Malta has had a secret agreement with Libya for three years, based on which the Maltese armed forces track barges, travelling to the island, and asking Libyan coastguards to bring migrants back to North African detention centers. On the 4th of June, Italian newspaper Avvenire published a memorandum of understanding between the two countries that formalizes what has been happening. A second report by Avvenire and the British newspaper The Guardian  showed that a Maltese patrol boat hijacked to Sicily a dinghy, carrying 101 people. The dinghy  was already in Maltese territorial waters. Therefore, Matteo Salvini is telling the truth about Malta. According to reports from Reuters , since the 3rd of March 2020, Greece had already rebuffed about 35.000 migrants coming from both sea and land. Salvini’s claim about Greece is correct but it is difficult to prove the link between those events and the number of migrants who reached Italy. As a matter of fact, Greece received 9.935 immigrants from January 2020 to May 2020, and only 3.843  from the 20th of February, date of first declared infection by Covid-19 in Italy. About Greece we could also remember that last November, the Hellenic parliament voted in favor of a controversial bill, introducing sweeping changes to the national asylum system, including cutting some options for appeal and facilitating the deportation of failed asylum seekers.   When Matteo Salvini quotes the number of landings in Italy, he is accurate. As a matter of fact, according to Unhcr, from January 2020 to May 2020, 5119 people arrived by sea and in the same period last year they were 1561. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to clarify some points.  Salvini underlines that those 5119 landings occurred this year “despite the virus”. But we can notice that, from the 20th of February – when first Italian case of Covid-19 was declared – to the 31st of May, landings are 3054 in total. On the other hand, League’s leader uses the word sans-papiers referring to immigrants. It is incorrect because although they enter the country irregularly, they could not be called sans-papiers from the moment they submit the asylum application. Considering their countries of origin, a huge number of people arrived to Italy can be qualified as “asylum seeker”. Conclusion: Salvini’s claim is mostly true, although it is generic and incorrect in the way it connects facts, numbers and words.;https://www.la7.it/nonelarena/video/redistribuzione-immigrati-matteo-salvini-leuropa-ha-parlato-tanto-ma-ha-fatto-zero-31-05-2020-327927,https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/accordo-malta-libia-respingimento-migranti,https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/cosi-malta-respinge-i-migranti-e-li-dirotta-verso-libia-e-italia,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/we-give-you-30-minutes-malta-turns-migrant-boat-away-with-directions-to-italy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-greece/greece-blocks-35000-migrants-plans-to-deport-arrivals-after-march-1-idUSKBN20S0RJ,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5179,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205,https://www.instagram.com/;“While Greece and Malta are rejecting migrants, in 2020 in Italy more than 5000 sans-papiers arrived, despite the pandemic”;;;;;;

This claim was published in many Belgian media as ‘Het Laatste Nieuws’, ‘Knack’ and ‘Dewereldmorgen’. The claim turns out to be uncheckable. Both NMBS and ÖBB were unable to explain where the number 10 comes from. ÖBB referred to their own web page which did include the number 10, but no source to any research files. NMBS, on the other hand, referred to the online calculation module Eco Passenger but contradicted themselves twice. They mentioned a factor 10 as well a factor 14 but couldn’t explain why. Reliable calculator, inaccurate numbers Most of our experts referred to Eco Passenger. This tool calculates how much CO2 emissions would be released over the same distance using a plane, car or train. You can change the variables such as ‘with climate factor’, or ‘occupancy rate’. This leads to very varied results. Monique Sys, institute director of the Institute for Environment & Sustainable Development (University of Antwerp), confirms the reliability of the calculator. But she concludes that trains are 5 times more ecofriendly than airplanes, not 10. Others, such as WWF, claim that trains are only 5 times more environmentally friendly than airplanes at a distance of 500 km. And even less, 2,8, on a distance over 1000 km. The Belgian politician Kim Buyst from the Flemish green party Groen confirms that the results vary a lot and go from 5 to 20 times more environmentally friendly. She claimed that there would never be an unambiguous number because the CO2 emissions depend on too many factors. Results with Eco Passenger 5 is also one of the numbers that we came upon using Eco Passenger. But we also got outcomes between numbers 4 and 20, depending on the variables we used. You can test Eco Passenger yourself, using this link: http://ecopassenger.org/bin/query.exe/en?L=vs_uic  Different trains have different CO2 emissions  Depending on what train is used for a journey, a different amount of CO2 emissions is released. In our case, the night train from Brussels to Vienna, electricity is used for the most part of the journey, which definitely makes it more environmentally friendly than trains driven by diesel. But besides the fuel, also the occupancy rate and the discarded distance can influence the result.  Conclusion We argue that this claim is uncheckable. There are simply too many factors on which the number varies.

In one article posted on the Dutch right-wing news site De dagelijkse standaard claims that EU politicians are finally acknowledging that China is taking over European companies on a large scale during and before the outbreak of COVID-19 on the continent. Which makes you wonder, is it true that Chinese investors are acquisitioning large amounts of European companies? Claim: China has been taking over large amounts of European companies in the past years. Some of the biggest economies in Europe such as Germany, England and France have been fending off Chinese acquisitions over their companies in the past. In recent past years, articles have shown that some of Europe’s leading economies have been tightening their regulation over foreign direct investments (FDI). In an article by Growth Business, it stated that Chinese acquisitions of UK companies have tripled since 2014. This was the result of the UK going through a rough time due to Brexit. According to an article written by Statista, West Europe has been very cautious with Chinese acquisitions especially after China took over Germany’s industrial robotics company Kuka in 2016. This also led the UK to introduce new regulations that would “[enhance] government powers to prevent foreign acquisitions and it was largely focused on Beijing’s transactions.”  However, since the shopping spree that China went on in 2016, which led the EU members to impose harsher restrictions on FDI, the number of takeovers by china has declined by a significant amount.  Before Margrethe Vestager made the statement, several other officials brought this situation to the public’s attention. Germany’s Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier stated that Germany will protect its companies that have been weakened by the pandemic, “I say to all those people in hedge funds and elsewhere who are looking forward to acquiring one or the other [German firms] on the cheap — make no mistake, we are determined to stand by our companies.” “Berlin will also set up a €500bn bailout fund that will take stakes in stricken companies, in what amounts to a radical intervention by the state in the workings of the market economy.” In a Forbes article, it stated that NATO also warned EU members of  “Chinese companies swooping in with buckets of cash to buy strategic stakes, or majority control in US and European companies as asset prices fall due to the pandemic.” Conclusion As the statistics show that Chinese foreign direct investment has only been in decline since 2016 and there is no concrete proof of Chinese companies taking over EU companies more than before the pandemic outbreak, the claim of China taking over large amounts of European companies in the past years is false.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Maria Cazacu    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

CLAIMThis statement by Henk Krol, ex-party leader of the Dutch party 50PLUS: “How is it possible that Austria distributes masks at supermarkets and in public transport, and the Netherlands do not even have enough for their health care staff?” needs two checks. First, we check to see if it is true that Austria is distributing masks to their citizens in supermarkets and in public transport and secondly we check to see how this compares to the mask shortages in The Netherlands. Distribution in AustriaDid the Austrian government distribute masks at supermarkets? Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz stated in a press conference on 30th March that from April first, there is a mask available for everyone in Austria. He added: “But in some branches, it may take a day or two longer.” The second-biggest paper in Austria, Heute, wrote on the 4th of April that a few big supermarkets already started distributing free masks. A video from Heute shows two staff members in front of a table with a sign that states: “Protective masks must be worn. The government requires that masks must be worn. Protective masks are very popular in the world market and are difficult to obtain. We ask you to also distance yourself in the interest of other customers.” Also, the official website of the Austrian government states that starting form 14 April covering your nose and mouth will also be obligatory in public transport. If there are no masks available, scarves or shawls can may be used. The most important protection, according to the Austrian government, is the one-meter distance people need to keep from each other. So, it looks at first as if Krol’s statement is true.  At the time of the debate (16th of April), masks were indeed being distributed by the Austrian government. However, there is a catch.    Comparing different masksThe catch is hidden in the type of masks. The medical staff in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch government, use  FFP2 masks (Filtering Facepiece Particle, a mask that filters particles) and surgical IIR masks (see this PDF, in Dutch). The masks that are being distributed by the Austrian government are masks that do not meet  the criteria needed by  medical staff to protect themselves. For example, the Austrian masks are made without a proper filter and vary in fit: they don’t fit tightly over the nose and mouth with every person. Professor of Medical Microbiology at the UMCG, Bert Niesters, explains in Dutch newspaper Dagblad van het Noorden: “Coronaviruses and other viruses can be found in small droplets and you get infected from a short distance. You can only get real protection from a mask with filters.” Also, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) states on the English part of their website that the non-medical masks do not protect against the virus. “Because a non-medical mask protects only to a limited extent, this cannot substitute the 1,5 meter distance you need to keep, the hygiene measures and the (home)isolation of people with health problems.” In short, the masks Krol refers to  are not the same, he is comparing apples and oranges. CONCLUSIONTherefore, ex-party leader of 50PLUS Henk Krol’s statement is mostly false: sure, he is right about the distribution of free masks to citizens in Austria but he is comparing those (inferior) masks to masks used by medical professionals in The Netherlands. This false context does not provide fertile grounds for a discussion on the shortage of masks in Dutch healthcare.  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

They (non-medical face masks) are more infection-nurturing than virus-repellent if they are consistently put in handbags and reworn, as it often happens.” So, our fact check began and turned out to be uncheckable. Step one: Send out inquiries until your fingers hurt Firstly, Claudia Wild, CEO of the Austrian Institute for Health Technology Assessment (AIHTA), told us that she was indeed talking about non-medical face masks that cover mouth and nose as well as self-sewn face masks. She also stated that she was referring to two studies in her statement: one of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (“COVID 19 – Masks on or off?”) as well as a cross-country research (“Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses”). Claudia Wild also mentioned that her claim was not about the general rejection of non-medical face masks, but about their handling. But her sources supporting her claim? While researchers on “COVID 19 – Masks on or off?” summarize that the evidence of 14 trials showed no effects on the use of masks versus no masks, they admit that this is not a final finding. They also state the risk of masks getting filthy and contaminated with airborne pathogens. The second study could not find enough evidence to support the use of facial barriers without combination with other measures. Nevertheless, they would still recommend using masks. These two studies do not fully falsify or verify Claudia Wild’s claim. Even though they are critical about the performance of masks, they don’t include statements on their safety when packed and repacked. Therefore, we also took sources of the Austrian Department of Health into consideration, which is shaping the discourse around important healthcare decisions like the Covid-19 epidemic. Step two: Try to understand the scientific jumble The Austrian Department of Health pointed us to two additional studies: an ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) report (“Using face masks in the community”) as well as a report of the renowned German Robert-Koch-institute. Arguments brought forth by the ECDC report include pros and cons. For example: Through wearing non-medical face masks one is likely to touch his/her face less and therefore minimize the infection risk. However, it also states the following: “There is a risk that improper removal of the face mask, handling of a contaminated face mask or an increased tendency to touch the face while wearing a face mask by healthy persons might actually increase the risk of transmission.” In line with the other reports, this one also states that there is only limited and indirect evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical face masks. Moreover, people could mistakenly have a false feeling of security. Findings of the Robert-Koch-institute paint a similar picture: On one hand they emphasize the need of not touching the masks to avoid contamination as well as a higher risk of contamination the longer a mask is worn. On the other hand, they also refer to a new study which shows that non-medical masks help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Step three: combine all your ingredients Even though all sources did not specifically falsify or verify Claudia Wild’s claim, all of them are ambivalent towards the effect of non-medical face masks. Furthermore, the ECDC report explicitly states that masks should be handled very carefully. However, none of the studies or reports declare that the masks truly get more infection-nurturing than virus-repellent. Summing up, this claim is uncheckable. It does raise the question on the efficiency of making masks mandatory in public spaces as well as if the Austrian government’s credo is “better safe than sorry”.

123;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-matteo-salvini-recovery-fund-is-a-loan-like-the-esm/;Matteo Salvini;2020-05-28;eufactcheck;;"On the 20th of May, Matteo Salvini, leader of the Italian Far Right party “The league”, rejected the proposal for a post-Covid EU grant-based recovery plan, outlined by the French President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and unveiled in a surprising press conference on the 18th of May. A statement issued on air in the show  “Radio Anch’io” Radio and reposted on Twitter said in full:  #Salvini: #RecoveryFund is a LOAN. Like the #Esm. #Radioanchio A resounding rejection, yet announced the night before, when Salvini ­– speaking on the TV talk show “Stasera Italia” on Rete 4 – had declared:  We have been told for weeks: “How can you say no to ESM? It is interest-free, it has no conditions”. Then one goes to check, these weeks, Greece said no, France said no, Spain said no, Portugal said no. Either they are all fools if it is a gift, or, evidently, it is not a gift. Neither the ESM, nor this fund which is a loan. I do not condemn the idea, but it is not money given away, it is money lent. At this moment there is no lira, or euro that is a freebie: they are loans. One can say whether the loan is convenient for them or not. In my opinion, Italians are looking for another type of loan. Today the treasury bonds destined for Italian savers were snapped up: five billion today, three billion yesterday, and as many tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. So, in my opinion, the Italians have understood that these years’ Europe is little to be trusted. Matteo Salvini’s statement is mostly false, as it simplifies a more complex perspective. The Recovery Fund project provides for the allocation of resources to be partially drawn from the European Community budget. Italy is the third-largest contributor, after France and Germany, with a rate of 14% of the overall budget of the European Union, thus paying more than it receives. The appropriations foreseen by the Recovery Fund would be established based on the economic losses due to the pandemic, and not based on the share of national wealth – as for the regular contribution – and paid to the Member States through net transfers (directly, as in the case of the structural funds). Such a weighting would allow the hardest-hit states to receive more than they contribute to, without burdening the public debt. In concrete terms, for Italy the net balance would be positive. According to current estimates, it would receive € 55 billion, the result of the difference between the € 125 billion envisaged by the plan for the first year and the € 70 billion in regular contributions. On the other hand, the funding provided by the Recovery Fund, should come from: The issue of common debt securities on the financial markets. The interest rates would be between 0.1% and 0.5%. An AAA-rated supranational entity would issue the bonds. In addition to the States, the ECB would probably buy the debt securities, and the expiration of the aid would last for ten years;The introduction of European taxation, with which the European institutions could, therefore, collect taxes directly within their borders (such as a digital tax or a carbon tax). Only if the European taxation project weren’t finalized, the EU states would be asked to repay the financing through an extraordinary contribution, whose size is yet to be defined. As for conditionalities, the Franco-German document explains that the recovery plan would be supported by commitments from EU governments to undertake “sound economic policies” and healthy structural reforms. The plan would become operational from 1st January 2021 as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni has urged EU leaders toward an agreement, and everything should be ready by mid-September 2020, but more will depend on which plan will be chosen and when it will be approved: on 27 May the EU Commission proposed a recovery package, a different solution compared to Merkel and Macron’s project. Conclusion According to the Franco-German proposal commented by Salvini, Italy will certainly have to take part in financing the European budget and the Recovery Fund integrated into it. Still, it is a pretext to call it a loan. To date, it remains undefined whether, when and how the European taxation project will take place. The expected revenues could guarantee the European Union the resources hoped for, and allow the Member States to get out of the economic crisis.

The claim turns out to be mostly false. The Coronavirus is still very present in our society. At the end of February, Mr. Van Hee claimed that the problem in Europe, like the Plague, started in Italy. Did COVID-19 enter Europe through Italy?  On the website of the World Health Organization (WHO), we found that the first European case of COVID-19 was actually found in France, not Italy. France announced their first and second cases on the 24th of January, both of them being travelers from China who passed through Wuhan. Germany followed France as the second infected European country. On the 29th of January both Italy and Finland reported their first cases. According to those data, Mr. Van Hee’s statement can already be discredited, since the virus did not enter Europe through Italy first. Although, on the website of Think Global Health we do see that 21 countries, in- and outside of Europe, got their first cases due to travelers who came from Italy. If Mr. Van Hee were to say that the Coronavirus had mostly spread through Europe because of travelers from Italy, then we could have mostly agreed with him. There are, of course, also other European countries that did not get the virus through Italy, as there are many ways of spreading it. The path of the plague to Europe In contrast to the Coronavirus, the Plague did break out further across Europe via Italy. From China, the Mongolian high plateau, the Plague reached Italy via shipping along Kaffa. Kaffa (Feodosia) is a port city and urban rayon on the Crimea. At that time it was in the hands of the Italian city of Genoa. In this way the disease hit via rats and shipping the hardest in what we now call Italy. Mr Van Hee is right about that. After the Plague landed in Genoa, the spread continued via shipping to Marseille and Barcelona. In this way the spread finally went throughout Europe. Conclusion Due to our findings, we can say that the Plague entered Europe via Italy, but that’s not the case for COVID-19. Both cases are similar because we see that Italy did play a big role in spreading both viruses. But at least for the Coronavirus they were not the first European countries to report cases. That is why we conclude that this claim is ‘mostly false’.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Noa Bayer, Hannah Erpels, Seppe Meul.

This claim is false.   Santiago Abascal is a Spanish politician that currently is the leader of the political party VOX, the main far-right wing party in Spain. VOX defends in its principles that one of their goals is the defense of the “promotion of patriotism” and the “recognition of national sovereignty corresponds to the Spanish people”. This kind of principles have made this party propose several anti-immigration measures. Abascal is one of the founders of the party, which started its political activity in 2013. Since the creation of the party, he has been leading it, being a main character in the rise of popularity of the formation. The rise of ideologically similar parties throughout Europe gave VOX their first electoral success in national elections on April 28, 2019. The party became the fifth more voted, and could enter for the very first time in the Spanish Parliament. In the same year, national elections were held again on November 10th, as there was no agreement to have a coalition government after the April results. VOX then improved their results and became the third most voted party. The statement made by Abascal was collected in an interview on February 2020, but the leader of VOX also stated similar quotes during the electoral campaigns in 2019. In this case, Santiago Abascal was interviewed in the Telediario (Daily News) of channel called La Uno, from Spanish public broadcaster Radio Televisión Española (Spanish Televisión and Radio). Some of  the topics treated during the interview were gender violence and immigration, as some of the most known measures that this party has proposed during the last year were related to both topics. During the interview, Abascal is shown a video of himself, explaining the mentioned claim.  TRANSCRIPTION OF THE INTERVIEW: “It’s useless that you (Spanish government) hide it, because there are public figures (about gender violence), that the 69% of all males accused of gang raping have been aliens, though they just represent a 10% of all Spanish population” Evidence This figure is set out in a report launched by the “Universidad Autónoma de Madrid” (Autonomous University of Madrid). This report is called “Agresores sexuales de víctima desconocida” (Sexual Assaulters of Unknown Victim). This report collects sexual assaults cases between 2009 and 2013, in which the relation between the assaulter and the victim is unknown. The report gives the following definition of what “unknown” means in this case: “when the assaulter and the victim do not know each other before the assault or they have been together earlier for a short period of time” (cuando autor y víctima no se conocen previamente a la agresión o sólo han pasado un periodo corto de tiempo juntos; p.12).  That is the main fact to disprove Abascal’s quote. When he exposes this figure, he extrapolates the sexual assaults, without mentioning the “unknown” connotation. Everytime he has claimed this sentence, he has never specified the type of assault, within the different types of attacks (domestic violence, when both assaulter and victim meet each other earlier, etc.).  Abascal bases his claim on one statement made in the report. When the report starts analyzing gang sexual assaults, there is a sentence that says, “as for the personal characteristics of the authors, there is a lower presence of Spanish aggressors (31% in group …)” (En cuanto a las características personales de los autores, hay una presencia menor de agresores españoles, 31% en grupo…, p.36. ). Nonetheless, the whole report is focused on the assaults of unknown victim (the concept explained in the paragraph above). This data, obviously, is also covered, and there are constant reminders of the type of sexual assaults the report researches, even in that same paragraph. After checking that this report would not give the accurate figures that are needed to test Abascal’s quote, another similar reports was also checked. No report was found with that exact figure, but there was another one that could give a hint about the truthfulness of Abascal’s sentence. The report analyzed is called “Informe sobre delitos contra la libertad e indemnidad sexual” (Report about crimes against sexual freedom and indemnity) , and it was launched by the Spanish Home Office. This report collects data about crimes against sexual freedom in Spain during 2017. In the report, there is a chapter focused on the profile of the assaulters. On page 28, there are some graphics about the nationality of the assaulters in all kind of sexual attacks. Clearly, the percentage shows that the number of Spanish assaulters is way higher than the alien assaulters one: Spanish assaulters (70,1%) vs. alien assaulters (29,1%). Building a bridge between these figures and the ones given by Santiago Abascal, we can discover how different both figures are. Conclusion Taking into account all data collected, we can say that the claim made by Santiago Abascal is false. First of all, we have seen how the report he uses to base his claim on is not eligible to his claim, as the report just collects data from sexual assaults where the assaulter and the victim did not know each other before. In this case, every time Abascal uses the claim, he never points out that connotation. Furthermore, we have tried to collect more data to check if that sentence could be suitable. Data about the nationality of assaulters in gang sexual attacks in Spain has not been found, but there is another figure that might help us. Collected data shows that the percentage of Spanish people that commit sexual attacks is higher than the cases that involve aliens.

In the article, the journalist Tom Le Bacq gives rates about how many people are supporting the measures of the lock down.  Barely 63 per cent of the Belgian population are supporting the measures of the lockdown, with young adults the support is less than 50 per cent. Who are these percentages based on? Tom Le Bacq mentions in Het Nieuwsblad that he has the figures from a survey carried out by the University of Ghent, Belgium, on the motivation of the Belgian population to abide by the Belgian rules of lockdown. The article also contains graphs from the study where the two percentages are clearly shown. You can find the same graphs below.       Belgium measures First of all, what exactly are these Belgian measures? The main measures correspond to the other European countries. Staying inside is the norm. In addition, you have the social distancing rule (1.5 meters distance between people), exception to this rule are the people you live with. It is allowed to meet with two people to sport outdoors or go for a walk. You must be sure that you comply with the social distancing rule and the walk must be nearby. Belgians are only allowed to use the car for essential journeys. This includes going to the supermarket, to the pharmacy, to the doctor or to work. Also, in the supermarket and pharmacy there are measures. For example, only a limited number of people may be in the shop at the same time. The measure whereby the Belgian population would mainly lose their motivation is the social distancing rule.   Marathon effort Not only Het Nieuwsblad wrote about the motivation that disappears to comply with the measures. The quality magazine Knack also talked about a marathon effort in an opinion. The author describes it as follows: “The lockdown period is beginning to weigh on many. Keeping a close eye on the measures can be compared to running a marathon. Around kilometre 30 quite a few marathon runners get a motivation dip. The light at the end of the tunnel is not yet visible and the efforts begin to weigh. That gnaws at their motivation.” The other classical media in Belgium also write about it, such as Gazet van Antwerpen and VRTNWS. Remarkably, they all use the same source: the survey of Ghent University.   “How are you doing in your room” Since 19 March, the start of the lockdown, Ghent University has been measuring the motivation of the Belgian population to comply with the measures on a daily basis. The study is based on an online survey ‘How are you doing in your room’ in which motivation, resilience and wellbeing are examined. Ghent University says that this study is necessary because the motivation of the Belgian population reflects the support for the lockdown measures and indicates to what extent the population remains willing to follow the measures. According to Maarten Vansteenkiste, moral psychologist and researcher at Ghent University, more motivation is not necessarily a better thing. There are two types of motivation: Voluntary motivation (the population remains fully convinced of the need for the measures, there adhere to the measures on their own initiative) and Compulsory motivation – ‘mustivation’ (the population feels obliged to comply with the measures, in this way you avoid a fine, criticism or disdain of others). According to the graph, this voluntary motivation is visibly declining. In the first week, 81% of the interviewees were still convinced of the measures. In the third week it was only 76% and now they speak of 63%. The study also states that the number of police interventions in Belgium is increasing, but they don’t give clear figures or percentages. The police would have to hand out more and more fines because people do not comply with the measures. Because Belgians would become more and more nonchalant in complying. The Belgian media talk about lockdown parties. The police also report on 19 April 2020 about a lockdown party they have to shut down. Also, most of the Belgians I ask if they are following the measures answer in the same way: “I am still following the measures, but no one knows how long the lockdown will last. I’m counting down to see friends and family again.” The motivation of a large number of the Belgian population has changed into mustivation.   Number of young adults The percentages are based on a number of 18,476 participants of which 74% were women. According to a study, figures for a sample hardly change from 20,000 people. The question is of course whether the percentages are then reliable. Since the figure is below 20,000. They do not write in the study how many people of each age participated. We only have a general number of participants. This means that we do not know how many participants are young adults.   Conclusion The claim is mostly true. We cannot say with certainty that the claim is completely correct. Since there is uncertainty about the number of participants that were young adults. The number of participants may also be just too few to make a statement like this. Very important is the fact that all media rely on a certain source: the survey of Ghent University. From different angles it is clear that the motivation has decreased. The survey also shows this decrease.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Alice Schoutsen    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

This was reported by the Russian online edition of RT on February 2, 2020. The claim is true. RUSSIA TODAY  reported that on February 2nd new rules for obtaining visas to the Schengen countries came into force: the new procedure makes it easier to obtain visas that facilitate tourism, trade and entrepreneurship. In their material, they refer to the message of the press service of the European Commission. To check whether this information published on the website of the Russian Internet publication RUSSIA TODAY is reliable, we turned to the official document REGULATION (EU) 2019/1155 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of June 20, 2019 amending Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) to verify the correctness of the amendments. According to the RUSSIA TODAY Internet portal, the consular fee clause touched the changes in the Visa Code:  Now the fee is from € 60 to € 80. Children under six years old still do not have a visa fee. For children from six to 12 years old, it is half the standard and therefore will increase to € 40. However, individual EU countries can now refuse to collect consular fees from minors – this is confirmed by Article 16 of the Visa Code (as amended on July 20, 2019).  Thus, we can conclude that the news presented by the Russian Internet portal RUSSIA TODAY is true.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE: Alena Rozna, Georgy Borkonyuk    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

128;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-romania-has-tripled-its-covid-19-testing-capacity/;“Romania has tripled its COVID-19 testing capacity’’;2020-05-13;eufactcheck;;“We have tripled the testing capacity of potential coronavirus patients! If a few days ago we could make 600 tests per day on average, today we can test approximately 1700 patients.” This claim by Romania’s vice prime minister Raluca Turan turns out to be mostly false.  On the 24th of March, in a Facebook update regarding the pandemic situation, the vice prime minister of Romania, Raluca Țurcan, declared that the testing capacity for COVID-19 had tripled when compared to previous days, from a daily average of 600 to 1700. This information was relayed from the Center of Strategic Communication of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, an institution set up by the government on the 24th of February to manage the looming pandemic. The claim was posted on Facebook by the vice prime minister’s official account and included a situational update regarding the situation of the pandemic in the country. In this claim, she specifies that she relayed the information from the Center of Strategic Communication, alongside other data. Sources In order to verify this claim, two sources have been used: official numbers of daily tests provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and declarations coming from Ministry of Health officials regarding the testing capacity. In this regard, on the 19th of March, an official of the Ministry of Health declared to the national newspaper Libertatea that “the testing capacity is under 100 tests per center per day. […] In this moment we can test a maximum of 700 patients per day in the country. […] But that number isn’t fixed, it’s more of an average.”. So by the 19th of March, there were an average of 700 daily tests according to this official who preferred to remain anonymous. On top of that, on the 23rd of March the National Institute of Public Health announced new testing measures to better adapt to the rising number of cases. According to a report from Digi24, which also outlines the new regulations introduced, the National Institute of Public Health claimed that the national daily testing capacity was increased to an average 1100-1200 tests per day. Number of Tests The Center of Strategic Communication offers daily information bulletins regarding the evolution of the pandemic which feature the testing numbers. For this check, we will consider the information available for the period of 2nd – 27th of March. The data from the bulletins will be used in combination with a graph released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs regarding the period of 2nd – 15th of March. As such, we have created a complete graph to illustrate the evolution of test numbers in Romania.  As can be seen, the green bars represent the total number of tests up until a certain day, and the red line indicates the difference in tests from one day to another. The spike on the 20th of March indicates the increase in testing capacity that the National Institute of Public Health mentioned, as on the 20th there were 3311 tests in a single day. On the 24th of March, the date of the claim, 1401 tests were made. However, we can calculate the average number of daily tests between the 10th of March and the 24th, which is approximately 774 tests per day, including the spike and the increase in number of tests after the 20th of March. For the period following the 20th, the average number of daily tests is 1560. Conclusion In conclusion, the vice prime minister’s claim that “Romania has tripled its testing capacity” is mostly false. Indeed, the number of daily tests had increased significantly, but it hadn’t reached the average of 1700 that was mentioned in the claim, and neither can it be said that the number tripled, but rather doubled.

And to back up his words, he quoted an interview with surgeon Joseph Hardy on Radio Shalom the same day. The doctor was worried about a new drug, Rivotril. Claim: “A (French) decree of March 28, 2020 authorizes euthanasia to get rid of the old people who would clutter up the hospitals.” Who is Gilbert Collard? He is a French lawyer and politician. He was first close to left-wing parties in his youth. Then he got close to the extreme right and the candidate Marine Le Pen. He is now a member of the European Parliament. He is often accused by the media of spreading fake news on his Twitter account.  What is this decree? On March 28, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health put in place a new decree, which complements the decree of March 23. The government’s website states that this decree prescribes “the general measures necessary to deal with the covid-19 epidemic within the framework of the state of health emergency”. The first article discusses the drug Rivotril, which is at the heart of the debate. Its primary use is to help patients who cannot be admitted to intensive care or for whom a decision has been made to limit active treatment.  What has the new decree changed? The decree relaxes the rules for prescribing the drug. Doctors in the city can for example use it on patients, whereas before it was only used in hospitals. On Twitter, Gilbert Collard announced that this decree authorized euthanasia. However, this fake news is contested by health care workers. Olivier Guérin, professor of geriatrics at the CHU of Nice said in a press release that “in this major and anguishing crisis we are living through, we cannot allow such messages to be conveyed that would suggest we euthanize our elders.” The release also states, “Administering Rivotril to a patient does not mean stopping care. On the contrary, when the situation deteriorates and in certain circumstances, it means accompanying the patient to alleviate his suffering.” Conclusion The claim is false: This decree does not allow doctors to euthanize seriously ill people with the virus, but facilitates access to Rivotril, to relieve patients at the end of life.

This statement is false.  Labour Day, May 1st, in Vienna. Austrian politicians traditionally give speeches to celebrate the achievements of the working class. On this public holiday in Austria the town hall square in the capital Vienna usually fills up with supporters of the social democratic party. Not this year.  The Covid-19-outbreak has led to a nation-wide ban on gatherings of more than ten people. So, Dominik Nepp, head of Vienna’s far-right Freedom Party and a vocal opponent of the social democratic party decided to step up and record his labour day speech from an empty town hall square (see full speech transcript). Nepp criticized the federal government’s response to the Covid-19-outbreak, arguing that “the payment of state funds was delegated to the Austrian Economic Chambers (WKO)” and that […] “to this day, not a single cent has arrived.” We tried to contact Mr. Nepp to ask him on what funds he exactly meant as well as the source of his claim.  We were unable to speak to him directly, but got a hold of Lukas Brucker, a spokesperson of the Freedom Party.  Brucker confirmed that the funds mentioned in the speech referred to the so-called “hardship case fund” (in German: “Härtefall-Fonds”); a federal government subsidy intended to help the self-employed covering their cost of living during this time of crisis. Mr. Brucker further stated: “We have the information from many businesses that they have not received anything up to this day.” However, a Vienna-based entrepreneur confirmed that he had applied and received around 1.000 Euro out of this fund before May 1st. We decided to further check this claim by asking those in charge of paying out the fund: the Austrian Economic Chambers, in short WKO, an organization representing the interests of Austria’s entrepreneurs.  Markus Kirchschlager, spokesperson of the WKO’s general secretary, explained that the Härtefall-Fonds is paid out in different phases, the first of which had been completed as of April 16th. In this first phase, a total of 121 million Euro had already been paid out.  To conclude, Dominik Nepp’s claim that until May 1st “no cent has arrived” is clearly false. Instead, at least 121 million Euro were paid out to help entrepreneurs and small business across Austria to cover their cost of living during the fallout of the Covid-19-outbreak.";https://www.fpoe-wien.at/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=901818220260846,https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20200501_OTS0005/1-mai-rede-von-vizebuergermeister-dominik-nepp-am-wiener-rathausplatz,https://www.wko.at/,https://www.wko.at/service/haertefall-fonds-phase-2.html,https://www.instagram.com/;“Not a single cent of state funds to help the self-employed cover their cost of living has arrived”;;;;;;

This claim turns out to be false.    The full tweet by Reijo Tossavainen reads: “Corona masks are recommended everywhere else but in Finland. Are the fledging government and especially The Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health issues smarter than everyone else? No way!”  Tossavainen did not respond when we tried to contact him about the source of his claim. The World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended that healthy members of the public use masks, because there is little evidence of their effectiveness as a corona prevention.  Despite the WHO statement, the masks are officially recommended in various countries. For example, in the Czech Republic and in Germany masks are urgently recommended. Sweden Reijo Tossavainen is correct that the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare are not advising the public use of the facemasks. But Finland is not the only country. For example, the Public Health Agency of Sweden states that “face masks are not needed in in the community. The best way to protect oneself and others in daily life is to maintain social distancing and good hand hygiene”.  However, it is important to note that the advice may change as countries announce new measures. For example, in The Netherlands use of masks will be compulsory in public transportation from the 1st of June on. But at the time Tossavainen uttered his claim, the Dutch government did not recommend the use of masks.  Conclusion Reijo Tossavainen’s claim is false. Finland is not the only country that doesn’t recommend the use of face masks. Neighbouring country Sweden at least doesn’t recommend masks either, as did the Netherlands until very recently.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Anastasia Ranta Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki Finland Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

132;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-female-ceos-face-greater-penalties-than-male-ceos-for-ethical-transgressions/;Female CEOs face greater penalties than male CEOs for ethical transgressions;2020-04-30;eufactcheck;;The international newspaper “Newsweek” published on 25 of October 2019 a topic titled “Female CEOs face ‘greater penalties’ than male CEOs for ethical transgressions”. The claim turns out to be uncheckable. In the article reporter Rosie McCall tries to prove the statement using the survey “How Leader Gender Influences External Audience Response to Organizational Failures“. Researchers from University of Virginia – Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen who specialize in marketing, in a summary of their study published in the “Journal of Personality and social psychology” stated: “People respond more negatively to ethical failures when an organization has a female versus a male leader.” The main reason for that outcome are gender stereotypes. Daily life situations As Polish professor who analyzes women’s participation in media, from the Department of Press Systems and Press Law at Adam Mickiewicz University Alina Balczyńska-Kosman explains:“Stereotypes are very solid cognitive structures shaped on a ground of knowledge, beliefs and expectations. Stereotypes shape specific roles, and those roles through media are becoming more present.” Professor Balczyńska-Kosman furthers their clarification:“With regards to stereotypical way of seeing women’s role in the public sphere, it is worth noticing that numerous information programs analyses indicate that media reporters use different framing depending on gender when it comes to figures on  leader positions.” This is one of the examples which sheds some light onto an issue of women’s image with regards to a more media-focused point of view.  However, it has to be noted that although the problem appears in daily life situations the Newsweek reporter previously mentioned study “How Leader Gender Influences External Audience Response to Organizational Failures” in the context of Rosie McCall statement cannot be taken without any objections. “Greater penalties”? Professor Iwetta Andruszkiewicz from the Department of Social and Economic Policy at UAM – who works as an expert for business organizations, associations and foundations which pursue projects concerning the female role – noted that the thesis was made on the basis of a hypothetical situation. Thus this particular experiment cannot be used to support the statement:Female CEOs face ‘greater penalties’ than male CEOs for ethical transgressions. The specialist also points out that “our attitude towards other people, usually is an effect of stereotypically judgemental approach and personal features. The differences in management styles are the result of gender stereotypes. One should always remember about professional competences and personality traits.” Additionally, another problem can be encountered when evaluating the phrase used in the statement –  “greater penalties” –  due to its qualitative character the statement cannot be fully checked.  Society’s expectations Nevertheless, the question which remains open is: What is the current outlook on female participation in business? Professor Iwetta Andruszkiewicz shared her statement concerning that issue: “My experience and research (and global statistics) show that we live in a world where most of the positions with significant importance in business are reserved for men, women must work very hard for their success – society expects more from them”. In conclusion this statement is uncheckable as the Newsweek reporter’s statements were based on observations not quantitative data.  This study contained very specific hypothetical situations which cannot be used to back up such a general claim that female CEOs face ‘greater penalties’ than male CEOs for ethical transgressions.

CLAIM Is Rutger Bregman correct in claiming that long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?  What were they talking about? On Friday March 20, DWDD did not start at seven o’clock as usual. It was a very rare evening on Dutch television. The Dutch King Willem-Alexander spoke to the people about COVID-19. Apart from his yearly Christmas speech, the Dutch king had not held a national speech on television since July 21, a few days after the MH17 plane crash.*) A speech like this is very unusual and special according to Carla van Baalen, professor of parliamentary history at Radboud University and director of the Centre for Parliamentary History. ‘’If the head of state holds a speech on national television apart from his Christmas speech then the circumstances in the country must be terrible’’, she says to daily Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. From his office in Huis ten Bosch, The Hague, the King spoke for seven minutes to the people about the coronavirus. He expressed words of comfort and encouraged people to stay strong during these difficult times. Read the King’s full speech here. After the Kings lasts words, the recognizable music intro of DWDD started and talk show host Matthijs van Nieuwkerk opened the show. The first thing he did was asking his guests what they thought of the speech. Discussion about the effects of the corona crisis in follow up of the King’s speech, in De Wereld Draait Door, a renown Dutch talk show. Loneliness virus One of the guests at Nieuwkerk’s table was Rutger Bregman. He is an historian and author who became an overnight social media sensation after he told billionaires at the World Economic Forum in Davos that they should stop avoiding paying tax. When it was his time to answer Nieuwkerk’s question, he started talking about what the King had said about loneliness and coronavirus: “If you are insecure and afraid, the need for contact with other people is big. You prefer familiar faces around you.Thankfully, there is still a lot we can do. We all know someone in our vicinity who will be needing people to look out for them. This is something we need to get through together and many people realize that.’’ The King ended his lines about loneliness with the message that we cannot stop the coronavirus, but we can stop the loneliness virus. ‘’Let’s make sure nobody feels abandoned.’’  Bregman agreed with the King. He said that the loneliness virus is one of the biggest challenges nowadays and continued talking about the lack of measures that the Dutch government in his eyes takes to prevent the loneliness virus. ‘’The cabinet has announced a gigantic economic stimulus package to combat an economic recession, but what we need is a social stimulus package’’, said Bregman to Nieuwkerk. He went on about loneliness as a challenge. It is deadly he said. ‘’Long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.’’ Loneliness in the Netherlands Public Health and Care.info, a website from the Dutch government that offers scientifically substantiated information about diseases, health, care and costs, published the most recent figures about loneliness in the Netherlands. In 2016, 43 per cent of the adult population (19 years and older) said that they felt lonely. Ten per cent feels serious to very serious loneliness. The definition used in this context was that loneliness is a negative situation, perceived through loss and disappointment. Loneliness is a personal, subjective experience. Feelings of loneliness mainly relate to defects in the quality of relationships. But someone can also feel lonely when the number of social contacts is lower than desired. Loneliness and smoking; the comparison Paul van de Lange, professor of Social Psychology, said to EenVandaag, that when you feel lonely you mainly need vitamin S, social relations. ‘’So you can share your feelings with someone you trust.’’ He also says that chronic loneliness can lead to depression and heart and vascular diseases. ‘’Just like smoking 15 cigarettes a day does.’’ In 2010 Julianne Holt-Lunstad published research that showed this comparison as well. In her study ‘Social Relationships and Mortality Risk’, she concluded that the influence of social relationships on risk for mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality. Lonely people are fifty per cent more likely to die prematurely than people with strong social relationships. “Humans need others to survive,” said Holt-Lunstad. ‘’Social connection is crucial to human development, health, and survival.” CONCLUSION: The claim is true: long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. * On 17 July 2014 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down and crashed in Eastern Ukraine.  All passengers and crew died. 196 passengers were from the Netherlands.

UN arbitrated, countries cannot return ‘climate migrants!”, states the title of an article published in the Croatian online news outlet Paraf.hr. The article makes a connection between the UN’s ruling that governments cannot return migrants to domicile countries where their lives are threatened by climate change, and migrants who are now in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A claim is made that these migrants will now ‘massively’ enter Croatia, and respectively into the European Union.  This statement is false as the UN’s decision on climate refugees is in no way connected to the migrants waiting to cross the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.   The thesis which we are examining was published in Croatian online news outlet Paraf.hr. On the official Facebook page it has over 15.000 followers. Contrary to other Croatian news platforms, such as Index.hr or 24hours which have over 500 thousand followers, Paraf is not that influential. Still, an article with such a clickbait potential in a title obviously has an aim to be shared over social media.  Also, author of the article is anonymous, which also causes additional doubt about the authenticity of the news outlet itself.  As for the credibility of their publishing, we contacted the biggest Croatian factchecking portal Faktograf, in order to find out the amount of incorrect information Paraf.hr had previously published.  In 2020 Faktograf had labelled two of Paraf’s articles as disinformation  (Claim that an Immigrant’s Child Threatens Europeans with Slaughter is False , and A Well-known Journalist is Deceitfully Portrayed as an Immigrant who had Moved to Ireland Because of Corruption) The title of the article in question is certainly a piece of disinformation because the migrants that are currently in Bosnia and Herzegovina can by no means be connected with the climate migrants. The thesis has been derived from a CNN story about the decision of United Nations on climate refugees.  While CNN story focuses only on the UN ruling on climate refugees and doesn’t make any connection with the current migrations from Middle East to the Western Europe,  Paraf.hr draws the following conclusion:  “Many political commentators consider this an important decision as it  can spark a flood of legal requests of displaced persons around the world. This particularly is a threat to Croatia in whose neighbourhood tens of thousands of migrants are waiting for spring and new attempt of crossing the border, in order to cross to Western Europe.” Of course, not one single “political commentator” is mentioned or quoted by name.  Who are the migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina became in mid-2018 the new transit route for migrants who are on their way to Western Europe. According to the European Parliament briefing (November 2019), there were about eight thousand migrants from southern Asia and the Middle East.  All of them are migrants who had made their way all the way to the border with Croatia, trying to make their way further into the European Union.  Since the legal crossing of the border is not possible, thousands of migrants have been settled in camps near the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia.  According to the 2018 UN Report on migrant and refugees situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the number of migrants in that region has been growing since 2017. The countries of origin of those migrants are mainly: Syria, Libya, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iran, Algeria, and Iraq. Who are the climate refugees according to the UN decision?  Climate refugees, as defined by the UN and its agency for refugees (UNHCR) are people who are forced to leave their country because of sudden or gradual ecological changes linked to global climate change like: raise of the sea level, extreme weather changes, drought, lack of water, and similar.  Because of such conditions, according to the UN, forcing refugees to return into countries in which the climate crisis is directly threatening their lives, constitutes the violation of their human rights.  Kiribati as the trigger for UN decision             According to the CNN story, the reason for passing such a decision is the case of Ioanea Teitiotea, a man who requested protection of New Zealand after his life was in jeopardy because of climate changes in his country Kiribati.  Although his request was first rejected, the fear of consequences of the climate changes was the trigger for this UN’s ruling. Namely, because of significant raise of the sea level, which has been estimated to almost three millimetars per year since 1993, Kiribati has become very endangered. According to the Iberdola statistics this territory is only two meters above the sea level.  In 1999 two islands that are part of Kiribati remained submerged.  Also, the storms created a number of other problems – the sea waters hitting the land affecting the drinking water, flooding houses, and destroying crops.  If this situation continues, the inhabitants of Kiribati will have the right to request the status of climate refugees, because all criteria of the UN decision are present – influence of the climate changes, lack of water and food, which brings the population in danger, and violates their basic human rights. How can the decision on climate refugees influence the current situation?         The very title of  Paraf’s article creates the wrong impression that this decision will enable the migrants and refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina to  settle easier in Croatia.  That is incorrect because the status of climate refugees can only be granted to persons whose lives are directly threatened by extreme climate changes in their countries, which automatically jeopardies their right to life.  Migrations caused by wars in their respective countries, although also life threatening,  do not constitute a prerequisite for UN definition of climate refugees. This article has also been checked by Croatian fact-checking website Faktograf, and according to their analysis, it has also been established that it is a false claim, because lives of refugees coming from the Middle East are not endangered by climate change. Indeed, there is no connection between the UN’s decision on climate refugees and the wave of migrations from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia, and via Croatia to the Western Europe. Therefore, the thesis from the title of the article is not only false, but is an example of a classical clickbait, which misleads readers.

The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) is gripping the world. At the moment we still know very little about this virus, which lives under several names. One thing we all hope is that the virus will disappear as quickly as it has spread around the world. According to Dutch politician Thierry Baudet, who leads the right-wing party ‘Forum voor Democratie’, the virus will die automatically when the weather outside gets better. He makes this claim in an interview with the Dutch journalist Joost Niemoller. We investigated whether this statement is actually correct. This appears not to be the case. We investigated whether this statement is actually correct. This appears not to be the case. Thierry Baudet made a striking statement in an interview with journalist Joost Niemoller: “We know that if the weather gets better, especially with the sea wind, a happy circumstance we have here, the virus will die.” But is this really the case? Does the Coronavirus die automatically when the weather gets better? In the interview, Mr Baudet claims the Coronavirus will die on its own when the weather improves. This statement may look like a prediction, but he clearly says, “We know that…”. With the use of these words he implies that he is talking about facts that are supported by scientific research. No further source is mentioned to back up this claim. Mr. Baudet himself is not an expert in the field of virology, he studied law and is a politician. We first tried to contact Thierry Baudet through his party to ask on what source(s) he based his statement. The party did not respond to our request, so the sources he used to back up his statement cannot be verified.   American study Indeed, the common flu does not thrive as temperatures rises. This was shown seven years ago in an American study called “Environmental Predictors of Seasonal Influenza Epidemics across Temperate and Tropical Climates”. In this study it was shown that viral infections show a strongly seasonal cycle, with fewer infections occurring with rising temperatures and higher humidity in countries with a climate such as the Netherlands. In this case, the arrival of spring should therefore be beneficial for the decrease in the number of infections, but of course COVID-19 does not yet appear in this study. This research also shows that the viruses do not have to be completely gone when it gets warmer outside. Virologist Ab Osterhaus, lecturer at the Erasmus University, tells Dutch news website Nu.nl the same thing. According to him, most viruses like Corona that lead to respiratory infections mainly exist in the winter months. This doesn’t say the Coronavirus will behave the same way, but Osterhaus thinks it is highly likely. He confirms that human behaviour could have an impact on the spread of the disease, because people will be closer together in buildings during colder months. Warmer places Comparing the statements of these three experts and the study, one can see a clear pattern. Viruses similar to COVID-19 do not thrive particularly well as the temperature and the humidity rise. However, this doesn’t mean the virus will disappear in its entirety. People could still get infected and it’s not clear whether COVID-19 will behave the same as the viruses it is compared to. Also, warmer places like Sint Maarten still have to deal with the consequences of the virus. That shows that the virus is still active when it is hotter outside. For this reasons Baudets statement, “The virus will die automatically when the weather outside gets better”, is labelled as ‘Largely False’. It is correct the virus will most likely become less infectious as the days grow warmer, but scientific research clearly shows the virus will not completely disappear.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7NXS3ntYtM&feature=youtu.be,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003194,https://www.nu.nl/coronavirus/6032793/gaan-lentetemperaturen-ons-beschermen-tegen-het-coronavirus.html?redirect=1,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/buitenland/artikel/5082831/coronavirus-antillen-cariben-curacao-sint-maarten,https://www.instagram.com/;“The Coronavirus will die when the weather improves”;;;;;;

The French President made a television appealto the nation because of the spread of coronavirus infection. The Russian media reports that Macron indicated in his message, that the borders of the European Union and the Schengen countries were closed from March 17 for up to 30 days. The French leader noted that the restriction on the movement of people across the country came into force for 15 days. According to the president’s statement, all reforms were also be suspended in France, including pension reform, which involves the abolition of retirement benefits for many professions, raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. In order to check this information, we visited the Government of France official website.The main page contains basic information about coronavirus infection and measures taken by the government for the safety of citizens. After scrolling downwards, you can see the section «Ressources et contacts utiles» and in the tab «Documents» there is a function «Téléchargez la déclaration du président de la République 16 mars 2020» (download the statement of the President of the Republic of March 16, 2020) . In this statement, the president announced a restriction on the movement of people and the suspension of reforms: «…Dès demain midi et pour 15 jours au moins, nos déplacements seront fortement réduits…», «…Toutes les réformes en cours sont suspendues à commencer par la réforme des retraites…». The following is said about closing the borders: «…pour nous protéger et contenir la dissémination du virus mais aussi préserver nos systèmes de soin, nous avons pris une décision commune en européen : dès demain midi : les frontières à l’entrée de l’Union Européenne et de l’espace Schengen seront fermées. Concrètement, tous les voyages entre les pays non européens et l’Union européenne seront suspendus» (in order to protect us and to restrain the spread of the virus, as well as to preserve our healthcare systems, we made a joint decision in Europe: tomorrow morning: the borders at the entrance to the European Union and the Schengen area will be closed. Specifically, all trips between non-European countries and the European Union will be suspended). The statement did not indicate a deadline for closing the borders up to 30 days, however, information appeared on the website that on March 27, 2020 the Prime Minister announced the extension of restrictive measures for another two weeks, that is, until April 15 using the same rules as currently.

The trade agreement between Europe and Vietnam concerns an agreement on import and export tariffs between Vietnam and Europe. The goal is to eliminate 99% of these tariffs within seven years. Vietnamese exports to Europe will increase by fifteen billion euros per year by 2035. This contrasts with annual growth in European exports to Vietnam of around 8.3 billion euros. Adding these two together, 14.000 new, well-paid jobs will be created per billion euros of exports. Other sources Where the figure 14.000 exactly comes from was at first a mystery to us. However, In a dossier of the European Commission, there is a summary of the achievements concerning jobs and exports between Europe and the rest of the world. In 2011 every billion euros of exports effectively created 14.000 new jobs, thus the European Commission. The first step towards answers had been taken. The number 14.000 has, in fact, an origin. Since the document is from 2011, it’s pretty dated so we went looking for other sources. In a file from 2017 of the FEB (Federation of Enterprises in Belgium), which is the largest employers’ organization in Belgium lobbying for a healthy economy, we found the same statement. They probably use the numbers of the European Commission, but we were unable to contact the FEB. Old stuff Two ‘confirmations’ about the numbers. So the chance that they are complete nonsense is almost zero. But still we encounter doubts. Because why exactly 14.000 and not 140.000 or 8.000 new jobs. To find out we contacted the cabinet of Geert Bourgeois. It emerged from that contact that Bourgeois based his statement on an earlier one made by the former President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. That, once again leads us to the same number: one billion euros in exports creates 14,000 new jobs in the EU. But where did Juncker base his statement on? In other words, again, where did the 14.000 come from? The Bourgeois cabinet provided us with a link to the details of those figures. However, a really conclusive answer is not given here on where those 14.000 jobs come from. But it’s the closest we can get to conclusive truth. Conclusion We can conclude that the claim is ‘Mostly true’. There are many different articles that quoted the figures based on the article by the European Commission. The claim was correct in 2011 but over the last few years, that figure will probably have changed. This allows us to conclude that the claim is mostly true because in the end we only have one source and several years have passed since the article by the European Commission was published.

Vox’s leaders, Javier Ortega Smith and Santiago Abascal claim “there is no interest in proving that men die in women’s hands as well” while arguing that “the current law on gender-based violence has not reduced the number of women killed”. Their discourse is based on data that, once analyzed, turn out to be false. In recent years, populist and extreme right-wing movements have gained a presence across Europe. They are opposed to movements such as feminism, a fact that worries the European Parliament because the context before the May 2019 elections showed how Vox and other populist or Eurosceptic parties consider gender policies as a threat to men. Before the elections last May, the possibility was raised, for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, that the far right and the Eurosceptics would form an influential parliamentary block. Vox is an ultra-right-wing, ultra-nationalist Spanish political party that was formed in 2013. Its leader, Santiago Abascal, was the alderman of the People’s Party in the Basque Country. The party has been criticized for having populist, sexist, xenophobic and reactionary ideas. It began to gain popularity in 2018 and it is currently the third largest force in the Congress of Deputies, Spain’s highest legislative body. In the European Parliament, parties with extreme right-wing ideas have been grouped into three groups: Identity and Democracy (ID), led by Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini; European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), the most numerous and varied, which includes Vox; and the European People’s Party (EPP). The most threatening fact is that in 22 of the 27 EU Member States there is a growing presence of such parties. Source: own elaboration (data from European Parliament). The 15% of votes obtained by Vox in the last Spanish elections (52 seats) positioned them as the third political force in the country, adding even more presence to the parliamentary representation of the ultra-right in European countries. In social media, European leaders reacted to these results. For example, Matteo Salvini congratulated Abascal on Twitter for “the great advance of Vox’s friends, neither racism nor fascism, we just want to live peacefully in our own home”. Here we can see the close links between the different right-wing parties in Europe, as well as the justification of their speech. The speeches of Vox in Spain are being debated among citizens but also in the media as well. Political parties that make up their opposition constantly accuse them of falsifying data or relying on manipulated statistics. Many of Vox’s discourses are sexist or discriminatory in the grounds of gender; that is why among the Spanish feminist movement there is growing concern and an attempt to delegitimize them. Bearing this in mind, we have analyzed three claims:  “We want to propose a law on domestic violence because for us violence has no gender”. Javier Ortega Smith, Interview in Cadena Ser (December 5, 2018; Minute: 3.52). “Data on men dying at the hands of women are not provided. They are hidden because there is no interest in proving that men die in women’s hands as well”. Javier Ortega Smith, Interview in Cadena Ser (December 5, 2018; Minute: 7.46). “The current law on gender-based violence has not reduced the number of women killed”. Santiago Abascal, Debate in the Spanish Public Television (November 4, 2019).  We have chosen these three statements that address the legal issue of the current law on gender-based violence. Firstly, they state that this law is useless, they also raise doubts about objective data and blame that there is no interest in showing that women kill men and, according them, this is the reason why data are not correct. Finally, they also denounce the insufficiency or uselessness of the law on gender violence, arguing that it has not contributed to reduce the number of women murdered. “We want to propose a law on domestic violence because for us violence has no gender” In its political programme, Vox defends the repeal of the law against gender violence and of any “rule that discriminates against another sex”. This directly implies a statement: the law of gender violence, for them, discriminates against the male sex. This argument is based on a misconception that denies reality: the number of women abused and murdered at the hands of men is far greater than the number of men who suffer this type of violence. According to a report by the expert group on domestic and gender violence of the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary, the victims of abuse are mostly women. The study on sentences for murder of a partner or former partner reveals that between 2016 and 2018 there were 151 murders of women who died at the hands of their male partner or ex-partner compared to 25 men, 4 of whom were killed by people of the same gender. That is, 86% of those killed were women and 88% of the assailants were men. This data – consistent with the pattern of the period 2008-2016– show that it is mostly men, from the position of power legitimized by the patriarchy, who murder women. Source: own elaboration (data from the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary) “Data on men dying at the hands of women are not provided. They are hidden because there is no interest in proving that men die in women’s hands as well” Precisely, the General Council of the Judiciary, for more than a decade, has been compiling in public annual reports both the number of men and women who die in the field of domestic violence at the hands of their partners or former partners. In fact, we can see the data in the previous infographic. In addition, Cadena Ser tried to disprove Vox’s discourse, so we observe that some national media maintain critical distance from the party’s position. However, as Antoni Rodon, lecturer of political science at Pompeu Fabra University highlights, the rise of right-wing parties has generated a “media boom”. New parties, such as Vox, have taken advantage of the situation and have capitalized on their growing space in the media to disseminate their positions. “The current law on gender-based violence has not reduced the number of women killed” Vox’s third claim is also false because since the Organic Law 1/2004 of 28 December on Integrated Protection Measures against Gender Violence was passed, the number of deaths has been reduced. According to the Government Delegation for Gender Violence, which is the body that keeps track of the number of deaths due to gender violence, the following data are provided: on 2003 there were 72 deaths from gender-based violence, while in 2019 there were 55. Moreover, if we consider the average number of women killed in the first eight years (2004-2011) that the law was in force, the figure rises to 67 women, while in the last eight years (2012-2019) the average is 53. With these data we can say that the number of gender violence murders has been substantially reduced since the existence of this law. We conclude that Vox’s extreme right-wing speeches threaten the feminist movement. It is essential that media organizations provide arguments against this type of speeches, thus contributing to stop the spread of disinformation. The best way to counteract these discourses is by contrasting the information political parties use to justify their arguments. Bearing in mind the aforementioned checks, we can state that Vox’s claims on gender violence are false.

139;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-eu-standards-for-energy-efficiency-have-an-effect-outside-of-the-eu/;“EU standards for energy-efficiency have an effect outside of the EU”;2020-03-24;eufactcheck;;In Knack VIP (paywall), a Belgian weekly, Tomas Wyns said: “If the European Union sets standards for the energy-efficiency of electric devices, it also has an effect outside of the EU.” Wyns is a researcher at the Institute for European Studies, which is linked with Brussels’ university. His claim turns out to be true. The European Union has imposed regulations considering the energy-efficiency of electric devices in the past, and will very likely continue to do so in the future. The manufacturers of electric appliances, inside as well as outside of the EU, have to meet those demands in order to be able to offer their products on the market, says Wyns, who specializes in climate and industrial policy and the innovation strategies that could be applied in these sectors.  Ecodesign requirements The standards Wyns refers to are more commonly known as ‘ecodesign requirements’. Concretely, these are demands set by the EU for the energy-efficiency of electric devices, in order to improve their ecology and sustainability. The requirements can either be specific (e.g. a minimum value of recycled material) or generic (e.g. the product is recyclable). The ecodesign requirements apply to a variety of electric appliances (e.g. boilers, computers, refrigerators, etc.). If any of these products fails to meet the standards, it can’t be distributed in the European Union. Hence, every electric device you own meets the standards, whether the producer is European, American, Japanese or based in any other country. Going from your South-Korean Samsung-television over your American iPhone to your German Siemens’ washing machine, every single one of these products has to fulfil the EU’s demands.  The Brussels effect Wyns’ claim is based upon the ‘Brussels effect’ theory. This theory states that non-EU countries are inclined to copy rules set by the European Union, because of Europe’s market size and importance. Foreign manufacturers might miss a lot of profit if they don’t live up to the EU’s demands and, as a result, can’t offer their products on the European market. So, the Brussels effect is a proven and repeated market mechanism. In fact, the European Union has the power to de facto, not necessarily de jure, manifest its laws outside its borders. The EU itself is also aware of this market mechanism. However, the European Union stresses that its regulations do not obligatory apply to non-EU countries nor will they automatically be copied by non-EU member states. On the other hand, the European Union also experiences that other countries look up at Europe and take a leaf out of its book when it comes to developing their own policies considering ecodesign. REACH, EU-regulations for the registration, evaluation and admission of chemical products, is an already existing example illustrating the Brussels effect. South Korea partly adopted the European Union’s plan, made some adjustments and called their version K-REACH. Conclusion Wyns’ claim is based upon a proven and acknowledged market mechanism. On top of that, the European Union itself has experienced other countries adopting their regulations and therefore also recognises this phenomenon. In conclusion, Wyns’ claim is based on facts and supported by the European government. Therefor it is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Among his wishes, and retrospective of 2019, he stated that “more than 500,000 jobs were created since May 2017” (the quote is stated at 1.49), this date marking the start of his mandate.  So, is this affirmation true? After doing some research on row numbers, it turns out it is.     IMAGE: screenshot taken from the new year’s speech by President Macron, on the 31st of December 2019. The full speech can be seen here.  The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) conducts yearly trimester studies on jobs creation. Taking into account only the last two trimesters of 2017 (trimester 3 and trimester 4) -as Mr Macron started his mandate almost mid-year- that is about 117,200 of jobs created. For the year 2018, the statistics show that 149,600 jobs were created (this is combined total of trimester 1, trimester 2, trimester 3 and trimester 4). Finally, still according to the Insee, the number goes up to 263,000 for 2019 (here are the numbers for trimester 1, trimester 2 and trimester 3) so far.  The study for the last trimester of 2019 will be released in March, but the three trimesters suffice to get an overall number of 529,800 for the three years since May 2017, when Macron took office.  Newspaper Le Monde added an Insee statistic of jobs that were created between the end of the third trimester and the end of the year 2019, which is not yet officially released. Its is to be noted that the numbers include both the private and public sectors; and take into account the loss of jobs.

141;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-nobody-has-died-because-of-contamination-claims-madrids-most-powerful-politician/;“Nobody has died because of contamination”, claims Madrids’ most powerful politician;2020-02-19;eufactcheck;;“​Nobody has died because of contamination. I mean, I do not want to create a health public alarm, because we are not at that level”, said Isabel Díaz Ayuso, President of the Community of Madrid in an interview in CadenaSER, a Spanish national radio broadcaster, on the 1st of January 2020. Her allegation, that nobody in Madrid has died because of contamination, is incorrect. Who is  Isabel Díaz Ayuso? Isabel Díaz Ayuso is a Spanish politician who is currently part of ​Partido Popular​ (Popular Party), the most influential right-wing party in Spain. She is specialized in Political Communication and most of her work in her party has been around this issue. Díaz Ayuso ran with some regional campaigns in the communications area and she has worked as a spokesperson in the Assembly of the Community of Madrid. In 2019, she was chosen as the leader of her party’s election list and she won the regional elections in May 2019. Díaz Ayuso was invited on New Year’s Day to CadenaSER, a Spanish radio broadcaster. During her interview, one of the debated topics was the case of (air) pollution in Madrid. Pollution is a hot topic in both the city and Community of Madrid mainly because of many projects that are going on to reduce it. One measure was taken by the former mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena​, and is ​a law that restricts traffic in the capital city of Spain, in order to decongest the city from pollution. This measure has been criticized by  Díaz Ayuso’s political party, and is one of the corner stones in the 2019 election campaign. Therefore, the current President was asked about this topic during the radio broadcast. Context of the claim During her interview,  Díaz Ayuso made some quotes about pollution that made a huge impact in Spanish media: “Nobody has died because of contamination. I mean, I do not want to create a health public alarm, because we are not at that level. Madrid is one of the cities in the world with the greatest longevity, with one of the best public transport systems. People are not going to die. Taking into account how this topic is usually shown, I do not think it is real”. The video of the interview is in Spanish and can be seen on YouTube, the quote can be heard on the 18:58 timestamp. Transcription of the interview Journalist of CadenaSER: “There has to be a balance between the ones who wants to enter to Madrid and the ones  who live in Madrid, in downtown, and do not want to die polluted.”  Isabel Díaz Ayuso: “Sure, but that (the balance) obviously is always going to exist. Nobody has died because of this. I mean, I do not want to create a health public alarm because there is not in Madrid. Madrid is one of the cities with the greatest longevity in the world, with one of the best public transport systems, and there are renewing more and more boilers and vehicles. The most important thing is to keep boosting use of public transport, because they voluntarily want, to pedestrianise those special areas that might be important touristically, etc. Cities are going to be more and more destined to this scenario, and is obvious that we have to reach to this point. But, no one is going to die, taking into account how this topic is shown, I do not think it is real. Obviously nobody likes pollution and we have to stop it little by little, but Madrid, in this topic, I think is doing things properly and the idea is keep on for greener and cleaner cities.“ Response to Diaz Ayuso’s claim As  Díaz Ayuso made this statement, Spanish media put this polemic claim on all front pages, and of course, it had consequences. The current mayor of the city of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida (from Díaz Ayuso’s same political party) defended her colleague, highlighting that “no one said that Díaz Ayuso denied that relation” and that her claim was taken “out of context”. Martínez-Almeida also blamed left parties as “they have taken just a sentence and not the whole context”.In the opposition, left wing party PSOE showed their concern about  Díaz Ayuso’s declaration, as she is “undermining the effects pollution causes”. They also branded as “terrible and pathetic Díaz Ayuso’s ignorance and frivolity”. Evidence After fact-checking this claim, there is no doubt that this is a false allegation.  In order to dismantle it, there are several reports that give scientific evidence of the relationshipbetween pollution and rise of death.  First of all, we will start with worldwide data. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report in 2018, having data collected in 2016, that atmospheric pollution provokes around 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide. This mortality is due to exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM 2.5), which cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. Then, we got data about this health problem on a European level. This report has been checked, as WHO claims that the 91% of 4.2 million premature deceases are mainly focused in South-East Asia and Pacific Regions. In March 2019, the European Health Journal magazine estimated that 790.000 people died prematurely from air pollution in Europe. Finally, there are also national reports that deny  Díaz Ayuso’s version. In 2018, DKV insurance company released a detailed report about the Spanish situation in pollution terms. The report, called El aire que respiras: la contaminación atmosférica en las ciudades (PDF, “The air you breath: atmospheric pollution in cities”), calculated that around 100.000 people died during 2000-2009 due to health problems derived from atmospheric pollution. From this 100.000 deaths, 16.000 corresponded to Madrid.  IMAGE: Graphic of different number of premature deaths in Spain during 2000-2009 period. Source: National Health School of Carlos III Health Institute (you have to register to download the full report that includes the graphic).  Conclusion Going back to  Díaz Ayuso’s claim, “nobody has died because of contamination”. In order to prove the reliability of this affirmation, several global, European and Spanish reports have been checked. In all of them, the main outcome is the high amount of premature deaths provoked by atmospheric pollution. Every year, 4.2 million people die worldwide because of contamination. In Europe, this number almost reached the 800.000 barrier. Around 100.000 suffered the consequences of polluted air in Spain during the 2000-2009 period. 16.000 from 100.000 pollution-related deaths occured in Madrid, the province  Díaz Ayuso’s is the president of. To sum up, the claim from the President of the Community of Madrid is false. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

As the European Union, we are responsible for this.’’  Was Huitema correct to affirm that no action was taken to save these animals?    Image: screenshot from a video posted on the official Facebook page of Jan Huitema on 19 December 2019  Who said what? While talking in the European Parliament about animal transport within, to and from the EU, Member of the European Parliament Jan Huitema, criticized the institutions’ lack of action facing some delicate cases. He used as an example the incident in Romania, where 14,600 sheep drowned along the coast of the country due to a shipwreck. According to the politician, no action was taken to prevent or save the animals.  What happened? According to The New York Times, the vessel Queen Hind was taking the animals to a buyer in Saudi Arabia when it partly capsized. The cause of the ship’s capsizing is still a mystery. Romania’s transport minister, Lucian Bode, ordered an investigation, saying “we cannot allow such events to be repeated.” The ship is registered in Palau, and news reports have said it was managed by a Romanian company, but officials have not confirmed the ownership.  Sheep at sea While the ship’s crew of 21 was quickly rescued, thousands of animals remained on board. After one day, the Romanian government called off any rescue efforts, but animal welfare workers continued and decided to enter the ship on their own. Global animal rights organisation Four Paws and the local Romanian organisation ARCA, two major organizations, were able to save 254 sheep out of the 14,600 on board, but, because of the unstable conditions, the operation had been made difficult. “The rescue mission wasn’t a simple one, or a risk-free one,” said Raed Arafat in The New York Times, head of the Department of Emergency Situations under the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs. He said that more than 100 people a day were involved in the operation, including members of the water rescue agency.  Could be avoided? The disaster has raised fresh questions about transporting live animals by sea. An estimated two million sheep and one million cattle are transported each year from European Union member states to the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. Romania is one of the main exporters. Animal rights advocates say that the journeys are often too long, regulations aren’t up to scratch and the rules are often flouted. “The vast majority of journeys, despite what the European Commission says, involve breaches of the law”, said Peter Stevenson, a veteran lawyer and chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming, an animal welfare organization based in Britain.   “That a ship should capsize quite near to the port suggests that the inspection was not carried out properly”, he added. Francesca Porta, the farm animals program officer at the advocacy group Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels, said that one of the main problems was that vessels were often not built for the journey. “They are old vessels that are converted to transport animals”, Porta said. The Queen Hind, she added, had been built in 1980 and reauthorized by Romanian officials in March. The vessel had suffered engine failure in the Sea of Marmara near Turkey in 2018, news reports said. Days before this specific accident, Eurogroup issued a report laying out a strategy to reduce and replace the transportation of live animals with a meat-and-carcass-only trade.   “In the end, we believe that this trade must be stopped”, said group’s director Reineke Hameleers. She affirmed that it is high time for the Commission to intervene, both by tackling maladministration by Romania and by putting forward a concrete strategy to replace live transport with a meat and carcasses only trade.  ConclusionEven though the politician is partially correct when saying that EU didn’t participated directly in the rescuing mission of these animals, he is incorrect to say that “no action was taken” to save these sheep, since animal welfare groups worked several days trying to rescue the sheep.

On January 9, The British newspaper The Independent claimed in their article Brexit: Don’t settle for ‘isolation’, EU president tells Britain’s youth covering EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s visit to London that it certainly was not the youth. ‘’Poll suggest wide majorities in favour of EU membership among younger and working-age demographics, with Brexit only carried over the line by the retired.’’, the paper wrote without referencing directly what exactly this poll shows or where the poll was from or who made it. After fact checking this claim, it is clear that it is in fact true that the younger voters favour EU membership whilst the older generation does not. Several polls back claim  When asked by EUfactcheck, journalist Jon Stone, who is the author of the piece, pointed in the direction of an article by the BBC from August 2018. The article, which is written by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, states that just over 70 per cent of the 18 to 24 year-olds who voted in the referendum in 2016 backed remain according to ‘’four major academic and commercial polls conducted shortly after the ballot agree’’. On the other hand, only 40 per cent of those aged 65 or more voted remain. At the time the BBC article was published, the polarisation was even bigger. According to the average of four polls by Survation, 82% of the 18 to 24 year-olds with a voting preference would vote remain in a second referendum whilst only around 33% of the 65+ group would back remain. A YouGov poll from June 2016, with a sample size of 5455 UK adults, backs these figures. The poll shows that 71% of the votes from people under 25 were in favour of remaining, whilst only 36% of the 65+ group voted to remain.   eufactcheck 2Infogram Independent pro-remain It is not surprising that The Independent made a pro-EU claim such as this one when considering their general coverage of Brexit. An analysis by Loughborough University published on 14 June 2016 of 1127 ‘’media cuttings’’ since the day of the EU membership referendum in 2016 show that the articles regarding Brexit published by The Independent tended to be supportive of remaining in the EU. The newspaper was in this period one of the most ‘’balanced’’ and ‘’neutral’’ newspapers in the United Kingdom, but the analysis also showed that The Independent was one of five papers to back remain.  Untitled infographicInfogram CONCLUSIONSo to conclude, it was true when Independent claims that the younger part of the demographic in the UK are in favour of EU membership.

145;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-hungarian-constitution-includes-jailing-homeless-people/;Hungarian constitution includes jailing homeless people;2020-02-05;eufactcheck;;Pastor Gábor Iványi, rival of the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, has published a text the “Advent Statement” in which he denounces Orban’s policy. In an interview, he criticizes this “Christian country” for having a constitution in which one can be put in prison for being homeless. He is right.  In the Guardian article « The pastor versus the populist: Hungary’s new faith faultline », published the 29th of December, Julian Coman interviewed the Pastor Gábor Iványi. The journalist confirms to me that Iványi said to him: “Is there any other Christian country in the world where it is written in the constitution that you can be jailed for being homeless?” Pastor Gábor Iványi  Now at the head of the Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship, Gábor Iványi was once close to the Hungarian prime minister. As students the two fought together against the communist regime. Orban converted to Catholicism and asked the pastor to bless his marriage and baptized his children. As a result of political tensions and Orban’s rise to power, the two men drifted apart. In 2011, the Parliament excluded the Hungarian Evangelical Association from the list of state-recognised religious institutions. Gábor Iványi lost its subsidies. Today, the pastor criticizes Orban’s use of religion.   Imprecise figures In Hungary, according to the Act III of 1993 on social administration and social services, a homeless person is described as “any person shall be deemed to be homeless who spends nights in public areas or premises not designed for housing purposes” (PDF download link). Concerning the number of homeless people, the figures are not always accurate. In 2018, the European Federation of National Organizations with the Homeless (FEANTSA) statistics show that 8,650 Hungarians are homeless. However, they point out that these figures only include undocumented migrants who are in contact with organizations and NGOs. Regarding the number of homeless people put in jail, the numbers are even more imprecise.  A controversial Constitution In the country’s history, the first written constitution dates back to 1949. It was only in 2011 that the government decided to introduce a new constitution, entitled The Fundamental Law of Hungary, which was adopted by Parliament in April. But this text has been amended many times. In 2013, the government first passed a law that made it a criminal offence to sleep in certain public places, which were protected as Hungary’s World Heritage Sites.  In October 2018, the new amendment to article 22 of the Constitution (PDF, in English) will strengthen the crackdown on the homeless. The new article introduces:  “In order to protect public order, public safety, public health and cultural artefacts, an Act or a local government decree may, with respect to a specific part of public space, provide that using a public space as a habitual dwelling shall be illegal.” Contacted by email, Warren Richardson, a freelance photojournalist working with homeless people in Budapest, explains the situation: “Any homeless person found sleeping on the streets – that is an imprisonable offence, giving authorities the right to move that person as a warning and a second time the authorities have the right to imprison and destroy the persons belongings.” That same month, the government published a post on its official website entitled “There are sufficient places for those in need”, in order to justify these new rules. It states: “the act of residing on public premises for habitation illegal will enter into force on 15 October.”   Conclusion In an interview with the journalist of The Guardian, the Pastor Gábor Iványi said that “it is written in the constitution that you can be jailed for being homeless» about the Hungarian Constitution. Indeed, the amendment to the article 22 of the Constitution adopted in 2018, the text says that living in the public space can be illegal. The claim is true.

According to EU environmental laws domestic cats should be banned from roaming outside since they are a danger to wildlife. This was originally claimed by two law-researchers of the university of Tilburg in an article in the Journal of Environmental Law (Oxford Academic). By looking at EU environmental laws and siding this with data about the effect of domestic cats on wildlife researchers Arie Trouwborst and Han Somsen came to the conclusion that member states are obligated to ban cat-owners from letting their cats roam outside. In the article’s conclusion the authors write: “It is well recognised that biodiversity loss is one of the most urgent contemporary crises, in Europe as much as globally. It is also well established that free-ranging domestic cats pose a significant threat to European biodiversity. Stray and feral cats are to be removed or controlled when they pose a threat to protected species and/or sites. Regarding pet and farm cats, the Nature Directives require EU Member States to ensure that letting them roam free is forbidden and effectively prevented.”  >>  Arie Trouwborst, Han Somsen, Domestic Cats (Felis catus) and European Nature Conservation Law—Applying the EU Birds and Habitats Directives to a Significant but Neglected Threat to Wildlife, Journal of Environmental Law, , eqz035, https://doi.org/10.1093/jel/eqz035 It sounds plausible but is it true? According to the Dutch bureau of the European Commission it is not. The bureau posted the following statement on Twitter: “We are not going to ask cat-owners to keep their cats on a leash. According to our information cats are not the biggest threat to #biodiversity.”   IMAGE: screenshot taken on 15 January 2020, from the Twitter account of Europa in Nederland (the Dutch Bureau of the European Commission), in response to a news article from NOS (the Dutch public broadcaster.   In combination with data on the, according to them, catastrophic effect that pet cats have on wildlife Trouwborst and Somsen mainly based their conclusion on two articles of law. The first is the 2009 Birds Directive and the second is the 1997 Habitat Directive.  The Birds Directive states: “Member States shall take the requisite measures to maintain the population of the species referred to in Article 1 at a level which corresponds in particular to ecological, scientific and cultural requirements, while taking account of economic and recreational requirements, or to adapt the population of these species to that level.” The Habitat Directive states: “Ensure that the deliberate introduction into the wild of any species which is not native to their territory is regulated so as not to prejudice natural habitats within their natural range or the wild native fauna and flora and, if they consider it necessary, prohibit such introduction. The results of the assessment undertaken shall be forwarded to the committee for information.” CONCLUSIONAccording to the researchers’ interpretation of the Directives mentioned above, because cats are not native to Europe and they cause a lot of harm to environment they should either be removed or controlled when roaming outside. However, the articles taken from the Habitat and Bird directive can be interpreted in several ways. The European Commission does not agree with the conclusion made by the two law researchers. The way to interpret these articles is up for debate which makes the claim uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

This news was written using research from consumer collective United Consumers.  IMAGE: screenshot, taken on 16 January 2020, from the news article in De Telegraaf with the claim that the Dutch pay the most for Euro 95 petrol CLAIMIs Telegraaf correct by claiming that in the Netherlands you pay the highest amount of money for Euro 95 petrol in Europe? Who wrote what?The news was written in De Telegraaf, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the Netherlands. They represent the voice of the ordinary Dutch men, who is so often mentioned but rarely heard. Mariëtte Wolf, who was awarded her doctoral degree with a thesis on the history of De Telegraaf, states that the newspaper is always in search for noise and makes as much news as possible. The journalistic style is according to her very progressive in terms of choice, subject and layout.  However, De Telegraaf used United Consumers research as their primary source. This is a Dutch consumer collective for individuals. With the collective they can offer their consumers benefits on e.g. health insurance, car insurance, energy and petrol. Every day United Consumers calculates the average national recommended price for one litre of different kinds of petrol. They calculate this on the basis of the suggested retail prices from the five biggest oil concerns in the Netherlands; Shell, BP, Total, Texaco and Esso.   What about the price? Recommended & averageIn the article from De Telegraaf it’s written that the national recommended price for one litre of Euro 95 was €1,83 at that moment. Although, the national recommended price is not the same as the average price for petrol. The national recommended price is an indication of the petrol price in a country, petrol stations are free to adjust the price. The Statistics Bureau of the Netherlands (CBS) provides current and reliable statistical information of the average petrol prices in the Netherlands.  On January 7 the average petrol price for a litre of Euro 95 was, according to, CBS €1,717. In the weekly oil bulletin from the European Commission the average price for one litre of Euro 95 in the Netherlands was €1,716. Buckle up!But is that the highest price in Europe? In the weekly oil bulletin, all the average prices for one litre of Euro 95 in EU member states are available. And yes, the Netherlands is the most expensive country for petrol in the European Union. Second up is Denmark with an average of €1,67 and on the bottom of the list is Romania with €1,09.    IMAGE: this map shows consumer prices of Euro 95 in Europe on 6 January 2020 and is available for download here. However, De Telegraaf is talking about Europe. When researching the petrol prices all over Europe, the best way to compare prices is to use the national recommended price from each country. This is the price that United Consumers used as well. The Royal Dutch Touring Club (ANWB) has made a list of the national recommended prices in Europe for one litre of Euro 95. In their list the price is €1,82 – one cent less than United Consumers, but even so the Netherlands has the highest price on the list.

According to the French Maritime Prefecture of the English Channel and the North Sea, a total of 31 people were brought ashore. The Russian media write that on the morning of October 4th, the maritime prefecture received a warning from the Regional Operational Monitoring and Rescue Center (CROSS) that boats with 13 and 18 migrants on board were in distress north of the city of Calais. It was also clarified that the passengers themselves asked for help. On board of the first boat were 11 men, one woman and one teenager, and on board of the second – 14 adults and four children. According to preliminary data, several people were brought ashore with hypothermia. The Coast Guard officers who arrived at the scene provided first aid to the victims, after that the refugees were taken to the Dunkirk and Gravlin cities. In order to factcheck this information, we visited the official website of the English Channel Prefecture and the North Sea and in the section called «Actualités» we found the tab «Communiqués de presse» (press releases). In the October news, there is a statement called «Sauvetage de deux embarcations de migrants au large de Calais» (Salvation of two boats with migrants off the coast of Calais), in which the procedure for rescuing migrants is written by the hour and the conclusion is made that «they are all safe and sound due to the efficiency and responsiveness of the subjects operating daily at sea to protect human lives: the marine prefecture and its CROSS GRATIS maritime operations center, Dauphin helicopter, French Navy, as well as SNSM Dunkirk and Gravlin crews».

149;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-because-of-climate-change-half-of-european-will-be-allergic-to-pollen/;“Because of climate change half of Europeans will be allergic to pollen”;2020-01-12;eufactcheck;;A Croatian political platform called ‘We can!’ held a round table in December 2019 called “Are we all in the same boat?”. The main topic was climate change and its consequences. One of the guests was Mrs Dunja Mazzocco Drvar, meteorologist at the Croatian commercial TV channel RTL, interviewed by a Croatian online news outlet Tportal after the event. In an attempt to emphasize the problem, she stated that by year 2030 half of Europeans would be allergic to pollen as a consequence of climate changes. In this article we check if this estimation is correct, but also the presumed correlation between climate change and increasing number of pollen allergies.  Mrs Dunja Mazzocco Drvar can be considered an expert in this field. She is a broadcast meteorologist for more than 15 years, with a degree in physics of atmosphere and sea at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Zagreb. Over the years she’s been working at Hydrometeorological Institute of Croatia as a meteorologist and she’s a published academic author. Also, she was awarded with the TV Weather Forecast Award 2018 by the European Meteorological Society. We contacted Mrs Mazzocco Drvar and asked for relevant publications that support her claim. She referred us to the advocacy manifesto of ‘The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology’ (EAACI), an association with more than 11,000 members from 124 countries and over 50 National Allergy Societies, described on the website as “the primary source of expertise in Europe for all aspects of allergy.“ In the foreword of the manifesto, it is stated that “Today, more than 150 million Europeans suffer from chronic allergic diseases and the current prediction is that by 2025 half of the entire EU population will be affected.“ First of all, while Mrs Mazzocco Drvar stated that by 2030 more than half of Europeans will suffer from chronic allergic diseases, EAACI’s manifesto says that this will happen by 2025. Also, the manifesto refers to the EU population, while Europeans are a wider category and include non-EU countries as well. Furthermore, this information in the manifesto is not presented as research finding, but an estimation that is not further supported by any relevant scientific studies that may lead to this conclusion. However, EAACI’s estimation has been quoted by charities, research foundations and EP interest groups. Also, in the manifesto it is stated that “in recent years EAACI has led major public awareness campaigns on allergy, developed a series of public declarations on specific advocacy topics (e.g. Immunotherapy, Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis) and organised dedicated policy events in the European Parliament“. Therefore, the association and its estimations are considered relevant and trustworthy in the profession, even though it remains unclear in what way this estimation was developed. According to meteorologist Dunja Mazzocco Drvar, this manifesto is a relevant source. Second, the correlation made by Mrs Mazzocco Drvar between allergies, especially pollen allergies, and climate change, is supported by scientific findings. Dittlein and others and Gilles-Stein and others explain in their studies (both from 2016) that the cause of allergic reactions to pollen grains are not exclusively protein allergens, which are often considered the main culprits for the formation allergy. Pollen allergies are also caused by biochemical cells that are a part of pollen. According to the study of Beckova and others from 2013, these structures are affected by climate changes and can  intensify pollen allergies. As the abstract states, “Evidence is compelling for a positive correlation between climate change, urbanisation and prevalence of allergic sensitisation and diseases. The reason for this association is not clear to date”. Furthermore, Sofiev and others confirmed that there is a correlation between the increasing number of pollens in the air and the processes of urbanization, industrialization, environmental pollution and climate change. Damialis and Sofiev and their colleagues state that big amounts of exhaust gases raise the level of air pollution, which leads to more people suffering from allergies, especially in urban areas. The mentioned studies estimate that there will be more seasons of pollen and that they will last longer. Also, polluted cells of pollen irritate the mucous membranes of the lungs and make people less resistant to it. According to the estimation by Lake and others, until 2060 the amount of different pollen allergies in Europe will probably double. Therefore, while the year that Mrs Dunja Mazzocco Drvar mentioned is not correct, it is still close. Also, the information about half of the EU population being allergic by year 2025 is not supported by scientific findings in EAACI’s manifesto, however we assessed this association as relevant and trustworthy source in the field, along with its estimations. The second part of the statement that makes a correlation between allergies and climate change is also supported by scientific studies mentioned above. In conclusion, we assess that this statement is mostly true.

The story was part of a special broadcast on child maltreatment in The Netherlands. Is the number correct and in the right context? The Instagram story and broadcast do not mention the source of the number of maltreated children in The Netherlands. The context of child maltreatment The Dutch police writes that child maltreatment eg. abuse is every form of threatening or violent interactions of a physical, psychological or sexual nature that causes or threatens to cause serious harm to a minor, like a physical or psychological injury.  According to the European Status Report on Preventing Child Maltreament (2018, World Health Organisation – WHO) child maltreatment affects over 55 million children in the WHO European region and is a social problem that exists in all countries. Furthermore, child abuse is a leading cause of health inequality and social injustice.  To counter the inequality a 2014 action plan has been set up by the WHO’s regional office for Europe in which the goal is to “…reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment by implementing preventive programmes that address risk and protective factors, including social determinants” and the target to “reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment and child homicide rates by 20% by 2020”.  Just last week the 60-country benchmarking index Out of the Shadows: Shining Light on the Response to Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation was released by The Economist Intelligence Unit. This index focuses, like many other studies, on only one segment of child maltreatment: sexual abuse. It is noteworthy that The Netherlands are not part of these 60 countries as the total size of the child population is low. All efforts are part of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development that world leaders agreed to in 2015.  The numbers on child maltreatment The Dutch Youth Institute (Nederlands Jeugdinstituut – NJI), an established independent knowledge and research centre on children’s well being, publishes statistics based on two national annual research reports and a number of academic publications. The latest statistics are derived from the National Prevalence Study of Abuse (Nationale Prevalentiestudie Mishandeling) and the School Research into Child Abuse (Scholierenonderzoek Kindermishandeling) in 2017.  The Institute concludes that in 2017 an estimated 90.000 to 127.000 children between 0 and 18 years have been exposed to some form of child maltreatment. This amounts to about 3% of all Dutch children. However, this includes children where professionals have reported abuse. Since not all cases of child abuse are identified, 3% is the lower limit.  Compared with previous studies from The Netherlands, in 2005 and 2010, there are no significant differences in the number of children who have to deal with one or more forms of child abuse. The research also shows that 96% of the children are mistreated by the biological parent.  The majority of cases involve emotional neglect, followed by physical neglect. Sexual abuse is the least reported.  Roos Kooijman, health scientist at the Institute, spoke to EUFACTCHECK and explains their use of the range of 90.000 up to 127.000 instead of a fixed number. “We do so because it is an estimate, we do not know how many children are abused every year. Our numbers are based on previous studies and experts in national prevention who make the estimate.” The Dutch police uses the exact figure of 119.000 cases of maltreatment on their webpage about child abuse, this is the confirmed number of cases the police force dealt with. The page furthermore states: “In reality, the number of child abuse cases is probably much higher”. CONCLUSION The claim made in the Instagram story speaks of 119.000 children – it doesn’t provide any context that explains which sorts of abuse they counted and why it fails to mention the range of 90.000 up to 127.000. However, the difference is that the Dutch Youth Institute makes an estimate based on studies and expert experiences while the police uses confirmed cases. Therefore the claim is true.

151;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-carbon-emission-will-lower-with-85-with-saf/;“Carbon emission will lower with 85% with SAF”;2019-12-20;eufactcheck;;On Twitter Royal Dutch Shell on November 18th 2019, announced that they will support SkyNRG, a supplier and distributor of sustainable aviation fuel, in assisting them to develop Europe’s first sustainable aviation fuel production plant through the Board Now program. In both the Tweet and the accompanying press release Shell states that concerning the lower carbon emission of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF from now on), compared to conventional jet fuels, the carbon emission will lower with approximately 85%. This 85% estimation is, claims Shell in the press release, from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB).   CLAIMIs Shell correct by claiming that the RSB estimates that carbon emission will lower with 85% when SAF is used instead of conventional jet fuels?  First of all, what is SkyNRG? SkyNRG is, according to their ‘about us’ page, a global market leader for sustainable aviation fuel solutions. It’s mission is to make SAF the new global standard. They “source, blend and distribute” SAF and currently supply more than 30 airlines. SkyNRG leads the first European production plant that will be placed in Delfzijl, Netherlands. They will mostly help with the technical and commercial side of the plant. To make sure SkyNrG is making the right decisions they are advised by a few international networks and foundations. SkyNRG operations are certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), as stated in the Shell press release. The Dutch KLM has established for a period of 10 years to the development and purchase of 75,000 tonnes of SAF per year. KLM is the first airline in the world to widely invest in sustainable aviation fuel. Secondly, what is the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials? RSB is a, according to their website, global, multi-stakeholder independent organization that drives the development of a new world ‘bioeconomy’, they help supply chain companies achieve RSB certification for their bio-based fuels.  Conventional jet fuels vs. SAF The difference between conventional jet fuels and SAF lies in the source of the carbon, SAF recycles CO2 emissions emitted previously for example used cooking oil. The conventional jet fuels still need to get burnt to get the energy out of the emission. The SAF does not contain sulphur and is low in fine particle, in fact SAF is recycled Co2 carbon. In this KLM webinar from 16 December 2019, Maarten van Dijk, Managing Director of SkyNRG together with Jurriaan de Jonge, Fuel Director of KLM, explain what SAF is. According to SkyNRG’s Van Dijk, in the webinar, even with the same burning emission, there is a difference in the overall emission. That overall emission lies in the full lifecycle and complete chain of the SAF production.  The Board Now program The Board Now program is, according to their website, a coalition of forward thinking companies that tries to reduce their carbon footprint. Together they try to support the growth of the SAF industry. The first project of the Board Now program is the first European SAF Supply Line which will be placed in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. The Board Now program is powered by SkyNRG, the company that is responsible for the first European SAF supply Line. So how about the 85% claim? In order to find out if the statement made by the article from shell is true or not we must trace back to the primary source of the statement. In this case that source is the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). After some research on the website of the RSB it seems the organisation makes a different statement there than in the article for the press. On their website the RSB claims that their certified sustainable alternative aviation fuel has a minimum of 50% emission reduction. All SAF producers have together agreed that a new business should always provide at least 50% CO2 reduction. According to Karlijn Arts, the Policy & Sustainability Manager of the Board Now program and SkyNRG, they can reach between 80% and 90% Co2 reduction.  In an interview with Arts, she clarifies that the Co2 reduction takes places especially at the beginning of the production line. The SAF production plant namely uses residues making SAF, for example they use used cooking oil to create sustainable kerosene. According to Arts that is the obvious difference between regular kerosene production and the production of SAF.  In producing SAF substances are existing, mining is not required, so before processing there is almost no emission as well as will be in production of regular aviation fuel. Arts indicates that the different way of production together with sustainable distribution and green hydrogen will create a 85% reduction.  Unfortunately SkyNRG is not willing to share the exact numbers of the reduction comparing to conventional fuel production, because of that it is hard to find out what calculations are made and if their correct. In conclusion Shell had to elaborate on their statement on Twitter, explaining the 85% reduction is won in the production line. The statement they make in the tweet makes it seem that the SAF will cause the reduction, however, it is the change in the production line. We therefore state the claim is mostly true.

She claims that in response to an open letter in Flemish newspaper ‘De Standaard’ from journalist Nick Meynen, in which he asks her not to let the Flemish people suffocate. Although the Flemish air quality does not meet European standards, minister Demir’s statement is correct. In a report of the VMM, the Flemish Environment Agency, Demir’s statement is confirmed. The report discusses the emissions from 2000 to 2016 and the air quality in 2017. It states that the air quality was better in 2017 than it was ten years ago. There has been a distinct reduction in particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and heavy metals. Still need for improvement Despite this, according to the VMM report, Flanders still does not meet the European annual limit value for nitrogen dioxide and exceeds the European targets for ozone, sulphur dioxide and arsenic 2. The source of emissions lies mainly in agriculture and transport.  Vegetation is very much affected by air pollution. In order to maintain biodiversity, Flanders still needs to make a major improvement. It is also shown that part of the population suffers from physical complaints as a result of air pollution, and sometimes even dies prematurely as a result. This also affects Flanders economically, medical costs are rising and productivity is decreasing due to work disability.  In short, we can conclude that Flanders is on the right track, but needs to take further action for health reasons. Even for substances that comply with the European legislation. Having said that, minister Demir’s claim is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

This allegation is correct. In a press release Dagmar Belakowitch, Freedom Party delegate to the Austrian parliament, was quoted: „According to the latest media reports, the Iraqi Defence Minister faked the Swedish citizenship and social benefits under a false name as a so-called „refugee“. Hubert Erhart, press officer of the Freedom Party (FPÖ), told us that the party delegate had taken her information from an article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, published on November 26th, 2019. In fact, the Iraqi Defence Minister, Najah al-Shammari, who had only taken his office in June of this year, had arrived in Sweden under the false name Najah al-Adel in 2009 and had later taken on the Swedish citizenship on September s8th, 2015. The Swedish Migration Board confirmed this information upon request.  False additional claim Although the claim is correct, Dagmar Belakowitsch made an additional claim in the same statement: She claimed that in the city of Vienna someone like Al Shammari would have „certainly received municipality housing and subsidies for all his children“. This claim turned out to be false and nothing more than a general suspicion against the City of Vienna. Anyone staying illegally in Vienna would not be able to obtain a communal apartment or subsidies. Furthermore, there are no official figures on people staying illegally in Vienna. „If we knew this, they wouldn’t be here illegally“, they spokeswoman said.

The false AfD-claim refers to an article on the web portal of the German newscast Tagesschau.  The AfD quoted Tagesschau wrongly: while the Tagesschau reported that every third immigrant and asylum seeker had arrived in Italy via the eastern route according to UNHCR , the refugee agency of the United Nations, it did not claim that every third had arrived on a yacht. Although the Tagesschau-article addresses the issue that refugees would indeed arrive on yachts, it did not provide data on the amount of arrivals on yachts. The reason: the data is not gathered by any organization as our research shows.  AfD-Facebook-posting, August  9th, 2019: “Now they arrive on a yacht!” The UNHCR defines the eastern oversea route by boats departing from Greece and Turkey and arriving in Italy (mostly in the states Apulia, Calabria and Basilicata). Almost one third took this route in the first seven months of 2019. Therefore, the quote by Tagesschau is true, which this factsheet by UNHCR proves. To be precise: exactly 31.39 percent of all overseas arrivals used this route. If the AfD-claim would be true, all of them would have had to use yachts. It is however true that yachts are used by smugglers for overseas transport. Yet, a speaker of UNHCR stresses that this phenomenon is not new. Although the journey would be less dangerous than on rubber dinghies, it is still “often desperate and dangerous” and not “rather comfortably” as the AfD post also states.  Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, could not provide us with data on the types of boats arriving as many of them are not even tracked. Although Frontex categorizes arrivals by boat types (like motor and sailing boats), they do not have an extra category for yachts. In short, the AfD-claim is false. The AfD did not react to our query asking about their source as of November 22th, 2019.;https://www.facebook.com/alternativefuerde/posts/2571105599586430,https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/italien-apulien-schlepper-101.html,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/70741,https://www.instagram.com/;Every 3rd refugee reaches Italy on a yacht on the eastern route;;;;;;
155;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-croatian-president-claims-she-was-born-behind-the-iron-curtain/;Croatian President claims she was born behind the Iron Curtain.;2019-11-25;eufactcheck;;During the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Award speech, President Kolinda Grabar Kitarović stated that she was born on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. This statement provoked numerousreactions from the media and a storm of reactions on social networks.Kitarović was born in Croatia, which was part of Yugoslavia until 1991. Althoughcommunist-run, Yugoslavia was independent from Eastern Bloc countries. In thatcontext, the statement was false.    Croatian president Kolinda Grabar Kitarović was presented with the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Award on 26th of October 2019 in Arlington, Virginia. It is annual award given by the Fulbright Alumni Association to honour distinguished Fulbright Alumni. Being  Kolinda Fulbright Alumni in 2002-2003 this year Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was awarded for her achievements as a leader, diplomate and public servant.  The headlines in the Croatian media very much focused on one issue. In her speech, Grabar-Kitarovic reminisced about being a girl born on “the wrong side of the Iron Curtain” who used to dream about other places in which people enjoyed freedom of choice and could freely express their opinions.  This statement sparkled a debate in the media and the public arena if Croatian President Kolinda Grabar Kitarović was really born and lived behind the Iron Curtain, knowing the fact that Croatia at the time was part of Yugoslavia. As it happens very often, the interpretation of historical facts came into focus of the general public. In order to understand the context it is important to state a few historic facts.  1.The mention of the term “Iron Curtain” was made by Winston Churchill in 1946. It was on occasion when Winston Churchill, then already ex British prime minister, in the American town of Fulton, Missouri, gave a speech and used the descriptive phrase “from Stettin in the Baltic, to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.”  2. After the Second World War, Croatia was one of the republics of  the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, a country ruled by the communist party and a strong leader Josip Broz Tito  3. Tito died in 1980, but the system remained in place until Croatia gained independence in 1991.  4. There is also the fact that Yugoslavia’s communist leader Josip Broz Tito had a split with Stalin in 1948, and broke all ties with the Soviet Union and the Soviet Bloc countries  So the fact that Yugoslavia was on the other side of Iron Curtain was valid only for two years. The best known Croatian Cold war expert and the author of the book „The Third Side of the Cold war“ Tvrko Jakovina, refers to Churchill’s statement on the Iron Curtain and says that, regarding Yugoslavia, it was a true statement only until 1948. At the time of the Churchill speech,  the Iron Curtain not only included cities like Belgrade, Budapest, Prague, but also Vienna and Berlin that were jointly occupied by the French, British, American, and Soviet forces.  In 1948, something happened that shook the world. It was the Tito – Stalin split. The Yugoslav president, Josip Broz Tito, despite being a communist formerly loyal to Moscow, split with Soviet leader Stalin in 1948, two years after Churchill’s speech. According to historian Tvrtko Jakovina, the split was one of the most important events of the early phase of the Cold War.It was recognized by the Americans as a chance to move Soviets further away from the Adriatic Sea and Italy, to move the „iron curtain“ to the borders of Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe. Although Yugoslavia remained a one-party system with a Commnist Party rule, it was not allied to the Soviet Union and was also not a part of collective defence treaty – The Warsaw Block.  The West supported Yugoslavia because it was meant to be a kind of an example to the others which were strongly tied to the Soviets. According to historians, this was the main reason why Yugoslavia remained outside the Iron Curtain until the end of the Cold War. By 1949, Truman’s administration was lending millions of dollars to Yugoslavia, Truman was sending food packages to Yugoslavia. American General Omar Bradley, called Yugoslavia „American communist ally“. China’s leader Mao Zedong was criticizing Yugoslavia for not being  communist enough.  One of the proofs of this is also the fact that in 1953, and then in 1954, Yugoslavia and two NATO members Greece and Turkey, signed the Balkan Pact, a  political and then a military treaty. The aim was to act against Soviet expansion in the Balkans. In all the geopolitical maps, Yugoslavia although communist-run, was (see the map) drawn outside of the Iron Curtain area.      https://www.nato.int/cps/us/natohq/declassified_138294.htm    The term Iron Curtain remained as defining a border between Soviet Union (Eastern Europe) and the western world that sustained itself until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. The border was heavily guarded by the Soviets to prevent foreign influence that would disrupt their communist rule and to disable its residents from escaping Soviet territory. The fact that Croatia was part of Yugoslavia at the time, Yugoslavia wasn’t a part of the „Eastern bloc“, therefore was not behind the Iron Curtain.  The Iron Curtain was very often identified with Berlin Wall, but it is not exactly true. The Berlin Wall was built 1961. And it fell some months after the first “part” of the Iron Curtain fell on the Hungarian-Austrian border when the foreign ministers of Hungary and Austria had symbolically snipped the border fence, the physical “Iron Curtain” between the West and the communist bloc controlled by the Soviet Union.  Presenting it to the public as a national pride and a wish to create a third way in a the polarising world between the West and East, Tito’s rebellion caused a lot of tensions between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Overall, the polarisation that later turned to Cold War started discussions among other countries about the peaceful coexistence between the two forces. The discussions led to the setting up of the Non-alignment movement. The idea was realised in 1956, when Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlah Nehru and Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Naser met with Tito on the Brijuni islands to talk about the very foundations of the movement, the conclusion of which was the signing of Brijuni Declaration.  Five years later, in 1961, the first conference of the Non-alignment movement was held in Belgrade with Tito having a lead role. As this third bloc became more powerful, both Eastern and Western blocs started to acknowledge it, which lead to Tito having meetings with various statesmen across the world.  The difference between Yugoslavia and the countries behind Iron Curtain were, among other things, their travel rights. Yugoslav residents regularly travelled abroad, mostly to Italy or Austria to buy things that couldn’t be obtained in Yugoslavia and many people also left Yugoslavia to work in West Germany after an agreement was signed between Yugoslavia and Germany in 1968. The red Yugoslav passport allowed traveling across the world including to the Soviet Union, as the two countries started having better diplomatic relationships after Stalin’s death (1953).  During the Cold War period, from the establishment of the European Economic Community (later expanded into the European Union) in 1957 until the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Yugoslavia was the only socialist state which developed close relations with the organisation, but never became a full member.  At the same time, Yugoslavia joined many organisations established by the western countries. As an example, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a member of European Broadcasting Union. As such, Yugoslavia was the only communist country that participated in the Eurovision Song Contest, joined in 1961. and participated 26 times.  Kolinda Grabar Kitarović’s statement that she was born on the other side of Iron Curtain caused a lot of controversies in Croatian public arena. However the story culminated with the president facing the inaccuracy of her statement saying that she was only referring to Churchill’s speech.  As Churchill’s speech dates from 1946, but Kolinda Grabar Kitarović was born in 1968, there is no way that she could have ever lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain. And her talk about dreaming about going to the places where “people were able to speak freely” was also not true, because, not only could she could travel freely, but she herself was able to go to the United States in 1980s on a high school exchange programme.  In the context of everything that was said, Kolinda Grabar Kitarović’s statement that she was born and lived behind the Iron Curtain can be nothing but false.  It is worth to mention that President Kolinda Grabar Kitarović has a Master’s Degree in international relations from the Faculty of Political Science, University of Zagreb, so it is doubtful that she is not aware of the historical fact because her Faculty mentor prof. Radovan Vukadinović is an expert in the field. Or she might be aware of the fact, but spreads disinformation anyway because it just – sounds better.  In the era of political populism it has become very common to cover up and distort history in order to influence politics.  The presidential elections in Croatia will be held on 22th December and Kolinda Grabar Kitarović is running for a second mandate.

Von der Leyen tweeted this on November 4th and promised to close this gap. The claim turns out to be true.  The 4th November of 2019 is Equal Pay Day. In honour of Equal Pay Day, EC president-elect von der Leyen tweeted this statement: “Today on #EqualPayDay women earn on average 16% less than men. Written in the European Treaties 60 years ago, equal pay for equal work is still not a reality. That’s why I will table measures to introduce binding pay transparency measures. We must give women and men equal rights!” According to the European statistics website Eurostat this claim is indeed true. The Belgian statistics website Statbel confirms the 16% too. The numbers are based on data from 2017. Eurostat claims that the gender pay gap is much lower for young employees. The countries where the pay gap is the highest are Estonia, Czech Republic and Germany, all between 21% and 25%. Belgium, France and Romania are the only EU countries where women under the age of 25 years old are payed more than men.  In short: Based upon stats of Eurostat, Ursula von der Leyen’s claim that women earn less than men is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

It quoted the Flemish minister-president Jan Jambon (N-VA) who stated that Brexit already brought 42 companies and 2,000 jobs to Flanders, Belgium. Where did they get that specific number? Jambon made that comment in the Flemish Parliament earlier that day in approach to Brexit. Earlier numbers showed that Brexit would only be negative for European companies, but Jambon stated the opposite. His statement is confirmed by Sarah Heuninck from the cabinet of Jan Jambon himself. “The figures are real and are investigated by Flanders Investment & Trade.” FIT is an organization that facilitates investments in Flanders. They did numerous researches on Brexit subjects and investigated the influence in different companies. That’s what the cabinet told us. They couldn’t give us the figures themselves. Confidential information The company that did the investigation, Flanders Investment & Trade also didn’t want to give us the exact information from which Jambon gets his facts. “The information is strictly confidential and is not permitted to be published.” They did give us a document that said that a lot of companies invested in Belgium, but there was nothing about actual jobs. The reason why it’s confidential is that a lot of the numbers are internal information from the companies themselves, and often even speculations and hypotheses.  Exact opposite The fact that Jambon stated this in Parliament while hundreds of other politicians and experts say the exact opposite makes the claim conspicuous. Only one day before, another article in the Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad (pay wall) published that Brexit could cost the Flemish ten thousands of jobs. That’s what most newspapers say.  So, a lot of hypotheses claim that Brexit could only be harmful for jobs in Flanders, and it would be a great move of Jambon to show the citizens of Flanders wrong. Which is not possible if the sources he uses aren’t available. Conclusion This fact is uncheckable. Jambon’s statement is correct according to his own cabinet but can’t be checked by a third party. We, for example, couldn’t see the figures ourselves, and can’t say it’s true because the figures have not been confirmed by another source.

It says that Queen Elizabeth II  has approved the document that postpones the country’s exit from the European Union if there is no agreement with Brussels by October 31, 2019, which allows to go on with Brexit and leaving EU. This was announced by Speaker of the House of Lords Peter Fowler. The Russian media say that Queen Elizabeth II approved the bill which requires head of the government Boris Johnson to ask Brussels to postpone Brexit if there is no agreement with EU. On Monday, September, 9, a House of Lords speaker Peter Fowler read a list of bills approved by Queen Elizabeth II. In order to factcheck this information we visited the official UK parliament website, then found «Parliamentary business» page and went on to «News» page. There is «European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill proceeds to Royal Assent» article dated September 2019 which states that both houses agreed to the final edition and on Monday, September, 9 the bill went into Royal Assent stage which turns a bill into a law.

The political debates died down, the EU elections are all over. However, we consider the rumours to be false. Why would EUfactcheck continue to exist when there are no more election campaigns? That’s the argument behind the gossip and half-truths that could be heard through the grapevine. We talked to the coordinator of the international fact-checking project, Nadia Vissers of Artesis Plantijn in Antwerp, Belgium. She is very strict in her conclusion: “Of course, we’re going to continue. We still have to decide  which form exactly the project will take in the future, with some participants dropping out while new partners might join in. But you’d better keep an eye on us.” Enthousiastic students and lecturers Also the current participating Journalism schools show enthusiasm to go on. Elvira van Noort, Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, looks back in satisfaction: “Our students analysed some serious political claims very thoroughly and this resulted in great and interesting stories.” Similar testimonials can be heard in Finland: “The project’s international dimension gives it an extra attraction”, according to Anne Leppäjärvi from Haaga Helia Helsinki. “Each region has its own way of practicing journalism. It’s not only very interesting to observe the differences and similarities, it’s also fascinating to set this to work.” Conclusion: because of the above-mentioned plans and intentions, we consider the rumours that EUfactcheck would stop, false.

160;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-upcoming-eu-elections-are-a-referendum-on-abortion/;The upcoming EU elections are “a referendum on abortion”;2019-05-27;eufactcheck;;"On the 12th of May 2019, Maltese leader of the Nationalist Party, Adrian Delia, stated in Times of Malta that the upcoming European elections are “a referendum on abortion.” He continues that every seat going to the Labour Party would be a seat in the European Parliament in favour of abortion. Malta is the only country in the European Union where abortion is not allowed under all circumstances.  For the small Mediterranean island between Europe and Africa with its overall catholic society, abortion is an unspoken topic. Moreover, in case of an abortion either the medical performer or the consenting person could risk jail time up to four years. Manifesto of Party of European Socialists In his statement, Delia says that a seat for the Labour Party is one in favour of abortion. And there is a reason why he makes this connection.  In the Maltese parliament, the Labour Party (red) has the majority of the seats. Other parties are the Nationalistic Party (blue) and the Democratic Party (yellow). Visual © United Union – Wikimedia Commons The Labour Party, Malta’s largest party in the government, is part of the political group Party of European Socialists (PES) in the European Parliament. They’ve published a manifesto in the beginning of March 2019 for the forthcoming EU elections. It is written in there that they aim to “ensure that every individual has access to their full sexual and reproductive rights” and that “every person has the right to decide over their own body”.  Sexual and reproductive rights (SRR) entitles the right to make your own decision on sexual and reproductive health. One of the things that it includes it to determine the number, timing and spacing of their children. Sexual and reproductive health is on one side the capability to have a “safe and satisfying sex life” and on the other side “the ability to reproduce”. Source: European Humanist Federation  A bit controversial for the Maltese member party. The Labour party does claim they’ll maintain their party line with regards to these SRR and Maltese MEP of the Labour Party Alfred Sant also said that “abortion is in no way part of the programme of Malta’s Labour government”. It looks like that the views of the PES are different from its Maltese member party. Therefore, it does not directly mean that every seat for the Labour Party is one in favour of abortion. There is, however, more to this story that it first seems. Malta as part of the EU In May 2004, Malta became an EU member state, in response to a referendum held in March 2003. Malta’s two major parties, the Labour and Nationalistic Party had different views on Malta’s accession. While the Nationalistic Party wanted to become an EU member state, the Labour Party only wanted to establish a partnership with the EU.  Referendum Malta for accession into the EU Infogram With a turnout of 91%, a small majority of the Maltese people agreed that Malta should become an EU member state. The numbers have been rounded up. Graph © Suzanna Demey Labour leader Alfred Sant was, however, not convinced with this small majority. He wanted to make the upcoming general election the definite decider. His party’s ultimate loss in these elections led the way for Malta to the EU. One of the condition for Malta to join the Union was that the EU would never be able to force the legalisation of abortion upon Malta. Therefore, the statement made by Delia is incorrect. Terminology At last, Delia uses the word ‘referendum’. To know what a referendum and election actually entails, we looked up their definition in the Cambridge Dictionary. A referendum is a vote in which all the people in a country or an area are asked to give their opinion about or decide an important political or social question. An election is a time when people vote in order to choose someone for a political or official job. In short, the similarity in these two terms is that people are being asked to cast a vote, but while a referendum is to decide something, an election is to choose someone. In this case to represent Malta in the European Parliament. Therefore, the word “referendum” shouldn’t be used in this context. Conclusion Although the Labour Party is part of a European group who strives for full SRR, abortion in Malta can never be decided by the EU. Moreover, the EU elections are not a referendum.

On March 2017 the University of Amsterdam published a report in which ‘flexible labour market’ is given an understandable definition: ‘’Flexible work includes all types of (paid) work that are not carried out in a permanent employment with a fixed working hours’’. The Netherlands vs Europe Even though the earlier named report gives a clear definition, there is still a difference between the Netherlands and other European countries. On 25 April 2019 the Central Bureau for the Statics (CBS), published their research about the flexible labour market in the Netherlands and Europe. This shows that the definition of a flexible labour market in the Netherlands may differ with the definition in other European countries: ‘’The difference is that the EU only looks at the contract. In the Netherlands both the contract and the contract hours are important.’’ This is why the EU-number in the Netherlands is lower than the CBS-number in the figures below. In the Eurostat figures for 2015 the Netherlands is ranked sixth. Flex workers in the EU. Source: CBS, 2017 By using the Dutch definition, the CBS comes to the conclusion that in 2017 the Netherlands were the fourth country to have the most flexible labour market. Only Poland, Spain and Greece were ranked higher. Despite being in fourth place, the Netherlands is the fastest growing country on the flexible labour market. The figure below shows that the Netherlands were between 2007 and 2017 the fastest growing country and that Poland and Spain even sank on the flexible labour market.  Growth in amount of flex workers in the EU. Source: CBS, 2017 Most flexible or not? Following the research from the CBS, The Netherlands does not have the most flexible labour market in Europe, but the country is the fastest grower. The European countries with a bigger flexible labour market are even dropping on the flexible labour market index, whereby the Netherlands is likely to have the most flexible labour market in the future, provided that such growth persists. Conclusion Based on the most recent figures from the CBS, however, the claim by Agnes Jongerius: “The Netherlands has the most flexible labour market in Europe” is false.

162;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-cost-of-irish-reunification-2-7-billion-pounds/;The cost of Irish reunification – £2.7 billion pounds?;2019-05-24;eufactcheck;;"With Brexit raising tensions ever higher in the British political landscape, talks of reuniting Ireland and Northern Ireland have surfaced again. In a 2016 document titled ‘Towards a United Ireland’, Irish political party Sinn Fein outlined how the reunification of Ireland and Northern Ireland might not be as costly as is popularly believed. Outlining the cost at a total of £2.7 billion instead of the traditionally believed £24.1 billion. But how accurate is this?  Firstly, we will look at any direct costs associated with Northern Ireland. Because of its relatively weak economy Northern Ireland is dependent on the British treasury to sustain it. With 28.2 percent of the population economically inactive, and a lack of foreign investments the region runs a fiscal deficit. Ireland would have to pay out of pocket to even out its spending. Currently, Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom receives £10.8 billion (€12.1 billion) in annual subvention from the UK exchequer, which equates to 25 percent of its national income. Figures published by Ulster University’s Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) show how subvention rose from the period of 1966-1993. Subvention was first recorded as costing £52 million annually (£489 million in 1992 prices), rising to £3.34 billion by 1996-97 and up to its current amount of £10.8 billion in 2018. These are the direct costs associated with Northern Ireland as a region. Secondly it is worth taking a quick look at the possible impact of a hard Brexit on Northern Ireland’s economy. Northern Ireland has a considerably closer economic relationship with the EU, and particularly Ireland, compared with any other part of the UK. While less than 50 percent of UK merchandise exports are destined for the EU, about 56 percent of Northern Ireland’s exports are to the EU, and of that more than half go to Ireland. A report led by academics at the University of British Columbia found that a hard Brexit would reduce Northern Ireland’s GDP by €10.1bn from 2021-25. Lastly, because of the aforementioned reasons, a report by economists John Fitzgerald of Trinity College Dublin and Edgar Morgenroth of Dublin City University, suggest that the added taxes to sustain Northern Ireland in a United Ireland scenario, would result in a 15 percent drop in living standards in the Republic. The researchers point out however that what remains unsolvable is the question of what a united Ireland might be capable of economically in the long run. They point out that while it might be costly for the first 10 years, their combined economies might supersede their individual ones in 30 years. After all the kinks had been worked out. They refer to the German reunification in 1991 as a historical example of what might happen. Conclusion While there may be some truth to Sinn Fein’s claim – considering all the variables – that reunification might not be as costly for the citizens of the Republic of Ireland as normally believed, in the short term several economic studies point towards a higher initial cost than £2.7 billion. We therefore conclude that the claim is false.    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

In that article, they link pollution to sustainable thinking. Sustainable thinkers would be above-average polluters. This is what the author of this article wrongly concludes from a research of Peter Kanne, member of I&O Research. Kanne examined the sustainable thinking and doing of the Dutch. For this fact check we spoke with Peter Kanne. The following is stated in the lead of the article: “It appears that sustainable thinkers are above-average polluters. That has been shown by an inquiry by I&O Research commissioned by the Home Office.” But what is stated, is mostly false. The inquiry does not show that sustainable thinkers are the biggest polluters. According to the inquiry, high-educated people emit more CO2 then low-educated people, even though the high-educated people are more concerned about the climate. That is in fact what is stated in the article. There is a but though. You cannot conclude that sustainable thinkers emit more CO2 than non-sustainable thinkers. Kanne: “No straight correlation has been made between the way people think and how much CO2 they emit.” Kanne did examine the correlation between voting behavior and the emission of CO2 (see figure below).    CO2-emisson in points in relation to the voting behavior TK2017, source: I&O Research Certain groups who are more concerned about the climate, for example higher-educated D66-voters, fly more often and drive their car more often than the average Dutch person. That is one of the reasons why they emit more. GL-, CU-, and PvdD-voters are sustainable thinkers too, but they are found low on the list of CO2-emitters. So, certain sustainable thinkers do in fact act sustainably. “In general, we can say that most Dutch people feel like something has to change in terms of CO2-emission, but they don’t act like it”, says Kanne. CONCLUSION  The inquiry of I&O Research is not saying that the sustainability conscious Dutch are the biggest polluters. They do pollute above average, but others do not. That’s why we conclude that the RTL News article is mostly false.       Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Kathleen Van Brempt, a Belgian politician and member of the European Parliament, stated in this article that 98% of the EU’s urban population is exposed to ozone levels that exceed WHO guidelines. The numbers are correct, but are they up to date, and what are the WHO instructions?  Kathleen Van Brempt published the following statement on the website of the sp.a: “98% of the EU’s urban population is exposed to ozone levels that exceed WHO guidelines.” The statement can be found in an article about sp.a’s plan to obtain cleaner air. The article is a reaction to a motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on 6 March 2019 in which clean air in Europe is central. The resolution was voted and approved on 13 March 2019. The statement is confirmed by Antti Kaartinen, press officer of the European Environment Agency (EEA) based on the EEA’s Air Quality in Europe-2018 report. However, he explains, that these measurements and therefore also the values date from 2016. No new European data After 2016 there are no new figures available. Frans Fierens, the scientific collaborator of the Interregional Cell for the Environment (IRCEL), says that it is normal that there are no new data: “The numbers are not going to change very much year after year, so the values at European level will still be more or less the same as in 2016. In Belgium, the values have risen to over one hundred per cent in all areas, both urban as non-urban.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recommended values for ozone are 100 µg/m³, one-millionth of a gram per cubic meter of air, for the highest 8-hour average of a day. The World Health Organisation’s advisory value is stricter than the European one, which has an advisory value of 120 µg/m³, and on average may not be exceeded for more than 25 days per year over three years. This concentration should provide sufficient protection for public health, although adverse effects may already occur below this advisory value. Only the European target values are legally binding. Ozone as the only parameter “I think it’s a bit strange that they take ozone as a parameter for air pollution in the statement. For health care, particulate matter is much more important than ozone,” Frans Fierens says. “In every part of Belgium we are above the WHO’s advice standards for ozone and almost everywhere above the standards for particulate matter; only in the Ardennes, we achieve this standard for particulate matter. The reason why the figures for particulate matter were not used is unclear. Conclusion In conclusion, it is indeed correct to state that “98% of the EU’s urban population is exposed to ozone levels that exceed WHO guidelines.” Kathleen Van Brempt’s statement is correct and valid according to official reports from the EEA. The values are from 2016 but have not changed much to the present according to Frans Fierens, scientific collaborator of the Interregional Cell for the Environment (IRCEL). Also, the values on the particulate matter would probably be a better parameter to communicate in the article because they are more critical in terms of health.

The discussions about this policy for 2021 have therefore started. Following this discussion, Menno Bentveld, a reporter at the Dutch national radio station NPO Radio 1 called Bas Eickhout, MEP on behalf of GroenLinks. Eickhout claimed that 80 percent of the European agricultural money goes to the 20 percent largest farmers.  The happy farmer, © Tess Marteijn, 2019 This claim is also addressed in the GroenLinks (Dutch Green party) election program. They call it absurd that a small number of large farms receive such a large part of the European agricultural budget. GroenLinks believes that the EU should give more support to farmers who want to make their business more sustainable, who invest in animal welfare or who expand their business with farmers’ camping sites, heritage shops, care farms and other forms of rural development. In short, with the statement Bas Eickhout and GroenLinks want to show that they think the distribution of the agricultural money is unfair. EU agricultural budget The distribution of the agricultural budget is laid down in The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), established in 1957 with the foundation of the European Economic Community. The purpose of the CAP at that time was to provide Europe with its own food supply and to import as little as possible. In 2018, almost 38 percent of the European Union budget goes to agriculture. The CAP nowadays focuses on income support for farmers, market regulation and rural development. In his statement, Eickhout talks about European agricultural money. However, a large part of the European agricultural money does not go directly to the farmers. That is why we only focus on the income support that farmers receive from the EU. The European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) is responsible for this. Every farmer in the European Union receives a subsidy of 260 euros per hectare of agricultural land if he meets all environmental and sustainability requirements. If farmers do something about the biodiversity on their farm, this will be supplemented by 115 euros in greening premium per hectare. In addition, farmers under the age of 41 receive additional financial support. They receive 50 euros per hectare per year. Young farmers and big farmers A farmer under the age of 41 therefore receives 425 euros per hectare per year if he meets all EU requirements. The more land a farmer owns, the more subsidy he receives. The European Commission shows in their 2018 statistical factsheet how this income support for farmers was divided. In 2017 there were 6.5 million farmers who were entitled to agricultural money from the CAP. Together they received more than 41 billion euros. As farmers receive an amount per hectare, larger farms receive more money. The table shows that 24 percent of the farmers received more than 5000 euros. This is a total of 1.6 million farmers. These farmers together received almost 85 percent of all European agricultural subsidy. In the statistical factsheet there is no precise percentage for 80% of the subsidy. However it does give a number for 74.4 percent. This goes to 14.6% of all farmers receiving European agricultural support.    Conclusion When we level between 84,7 and 74,4 percent, we can conclude that 20% of the farmers receive approximately 80 percent of the agricultural support money. Assuming that Bas Eickhout refers to income support for farmers, when talking about agricultural support, we can regard his statement as true.

166;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-every-fourth-employee-in-germany-is-in-the-low-wage-sector/;Every fourth employee in Germany is in the low-wage sector;2019-05-23;eufactcheck;;German politician Sahra Wagenknecht (The Left) has criticized the reform of the German labour market by former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, called “Agenda 2010”. She makes this reform responsible for one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe. Some of her numbers are correct but not all of them. During the campaign for the European elections, Sahra Wagenknecht spoke in Düsseldorf on May 7th about the low wages in Germany: “What were the Agenda 2010 labour market reforms that led to one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe emerging in Germany? (…) One in four today works in the low-wage sector, and in the case of young people even one in three, and most of them only in temporary jobs.“ Her speech can be found on Youtube. At the beginning of her statement, she criticised the labour market reforms, which have led to the emergence of one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe in Germany according to her point of view. In the low-wage sector, workers are paid well below the average wage level of the labour market – less than two thirds of the median wage, to be exact.  Unemployment rate has fallen  The basic building blocks of Agenda 2010 related to the labour market. The so-called Harz IV reforms were an important part of this. Here, the criteria for reasonable work were tightened, thus more jobs were available which had to be carried out by the unemployed. If jobs were not accepted, sanctions threatened. In addition, the duration of unemployment benefits for unemployed persons aged 55 and over was reduced from 32 to 18 months and for those under 55 to 12 months.  In her statement, Sahra Wagenknecht refers only to this aspect and ignores the positive effects of the Agenda 2010 reform. In 2010, the unemployment rate was 3.2 million and fell to 2.3 million people in Germany by 2018 according to official statistics.  Many earn low wages A study by the Hans Böckler Foundation from 2012 confirms Wagenknecht‘s statement that Germany is one of the largest low-wage sectors in Europe. In 2015, every fourth employee in Germany continued to work in this sector and earned less than 10.22 euros per hour according to newer statistics of the Foundation. Thus the statement that every fourth person today works in the low-income sector is true. A further study by the Hans Böckler Foundation also confirms that every third person under 35 years works in the low-wage sector.  According to the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), however, only one in twelve worked under the conditions of a fixed-term contract. Out of 38 million people employed in Germany in 2017, that is about 3.15 million workers, the German newspaper “Der Tagesspiegel” reports. Sahra Wagenknecht does not give a concrete number regarding fixed-term employment contracts but she says that “most of them are in temporary jobs”. We define the term “most people” as at least 50% of all employment contracts in Germany. Therefore, we rate this part of her claim to be false. We consider the overall statement to be largely true. However, the low-wage sector is not placed in a sufficient context. Sahra Wagenknecht completely ignores the positive effects of Agenda 2010.

On May 3, 2019,  “RIA Novosti” published an article, telling about reduction of voter interest in EP elections – a decrease in turnout. It reports that according to data provided by the European Parliament, which was analyzed by journalist of RIA Novosti, at the first elections to the European Assembly, which were held in 1979, the voter turnout of 9 member – countries of Union was 61.9%. In the second election held in 1989, with an increase in the number of participating states up to 12, turnout fell to 58.98%.  The publication reports that the activity of voters continued to fall steadily. For example, in the elections to the EP in 1999 with 15 EU members (49.51%), and in 2004 in the format of 25 community states (45.47%), as well as in 2007, when the EU expanded to 27 participants (42 , 97%). At the last elections of MEP’s in 2014, the voter turnout index in 28 EU countries dropped to 42.61% . The source to which the author refers was presented by the European Parliament review. In order to check the statement in the Russian material, we turned to the official website of the European Parliament and found a document (Review), which presents the results of a survey on voter turnout. On page 50, we found a table with data on the overall turnout at the European Parliament elections, starting in 1979. The data presented in the European Parliamentary Election Report indicate, that the information published on the “RIA Novisti” Internet portal is true and coincides with the figures presented. Thus, after analyzing the data of the Russian portal “RIA Novisti” and the data presented at the EP official website, we conclude that, indeed, voter turnout in the elections to the European Parliament (EP) has steadily decreased since the late 1970s, therefore, this information is true.

Kinnunen is the chairman of The Finns Party Youth and a candidate in the upcoming European Parliament elections. The tweet was part of the discussion around the Finnish parliamentary elections of 2019.  The Finns Party is in general against the federalisation of the European Union. Kinnunen wants Finland to have a strong independent military since he does not believe in other countries’ willingness to defend Finland. He has been talking about the topic actively especially on Twitter.  An opinion poll conducted by WIN/Gallup International in 2014 showed that the people’s willingness to defend their country is low in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. 29 percent of the French, 27 percent of the Brits, and 18 percent of the Germans were ready to stand for their country if needed. The sample size for the poll was around 1000 people per country. Compared to the populations of these countries this might look like a relatively low sample size, but it is a common number and the margin of error is very low. WIN/International Gallup can be deemed a trustworthy source. It was a  co-operation of two independent polling firms, the Gallup International Association and the Worldwide Independent Network of Market Research. These are some of the largest polling firms in their respective regions. The co-operation ended in 2017, and the poll about people’s willingness  to defend their country only remains in Gallup International’s Bulgarian division’s archaic-looking site, which seems a little odd. The site still is most likely authentic.  Common security policy in the EU gets a yes from Germany, France and the United Kingdom According to the Standard Eurobarometer conducted in 2018, many Europeans are in favour of a common defence and security policy among EU member states. 86 percent of the Germans, 74 percent of the French and 63 percent of the British are for this idea. It is noteworthy that Germany, France, and the United Kingdom belong to NATO. This leads us to think that the people of these countries trust that the EU will work together in the future, if a common security policy is needed. Also, according to a Forsa poll conducted on behalf of the RTL Group, Germans thought that Europe was not dependent on help from the outside, for example the United States. 37 percent thought that Europe needed military help from the US. The poll was conducted in July 2018. European Defence Agency has no statistics on the subject Asseri Kinnunen told us over the phone that to his recollection the WIN/Gallup International poll was the same one he referred to in his tweet. From the way he described the poll we have concluded that it is probably the same one. We have not found any other research on the topic. We asked if the European Defence Agency (EDA) had any information about the topic, and on 24 April we received an answer: “Unfortunately, we have no statistics or information about the topic you mentioned, nor do we know any other research done on this question or institution which could [you] provide you with the requested info.” Opinions have not changed much in Finland and Norway We looked at statistics from Finland and Norway for reference. These countries ask their citizens’ willingness to defend their country on a survey every year. The surveys are made by The Advisory Board for Defence Information (ABDI) in Finland and People and Defence in Norway. Both of these are in some way connected to the parliaments of these countries. We chose to investigate the surveys from 2014 to 2018 because the survey by WIN/Gallup International was conducted in 2014. Our goal was simply to see if the willingness to defend one’s own country had decreased or increased among these two countries. In Finland the willingness to defend one´s own country increased by 3 percentage points after 2014. During the following few years the percentage stayed at 87, but it decreased back to 84 in 2018. In Norway, the percentage grew by 8 percentage points from 67 in 2014 to 75 in 2017 but came down to 72 in 2018. These results show that while the willingness to defend one’s country can change over the years, it is unlikely to have a change of tens of percentage points in five years in the case of Germany, France or the United Kingdom either. A change of tens of percentage points would be needed before one could talk about a majority, that is over 50 percent. Conclusion Since we could not find any other surveys on this exact topic, we do not know if the opinions have changed in any way since 2014. A lot has happened in five years, so opinions could differ today. For example, the crisis and on-going war in Ukraine could have affected the results. It is reasonable to assume that there are no other polls on the topic, and therefore Kinnunen’s phrasing, which implied that there have been several studies on the subject, is incorrect. However, it remains unclear if other polls on the subject have been conducted that are yet to be published. We have concluded that Kinnunen’s claim is uncheckable. The only poll that was found supported his claim, but there does not seem to be any other research on the topic. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

On top of that, the EU loses 160 to 190 billion euros due to tax avoidance.” This is a claim by Belgian politician and MEP Kathleen Van Brempt. Astronomical numbers, but where do they come from? And how reliable can these estimations be? Kathleen Van Brempt mentions this in an article on the website of her political party sp.a (Belgian party of the social democrats) where she focuses on tax payments of multinationals. The article is a response to the adaptation of a new detailed roadmap to deal with tax evasion and tax avoidance by the European Parliament. It is essential to understand the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. “Tax avoidance is a legal way to avoid tax payment”, explains professor in Fiscal law Michel Maus from the VUB (Vrije Universiteit Brussel – university in Brussels). “For instance, you have a successful company which makes a fortune with the production of chocolate, let’s say 1 million a year. In Belgium, you have to pay 29% of taxes on the profit. However, in Ireland, it’s only 12%. So, smart as you are, you decide to create a daughter company in Ireland. You keep the managing aspect of your business located in Belgium, but you move your operational business, chocolate and your employees to Ireland. This way, you have to pay fewer taxes. Big experts in avoiding taxes are multinationals like Apple, but even small companies do this.” Illegal chocolate “By evading taxes, you are committing a fraud”, Maus continues. “There is no legal aspect to tax evasion. It’s the same principle as avoiding taxes: you create a daughter company on paper, but in practice, you don’t move your business to the address where your business is located on paper. For instance, your chocolate that should be located in Ireland is still being true Belgian chocolate on Belgian ground.” So, based on Kathleen Van Brempt’s claim, 825 billion is being evaded, which is illegal, while 160 to 190 billion is being avoided, which is legal. However, the article does not mention any source or studies on which these numbers are based. After contacting Van Brempt’s office, her press representative referred to two studies shared by the fractions of social democrats S&D. The first one is ‘The Fair Tax Report’, which was drafted by the S&D. The second one is ‘The European Tax Gap’, which is conducted by Richard Murphy, a professor in International Political Economy (City University London), on request of the S&D. In ‘The European Tax Gap’ report, Murphy suggests that the EU’s tax gap by evasion is between 700 billion and 900 billion euros and that these figures might even be an underestimation. Furthermore, the number of corporate tax avoidance is even less precise to estimate, and different amounts are suggested: from 50 billion to 190 billion euros a year. And that is a big difference of 140 billion euros a year. Murphy: “(…) it remains hard to estimate tax avoidance. It is certain that the tax gap estimation of €825 billion suggested in this report is understated as a consequence, but rather than present an estimate of the loss it is now considered more prudent to note that the problem exists. (…).” Still relevant today? As a source for the estimation for tax avoidance Murphy refers to a study from the European Parliamentary Research Service, which was conducted in 2015: ‘Bringing transparency, coordination and convergence to corporate tax policies in the European Union – Assessment of the magnitude of aggressive corporate tax planning‘. The press responsible of the European Parliament, John Schrans, says that Van Brempt’s claim is based on the European Parliament resolution of the 26th of March 2019 on ‘financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance’. The two following articles concern the numbers that Brempt mentions:  In article 24, it is stated that ‘(…) the latest estimates of tax evasion within the EU point to a figure of approximately EUR 825 billion per year’. This figure is the result of the same study of 2015 to which Kathleen Van Brempt referred and which is previously mentioned in the study by Richard Murphy. Article 19 of the report states that ‘the European Parliament recalls, in particular, the empirical assessment of the magnitude of annual revenue losses caused by aggressive corporate tax planning (ed. tax avoidance) in the EU which was drawn up in 2015; notes that the assessment ranges from EUR 50-70 billion (…) to EUR 160-190 billion (…).’ In other words, the amount of 160 billion to 190 billion euro is the result of observations.  Decreasing fiscal fraud Again, these numbers are based on the study of 2015, the same study to which Murphy referred. The following question that should be asked: is the study still relevant to the present day? And how come that a more precise calculation cannot be made concerning tax avoidance and tax evasion? Professor Maus shares his demur towards the 2015 study. “Fiscal fraud is difficult to measure precisely. To have objective and truthful numbers isn’t easy. The only numbers that we can be sure of are of what has been discovered of fiscal fraud or crime.’’ This explains why the numbers from Murphy balance in such a wide range. In his opinion, the study from 2015, apart from not being precise, might also not be completely reliable today. He refers to a study from Friedrich Schneider, a professor in Economy at the University of Lind: “Schneider created a model to calculate the black economy. Of course, you can criticise every calculation that has been made concerning tax fraud, but his method is based on comparing 120 countries with each other, and so he is capable of describing noticeable trends.” Schneider’s study, dating from 2017, shows that there is a slight decrease in fiscal fraud in Europe. So, it is possible to conclude that there is a change in numbers compared to 2015. To conclude, it is safe to state that Kathleen Van Brempt’s claim is based on actual numbers that are traceable to studies made on demand by the European Parliament. However, as professor Maus and his reference to professor Schneider shows, precise numbers concerning tax avoidance and evasion aren’t an exact science. Only assumptions or estimations can be made because we can only calculate what we know. And as you want to make as much money as possible with your chocolate production, you will not share your way of tax fraud with the world.

(Young European Survey) is a project created by the youths of different political parties. It was born with the purpose of knowing the claims of young Europeans citizens regarding the elections on the 26th of May. The organization created a survey to define the future of the European Union. However, the method used to collect data did not appear anywhere and there was a political strategy behind the project.   The first analysis  YES! (Young European Survey) was born fundamentally to know what political issues young people want from the next mandate of the European Parliament. The organization is formed by young volunteers from the different political parties that have participated in it. Between the 12th of October and the 8th of November, YES! carried out a survey lead by the young militants of Les Jeunes avec Macron from France with the support of other entities. The official results were published on YES!’s website and made reference to the following statements: the geographic areas studied, the age limit, the average age and the professional activities of the participants. Furthermore, the results were expressed in terms of: number of people that completed the survey (21.277), the percentage of people who do not feel freedom provided by Europe (72%), the percentage of people with the intention of voting on the 26th of May, and the percentage of citizens that feel European (82%). Based on the results discussed above, YES! drafted the different measures that the European Union should take from now on, taking into account what young citizens expect from this political institution. As a result, we were able to expose the weaknesses of YES! that allows us to question the reliability of its conclusions.  The political parties that have taken part in the project belong to the same ideological group. YES! did not inform of which specific geographic zones they analysed. The opinion poll was made by asking people randomly on the street. In the case of Spain, Ciudadanos did it differently, by pitching tents to draw people’s attention and make them fill in the survey.  These three ideas that we detected make us think that it was possible that the program YES! was a Push Pulling poll. The danger of this type of polls is that it can be a strained survey with premeditated questions, whose only aim is that its results match with their predetermined conclusion, generally based on a political incentive. The author and the source The movement responsible for the creation of you-th entity YES! project was Les Jeunes avec Macron. Notably, we have to mention Martin Bohmert, executive member of this group and of En Marche. The rest of the political parties that collaborated were Jóvenes Ciudadanos (Spain); Future Dem (Italy); Les Jeunes avec Macron and Jeunes Démocrates (France); Jeunes cdH, Jeunes MR and Jong VLD (Belgium); Jonge Democraten (The Netherlands); Junge Liberale NEOS (Austria); Momentum TizenX (Hungary); Mladí Progresívci (Slovakia) and Uniunea Salvați România (Romania). It is extremely important to point out that these organizations identify themselves as centrists, pro-European and anti-Brexit. Fact-check The primary source of the project, which is based on the results obtained in the survey, is not entirely reliable. We start by saying that the project has been promoted and maintained over time by political parties, i.e., entities with political and ideological intentions and with communicative strategies behind them. If we add to this the idea that all participants belong to the same ideological wing, we can affirm that behind the opinion poll there is a much greater intention than to know what the youth think about the EU: basically, saying that the young people want to remain European. As if this was not enough, the survey presents several methodological flaws, as Carles Pont, Doctor of Communication at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, sustains. First of all, it can be said that the sample of individuals surveyed is not representative, neither quantitatively nor qualitatively, of the universe of analysis. In a quantitative or numerical sense, for a survey to be representative, for example, in Spain, it has to be conducted on 1,500 people, given that, once this number is reached, the sampling error is very similar. So based on that information, in Europe it would have to be conducted on 24,000 people. However, only 21,277 people answered. Then, in a qualitative sense, the survey has to study who has participated. In this sense, the results of this one are very unclear when defining a profile. They only mention the geographic areas studied, the age limit of the people they have surveyed, their average age and their professional activity, but in a superficial and insufficient way. Even then, one can appreciate the mistakes that they have made: only a few countries from the European Union (9 out of 28) have been surveyed. Only 9 countries of the 28 countries that form the European Union have participated in the project. Source: YES! (Young European Survey)   Furthermore, the age of the participants does not respond to any logical pattern, since there is a great difference between a person of 15 and 35 years of age – not to mention that underage do not even have the right to vote. Additionally, the average age is not justified in any way, since the number of people of each age who has participated in the survey does not appear, and neither does the number of people surveyed in each country. We cannot forget that it would not be advisable to report which correct areas of each European country have been analysed since the results can vary greatly depending on whether one asks in working-class neighbourhoods or high-class areas. The contextualization of the data, or research work, is hard to find in this project.   The survey was formed by 12 questions: 7 with a simple answer and 5 with an open answer. Source: YES! (Young European Survey)   Finally, the process of gathering information, has we have already specified, is incorrect. The surveys were done online and also in the street. As Martin Bohmert explained, the electronic surveys were sent mostly to the members of the parties that participated, whereas regarding the surveys that took place in the street and in the tents, participants were young people selected randomly. That means that the interviewees are not a good reflection of the universe that the survey originally intended to analyse. For instance, a Spanish citizen who votes for Podemos would never approach Ciudadanos tent. Ergo, they would have never participated in the YES! project because, directly, they would have never known about its existence. In conclusion, we can summarize that the survey has not been done correctly. It is all a huge communicative strategy marked by a Push Pulling poll with the aim of making young people recover trust in the future and in the progress of Europe. The political communication strategy is correct; the mistake is the way of selling the survey as if it was legitimate. So, after all the investigation and having identified the flaws of the survey, we can conclude that the claims that YES!  accurately represents the views of Young European citizens are mostly false.

This false claim was made on 12th April 2019 in a press meeting at the Finnish bureau of the European Parliament in Helsinki.Sarvamaa made the claim when asked what differences parties have and why people should vote the European People’s Party (EPP). According to Sarvamaa the EPP strives to make investments for research and innovation. Investing in these would benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), which hold a strong position as employers in the EU area, he adds.Sarvamaa represents the centre-right National Coalition Party of Finland, which is a member of the EPP. He was ranked as the 14th most influential member of the European Parliament by a non-governmental organization VoteWatch in April 2019.Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union. In their statistic Annual enterprise statistics by size class for special aggregates of activities it is stated that in 2016, more than 99 percent of all enterprises operating in the European Union area were small or medium-sized enterprises. The statistics show the employee numbers in different size classes operating in the European Union area. According to European Commission Press Officer Mirna Talko the Commission estimates that 99 percent of the enterprises are SME.The European Commission published a User Guide to the SME Definition in 2016. It tells us that the size class is important to know so that financial support given by the European Union can be targeted to those enterprises who need it.Definition of small and medium-sized enterprisesAccording to the User Guide to the SME Definition it’s not always easy to define what small and medium-sized enterprises are. The problems in defining them arise from diverse ownerships and holdings between different enterprises. The enterprise might have a small or medium-sized by characteristics, but it might hold notable resources, if it is connected with large companies.The official definition of small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union is published in the European Union Official Journal issue L124. It states that the enterprises in this category are those which: – employ no more than 250 employees AND – their revenue is no more than 50 million euros OR their balance is no more than 43 million euros AND – no more than 25 percent is owned by an enterprise that is not an SME.The claim is exaggeratedSarvamaa claimed that small and medium-sized enterprises employ 90 percent of the workforce in the EU area. Eurostat statistics Annual enterprise statistics by size for special aggregates of activities shows that the workforce working for SME was 66.7 percent in 2016. The statistics was updated on March 2019 and the most recent information available is from 2016.The article deals with only those employed by enterprises and specifies those who are employed by SME enterprises. It does not include the share of employers of the public sector or the third sector. It also ignores the unemployed.The User Guide to the SME Definition by European Commission states that in the EU area: ”Nine out of every ten enterprises is an SME, and SMEs generate two out of every three jobs.” According to President of the European commission Jean-Claude Juncker small and medium-sized enterprises created more than 85 percent of the job openings during the years 2010-2015.The claim is false. Small and medium-sized enterprises have a significant role as an employer in the European Union, but a share of 90 percent does not hold true. The Eurostat statistic clearly shows the share accounts for 66.7 percent. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

To his mind, reducing national CO2 emissions is not effective. In this fact check we show that Bernhard uses correct numbers but interprets them in a misleading way. AfD politician Marc Bernhard, who, as a member of the German parliament (Bundestag), deals with the issues of climate change and driving bans, among others, expressed his criticism of German climate protection policy at a meeting of the Environment Committee in the Bundestag on 20 February 2019. There, he said: “In the Paris climate protection agreement, which the government signed, we committed ourselves to extensive reductions in CO2. However, the same agreement stipulates that emerging economies and developing countries that generate around 60% of the world’s CO2, such as China and India, may increase their CO2 emissions indefinitely by 2030. The German share of man-made CO2 is just 1.8%. How relevant is the German CO2 avoidance strategy actually?” In his speech, Bernhard described that Germany had committed itself in the Paris climate protection agreement to extensive reductions of CO2. At the same time, however, this agreement regulates that emerging and developing countries (e.g. China), which generate 60% of the world’s CO2, may emit unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide by 2030. Furthermore, he criticizes that the German share of man-made CO2 is only 1.8%, thus questioning the necessity of the German CO2 avoidance strategy. The main topic of the committee’s meeting was carbon dioxide emissions from heavy commercial vehicles. Climate change is also an explosive topic in this year’s European elections, and there are several positions on it. The measures for the German mitigation strategy in particular are the subject of intense debate among the individual parties in the Bundestag. But what measures has Germany really committed itself to and how do they relate to the regulations in developing countries? First step of our research On request to his sources used, a scientific assistant of the politician sent us three statements to the Bundestag by different professors and a request, related to the energy concept 2010 of his party (AfD). All statements sent to us doubt a climate change with harmful consequences for the earth: a statement by Prof. Nir Shaviv of the Hewbrew University of Jerusalem, a review by Prof. Horst Joachim Lüdecke, a retired professor of HTW Saar, and a statement by Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning who works in the energy sector. In the first part of his statement, Mr. Bernhard talks about Germany’s commitment to extensive reductions in CO2 emissions. Article 4 of the Paris Agreement stipulates that each Party “shall take national mitigation measures”. In addition, developed countries, including Germany, should “continue to take the lead by committing themselves to absolute macroeconomic emission reduction targets”. Thus the first part of Bernhard’s assertion is true. In the following sentence he switches from Germany to developing countries such as China. They allegedly produce 60% of the world’s CO2 and, according to the Paris Agreement, may increase their emissions indefinitely until 2030. However, they will still have to invest in renewable energies and climate protection, which will then be reflected in falling emissions by 2030 at the latest. Article 4 of the Agreement also states that developing countries have a longer period of time to reach their peak. At the peak, emissions no longer rise but begin to fall. To achieve this goal, developing countries should be supported by developed countries. One reason for this time span is, among other things, that developed countries increasingly produce their goods in developing countries, which leads to high production emissions in these countries. A report by the German news website “Spiegel” explains this. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan also stipulates that by 2020 the country should replace around 15% of its energy needs with renewable energy sources. Efforts are therefore being made not to allow emissions to rise unchecked. So, Bernhard’s basic statement is true but misleading in the context applied. The reasons for China’s permitted increase in emissions are ignored. As a criticism of the German CO2 avoidance strategy, Bernhard recently emphasizes that the German share of man-made CO2 is only 1.8%. A statistic of the Federal Ministry for the Environment from 2015 confirms his statement with a GermanCO2 share of 1.9%. However, it is important to note in this context that the outsourcing of German companies generates production emissions abroad. If one also compares the population of China with Germany, it can quickly be seen that the former, at 1.386 billion (as of 2017), is many times larger than Germany, at 82.79 million (as of 2017). However, the annualCO2 emissions of a German citizen are around 9.6 tons. This is about twice the international average of 4.8 tons. In conclusion, it can be said that Marc Bernhard’s statement is based on true facts, which, however, are put into a false context and are misleading for the reader. The figures Bernhard quotes are not related to the means or sizes of the individual countries. The selection of his sources is one-sided, as everyone expresses a sceptical basic attitude towards climate change and the other side is disregarded.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Magdalena Hönig and Louisa Huttenlocher, Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, DE   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

According to him the European Union has no hard power to sanction Spain. We rate this claim as false.  Cartoon: Giorgi Zibzibadze Professor politics Hendrik Vos of the University of Ghent says that Europe could do something about it, but that there has to be a political will. Among the other member states there is no willingness.  “The problem with this case is that there has to be a majority of member states that agree on starting the procedure, and there wasn’t. It is pretty clear that Spain did something wrong and that the way they treated the Catalonian separatists was out of line. There are reports of Amnesty International or Human Rights that could indicate that Spain has violated the fundamental rights. Europe could then start a procedure to ask for an explanation and then secondly, Europe could punish Spain for its actions.” Hungary and Poland Professor of Political Science at the University of Antwerp Stefaan Walgrave agrees with Hendrik Vos although he does not dare to say with a 100% certainty whether Europe can effectively do something about the Spanish policy against the separatists. “The question is whether Europe politically can react to that policy. The EU needs the cooperation of all the 28 European member states. But it is not evident that they are willing to speak out openly about a conflict that is occurring within Spain.” “But if the member states dare to cooperate, Europe has an institutional footing to stand up”, Walgrave continues. “There are enough rules that allow the EU to sanction Spain, as the Union has already done with Hungary and Poland. These countries did not fully comply with European legal rules. But it is not obvious that this could possibly happen in the Spanish case.” Self interest Why won’t the member states start a procedure against Spain? According to Hendrik Vos each country acts out of own interest. “It is a case of intern legal order and the countries in Europe don’t want to be involved if it is something internal.” Bart Maddens, political scientist at KU Leuven, says that the reason for the EU not wanting Catalonia to be independent has to do with its fear that there will be a ‘domino effect’. That means that the EU is afraid that Catalonian independency would encourage the Scots, the Flemish, the Corsicans,… to also become independent. The European Union considers that a threat: the fear for destabilization is why the EU does not act against the Spanish government. “One would at least expect that the European Union does its research in what happens exactly in Spain, like it did with Hungary and Polen. But Spain has too much power for the EU to engage with the Catalonian issue.” In short, according to the experts we spoke to, the EU is too divided to act in the Spanish-Catalonian case. Another aspect is that the EU member states fear a domino effect of separatist movements standing up. On the other hand, there are no legal obstacles that prevent the EU to do something about the way Spain deals with the Catalonian separatists. Therefore we conclude the claim is false.

However, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, president of the association, thinks there is a health risk for students if a country switches to summer time permanently: The probability of sleeping and learning problems, depression and diabetes has demonstrably massively increased, he is quoted by the news portal “Merkur.de”. The empirical basis for this claim is good but not perfect. Basically, humans adjust their internal clock to the time when the daily sun position has reached its highest point, the biological noon. For example, the biologist and medical scientific journalist Maren Schenk describes the relationships between the organism and time change in the “Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift”, a German medical journal of the Thieme Verlag in Stuttgart, published on 25 October 2012. If the clock is put forward by one hour this system falls into imbalance, which is the reason why many people suffer from the time change and complain about sleeping disorders and organic ailments.  On 29th of March in 2018, the online magazine “Riffreporter” published the article: “Die Zeitumstellung ist kein Mini-Jetlag, sondern schlimmer” (“The time change is not a mini jet lag, but worse”). Chronobiologist Till Roenneberg of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich thinks that the clock change is not the only health risk, but there’s also the already existing lack of sleep in the population. “The current summer time regime simply moves our social obligations eastward for one time zone without leaving our biological time zone,” says Roenneberg. Above all, pupils and students are affected by the permanent summer time, because at a young age people’s inner rhythm shifts. With too little sleep it is increasingly difficult to process the material taught. According to the above statements, a biological adaptation to the changed time for humans is therefore not really possible. The clock change without a changing course of the sun alongside the chronobiological rhythm adapting to that change can subsequently lead to permanent drowsiness and fatigue. Poor sleep leads to health problems The sleep hormone melatonin plays a major role in the discussion of the permanent changeover to summer time. The hormone enormously affects the biological clock of the human body. It is secreted during the dark hours by the pineal gland of the brain. In the morning, the melatonin level drops again. If the biological rhythm is ignored or manipulated as in time change or during periods of shift work, this can lead to significant health consequences. The journal “Life Sciences” published a study called “Association between light at night, melatonin secretion, sleep deprivation, and the internal clock: Health impacts and mechanisms of circadian disruption” on March 15th, 2017. It shows that especially in shiftworking, the effect of artificial light and thus the suppression of natural melatonin secretion at night leads to a disruption of both the circadian system, the sleep-wake rhythm of humans and to chronic sleep deprivation. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that this desynchronization of night shift workers has long-term unhealthy consequences such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular risk and obesity. As a result of the changeover to summer time, the adaptation process of the organism to the light conditions is thus considerably disturbed and also has an effect on other biological processes in the human body. On the 16th of March, 2011 the German medical journal “Der Internist” published a scientific article titled “Schlechter Schlaf als Risikofaktor für das metabolische Syndrom” (“Poor sleep as a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome”). According to epidemiological studies, there is clear evidence of a link between sleep duration, sleep quality and the risk of developing diabetes mellitus as part of metabolic syndrome, the combination of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity, hypertension and lipid metabolism disorder. According to the journal, several studies show that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus with a sleep duration of less than 5 hours or more than 9 hours is twice as high as with an 8-hour sleep duration, including “The Nurses Health Study” from the 1980s. Expert asks for a cautious interpretation But not only the duration of sleep but also the qualitity of sleep has an influence on the development of diabetes. Clinical experimental studies such as “Slow-wave sleep and the risk of type 2 diabetes in humans” in 2008 showed that poor sleep is one cause of a disturbed energy metabolism. This leads to increased appetite and hunger, a reduction in insulin sensitivity, i. e. the sensitivity of the body cells to insulin, a heightened appetite and hunger sensation as well as a lack of exercise in everyday life. All these are factors and triggers for the metabolic syndrome in humans. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome can certainly be triggered by other sleep disorders. Endocrinologist PD Dr. med. Norbert Lotz of the Diabetes Center in Kempten, Bavaria, however is of the opinion: “A frequent coincidence of diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome and sleep disorder is proven only for the sleep apnea syndrome.” Therefore sleep apnea, accumulated nocturnal breathing pauses with oxygen deficiency in the brain, must be excluded in advance in order to evaluate the described relationships. This disease has been proven to increase the risk of diabetes. That’s why the conclusion that sleep deprivation generally leads to an increased risk for this metabolic disorder is not sufficiently proven by randomized studies. Here still exists considerable need for medical research. Summing everything up, it is difficult to regard the statement of the German Teachers’ Association that a permanent switch to Daylight Saving Time leads to sleep or learning problems as well as to depression and diabetes as a given fact. The switch certainly carries risks for learning and sleep problems. But so far current medical studies show no clear evidence for the development of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and defined mental illness due to general sleep deprivation. Therefore the claim is judged to be only mostly true.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Annika Bingger, Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, DE   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

175;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-the-eu-continues-to-pay-to-turkey/;“The EU continues to pay to Turkey”;2019-05-08;eufactcheck;;On March 23rd, 2019 Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria’s vice-chancellor and party head of the right wing party FPÖ, stated that “Turkey continues to receive European tax money” and demanded on his Facebook page that EU payments towards Turkey had to stop. But is it true that the EU is still paying money to Turkey as a candidate country? The answer is yes.  Here the original claim: “The EU (Karas’ EPP and Schieder’s Socialists) rejected our request to discontinue accession negotiations with Turkey and suspended the negotiations only in time. Turkey continues to receive European tax money. We, the Freedom Party, want to make a clear line with our European partners: to completely abolish the accession negotiations and not to make payments to Turkey.” What the EU pays The EU pays money to Turkey, even quite a lot. In the period from 2014 to 2020 Turkey is entitled to 4.5 billion Euros according to official information on the website of the European Commission. It receives the money as part of a so-called pre-accession assistance which should help a candidate country to implement reforms towards the EU’s goals. So far, in this period a few hundred million have been paid out. The money will go to projects strengthening civil society and the rule of law, energy projects, education and agriculture. This should facilitate adaptation to EU standards. The EU rapporteur to Turkey, Kati Piri, argued in the past that the payments should not be stopped as NGOs in Turkey would also benefit from them. Many funds are also flowing into Turkish infrastructure projects some of which are linked to the ruling AKP party as reported by German weekly “Die Zeit”. The EU can not simply award the money to civil society groups. Turkey has a say in the use of pre-accession aid. This was criticized by the European Court of Auditors. Irrespective of this financial assistance, Turkey receives money through the so-called 2016 Ankara Refugee Agreement. The agreement provides for EU payments to Turkey for the promise of letting fewer refugees into Europe. A total of 6 billion Euros has been set aside of which 3.2 billion Euros have already been paid. This means that even if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to end as demanded by the FPÖ, there would be payments to Turkey. The pre-accession aid would disappear, but the refugee agreement would continue. The question is if Turkey is willing to preserve the Ankara Refugee Agreement if the pre-accession assistance were to be cut. The FPÖ’s goal is to cut all European tax money which Turkey received due to their status as a pre-accession country. But what about the Ankara Refugee Agreement?  A spokesperson from the FPÖ confirmed that the FPÖ was in favor of the Refugee Agreement, as the party wants less refugees to come to Europe and believes into help programs on site. At the same time, the FPÖ added, that in case that Greece stops to deport refugees to Turkey, the Ankara Refugee Agreement would lose its original purpose and should be abandoned. So FPÖ party leader Heinz-Christian Strache’s statement that Turkey continues to receive money from the EU is true. Also his statement that it is taxpayer’s money that is spent, holds true. The EU budget consists largely of certain shares of the respective member states. The calculation of these shares is based on gross national income.

176;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-unemployment-in-italy-is-significantly-growing/;“Unemployment in Italy is  growing significantly”;2019-05-07;eufactcheck;;On May 4th, Nicola Zingaretti – newly elected secretary of the Italian Democratic Party – firmly stated that, “under the current Lega – Movimento 5 stelle government, the unemployment rate is consistently growing”. This claim has turned out to be false. In Cremona, as shown in a local newspaper, Zingaretti explained that “economy stopped, companies’ turnovers collapsed, and unemployment increased”. In Reggio Emilia too, aswering to several questions from the press about the current government, he described Italian economy as nefarious: “Matteo Salvini forgot to say that, since he started his proxy, there are less job positions available, more unemployment, and a lower production rate for companies.” But these words are not actually reliable. The last figures published by Istat (National Institute of Statistics) in March 2019 showed that, from Giuseppe Conte’s settlement day (June 4th, 2018), unemployment hasn’t grown neither in terms of rate (a percentage based on workforce) nor absolute figures (number of unemployed persons). Instead, these indicators have continuously fluctuated, without consistent increase or decrease, and their values, in the long run, have actually dropped.  As you can see in the graphic, under the Lega – Movimento 5 Stelle cabinet, unemployment rate stayed still between 10.7% and 10.1%. Starting from a 10.7% in June 2018, Istat registered a 10.1% in August 2018 and a 10.7% in October 2018. From November 2018, this rate has slightly decreased: 10.5% in December 2018, 10.4% in January 2019, 10.5% in February 2019, 10.2% in March 2019 (last updated figure). This last value is the lowest one in the last 7 months, but not in the whole range of time (from Conte cabinet’s settlement to now, the lowest rate has been registered in August 2018). These figures show that Italian unemployment rate has decreased in the long run and, overall, its growth never got past the starting point (10.7%).  The number of people without a job is falling too, following the same variations of the unemployment rate. As the graphic shows, in June 2018 there are 2.700.000 unemployed persons, while in August 2018 there are 2.611.000. From September 2018 to February 2019, we get back to 2.700.000, while, in March 2019, the number falls until 2.641.000. This last data is the lowest one in the last 7 months (things change if we consider the whole time the Conte’s cabinet has been in charge until now, because the minimum has been reached in August 2018). This means in the long run, the number of unemployed persons has decreased and, overall, its growth never got past the starting point (2.790.000 units). From June 2018 until March 2019, both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons (if we consider absolute figures) are lower than those registered during Gentiloni’s government, from December 2016 to May 2018. During this range of time, ISTAT showed that the unemployment rate changed from 11.8% in December 2016 to 10.6% in May 2018, whereas the number of unemployed persons went from 3.050.000 to 2.755.000. Either way, in the long run, these values have decreased but, compared to the results scored by Conte’s cabinet, they seem way higher. Therefore, looking at the updated figures, Zingaretti’s statements about unemployment in Italy (referring to a huge growth of unemployment during Conte’s government, with no comparisons to the prior legislature, and to a way higher unemployment rate if compared to the one registered during Gentiloni’s government) are both false.

Is this just another speculative Trump-Tweet or a disconcerting development? Since the beginning of 2017, the Federal Office for Migrants and Refugees (German acronym: BAMF) publishes statistics on how many people are seeking asylum in Germany. It also describes the development from 2014 to 2018. The highest rise happened 2015 with an increase of almost 373% in comparison to the year before. Since then, the number of asylum-seeking people has decreased continuously. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was about 11.8%. Last year, only 164,693 people sought asylum in Germany which is 31% less than 2014 – the year before the sudden increase in numbers. This factcheck will only focus on the years 2014 to 2018 because Donald Trump probably refers to this period. The German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) releases an anual report on the status of crime in Germany in conjuction with immigration. This report shows not only the overall crime rate but also the rate of various types of crime. The numbers used in this report are from the police crime statistic (PKS), a well known source and the most-quoted crime statistic in Germany. The PKS ist also published by the BKA. Trump has only tweeted about “crime“ and didn’t mention any specific types of crime. Therefore, this factcheck will look at the overall crime rate as well as three types of crime which Trump could have meant: offences against life, offences against sexual self-determination and acts of brutality/crimes against personal freedom.    Developments in crime in GermanyInfogram Overall crime: The number of offences has decreased in the last couple of years. Only in 2016 did it rise by 0.04%. With 3,045,321 offences, 2018 is the year with the lowest crime rate in the reviewed time period. A rise of ten percent did not happen. Offences against life: This type of crime encompasses murder, homicide and manslaughter. Attempts are also counted. Since 2015, the number of solved cases rises steadily. 2018 is the year with the highest number of offences against life: 3007 cases are a ten percent increase compared to 2015. However, the 2018 data includes the truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin in 2016. Due to this, dozens of injured victims are included in this statistic. Therefore the data from 2018 and 2015 are not easily comparable because the difference can be attributed to a single terrible attack. Offences against sexual self-determination: This type comprises rape, sexual abuse of children and sexual duress. Attempts are also counted. Striking is the rise of crimes since 2015 and especially the increases since 2016 with 18.4% and 15.4% respectively. The numbers of 2018 are 40% above those of 2014. This increase might be due to a reform in legislation on sex offences in 2016. Part of the reform is the “no means no“ principle which strenghtens the victim’s rights. Today, an offence may be regarded as rape even if the victim doesn’t defend oneself actively. It’s enough if the victim expresses, verbally or non-verbally, that she or he does not consent to the actions. Another reform is that inappropiate grabbing is defined as crime and counted as sexual molesting. Brutality/offences against personal freedom: This type of offence is defined as bodily injuries, robbery, deprivation of liberty, duress, threat or kidnapping. As before, attempts are also counted. The only increase from one year to another was in 2016 with 6.7% more than 2015. Although the numbers are currently decreasing, there was an increase of 3.5% since 2015. The statement of Donald Trump is mostly false. The number of crimes has been decreasing for the past three years. The development “since migrants were accepted“ shows a decrease of 3.7% from 2015 to 2018. With regard to offences against personal freedom, we do not see a ten percent increase in this period. There is a ten percent increase in the sector of offences against life but the high level of 2018 is due to a single terrorist attack in Berlin. The large increase of 40% regarding offences against sexual-determination could be attributed to a reformed legislation about what counts as such an offence: The numbers before and after 2016 do not allow a useful comparison. But in the years after the refomation, an increase of more than ten percent is found. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

178;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-still-millions-of-fraudulent-diesel-cars-driving-around-in-eu/;“Still millions of fraudulent diesel cars driving around in EU”;2019-05-03;eufactcheck;;Dutch MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy recently tweeted that there are still millions of fraudulent diesel cars driving around in Europe. He also claims that the European Union does not take any proper action against those vehicles. But are these numbers correct? And do EU-countries truly ignore what is better known as ‘dieselgate’?   Visualisation ‘sjoemeldiesels’ © GIPA Caucasus School of Journalism and Media Management The dieselgate, or also known as the emission scandal, dates back to 2015. At that time the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published their Notice of Violation which stated that Volkswagen and Audi did not comply with the Clean Air Act, while both car manufactures claimed to meet the EPA emission standards. They eventually admitted that corrupted software was worldwide installed in millions of diesel vehicles. This software influenced the outcome of the nitrogen oxide emission-test during vehicle inspections. The acceptable emission limits of new vehicles sold in the EU are defined in a series of EU directives. According to these directives, in line with the EPA’s findings, the diesels did not meet the EU emission standards.  Source: Twitter, 2019 ‘’Still millions of fraudulent diesel cars driving around in EU’’ On 18 September 2018 the European Federation for Transport and Environment (EFTE) published their research to dirty diesels. This is also the source that Gerbrandy used for the facts in his tweet. The figure below, which is from the research, states how many dirty diesels there are in almost every country in the EU. However, the source only refers to dirty diesels and not fraudulent diesels. This proves that Gerbrandy used an inappropriate source, because he speaks of fraudulent diesel vehicles and not dirty diesels. A diesel car can be dirty even when there has not been tampered with.  Source: EFTE, 2018 ‘’It is clearly a European problem, but EC nor member states go for a European approach’’ Furthermore, Gerbrandy claims that individual member states and the EU as a whole avoid the issue. The European Court of Auditors published on 7 February 2019 a briefing document which contains the plans and previous efforts of the EU around fraudulent diesels. The document mentions several efforts in EU member states, including Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the UK. In addition, the documents states that almost all car manufacturers recalled fraudulent diesels. Despite these individual efforts the EU stays quiet. The aforementioned briefings document reports that none of the member states imposes fines to producers who are accused of selling fraudulent diesels, or as it is said in the document: ‘’The Member States have not imposed any penalties on manufacturers for breaches of type-approval regulation. So far, at least three Member States have imposed fines for breaches of commercial or consumer law’’. The three member states that have imposed fines are Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Conclusion Following the research from the EFTE, the millions that Gerbrandy mentions are unknown. The source is not about fraudulent diesels but dirty diesels and there are no further investigations that can confirm Gerbrandy’s statement. The other part of the claim is mostly false. There are several efforts from individual member states, but those efforts are not effective. Also, only three of the 28 member states have imposed fines. Furthermore, the member states all try to take care of this issue individually, but there is no European policy. This is why we rate this claim as mostly false.

179;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-electric-cars-generate-higher-emissions-than-diesel-cars/;“Electric cars generate higher emissions than diesel cars”;2019-05-02;eufactcheck;;According to a study conducted by the Ifo, under the leadership of German physics professor Christoph Buchal, the CO2 emissions of electric vehicles are higher than those of diesel cars. The Belgian newspaper De Standaard published this claim on their website on the 18th of April. We rate this claim as mostly false. Europe wants to reduce the CO2 emissions of its transport sector by 40% by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, Germany wants to stimulate the transition to electric cars. However, a study conducted by Ifo under the direction of Professor Christoph Buchal shows that in Germany, the CO2 emissions of electric vehicles are higher than those of diesel cars. At least, that’s what the study says using a comparison between the Tesla Model 3 and the Mercedes C220d diesel car. There are two reasons why the diesel car is considered as ‘better’ than an electric car. First of all, there is the production of the battery for an electric car. This production requires a considerable amount of energy. In addition, the batteries contain various raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, and these raw materials have to be mined. This means that the production of a Tesla Model 3 battery releases some 11 to 15 tonnes of CO2, according to the German researchers. They also take an average lifetime of ten years per battery and assume that people will drive around 15,000 kilometres per year. If we take these data, a Tesla Model 3 would emit 73 to 98 grams of CO2 per kilometre.  Secondly, and very important in this study, the research was conducted in Germany. The conditions and means by which the batteries are produced must therefore be taken into account. In Germany, on average, more than a third of the electricity is produced from lignite and charcoal, which are by far the largest emitters of CO2 among electricity producers. If we look at Belgium, where the electricity is mainly derived from low-CO2 nuclear or renewable energy, we see that the emission of electric cars there is on average three to four times lower than that of an internal combustion engine. So the claim of the German researchers is not completely wrong as far as Germany is concerned, but it is not at all representative for the whole world. We have also enlisted the help of some experts in the field to investigate this claim and to see what is true and what is not. First in line is Gunter De Pooter, expert in sustainable transport: “There is indeed, worldwide, a discussion on this subject, which has been going on for about two years’, he says. ‘Back in 2017, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has also published an article, questioning the green image of electric cars. All these articles give rise to fact-checking, which is important in the world of electric driving because the truth is always in the middle and there will always be supporters and opponents.” Irrelevant discussion “When comparing an electric motor with an internal combustion engine, it becomes clear that the latter requires up to 4 to 5 times more energy to make the same mechanical movement. The electric motor has very little energy loss, which explains why they’re widely used. Not only in cars but also in factories, because they’re really energy efficient. An electric motor in an industrial installation has a loss of  only 3-4%, and the same applies to cars. Other than that, the lifespan of such an engine is 5 to 6 times longer than that of an internal combustion engine. So, a diesel engine needs more energy, which means that it will also emit more CO2 and on top of that the engine has a shorter lifespan. Two arguments in favour of the electric motor”, tells De Pooter. However, there’s a big discussion going on, explains De Pooter: “What about the environmental cost, the impact of making a battery and where will the power come from? These are all things that, in general, are known very little about. Much depends on the quality of the battery. If the materials in the battery are not of sufficient quality, the car will not operate optimally. And it is very important to know that these factors vary from country to country.” Rare materials We also spoke with Mark Pecqueur, lecturer in vehicle technologies at Thomas More University College in Mechelen, Belgium. He clarified that Buchal’s claim would be correct in the past, but not anymore today because the electric cars have greatly evolved the last few years together with the production of their batteries: “Moreover, Buchal has only compared two models so that seems insufficient to draw such a general conclusion.”“In the past, the production of electric cars demanded a lot of energy. Old electric cars in Germany, from 5 or 6 years old were indeed not the best alternative. But when we look at the more recent electric cars, it quickly becomes clear that the energy we need to produce the batteries has dropped dramatically. And also the way in which the batteries are produced had evolved”, Pecqueur says. Like Gunter De Pooter, he refers here to the low-carbon energy used in Belgium, but also to the environmentally unfriendly materials used in Germany Besides that, the use of rare materials such as cobalt is an issue that still needs to be solved, Mark Pecquer continues: “These materials are often produced in appalling conditions and sometimes even involve child labour. We have to look for materials that are not that rare, and that’s something that’s not given enough attention to these days. If we don’t use alternatives for these rare materials in the long run, we’ll be faced with a problem. We should take an example from China, where hydrogen is used. This avoids the use of rare materials on the one hand and on the other it brings along zero emissions. However, I think it will take a long time before the electric cars really break through and we will all be convinced that this is the best solution.” We can conclude that the claim: ‘Electric cars generate higher emissions than diesel cars’ is mostly false. The German investigators have only compared two models: an electric Tesla Model 3 and a Mercedes C220d diesel car. Secondly, Buchal and his coworkers did an investigation in Germany and then generalized their claim. More than a third of the electricity in Germany is produced from lignite and charcoal, which are by far the largest emitters of CO2 among electricity producers. Finally, in the last few years, the electric cars have greatly evolved and so has the production of their batteries. The investigation of the German researchers is interesting but the information is not representative on a large scale and is also a bit obsolete. Therefore, this claim is mostly false.

The claim turns out to be mostly false. The statement rose some questions in the media and provoked discussion on the dangers of 5G signal. It is obviously a hot topic and also a scientific debate. We wanted to check whether the information Mr Lukanić provided in his statement were true or false. The Croatian political party Živi Zid (Human Shield) has joined a group of anti-establishment parties, so called “populist parties” including Cinque stelle Movement from Italy, Kukiz15 from Poland and a Greek party, Akkel. They also presented similar programmes ahead of the European Parliament election in May. Tomislav Lukanić, a European Parliament candidate in the upcoming elections in a press conference said the following: ”The unregulated system now wants to upgrade to the 5G network, though more than 200 scientists from 40 countries appealed to the UN and the World Health Organization to wait for it to be introduced because they have not fully explored possible adverse effects on human health, all based on about 10,000 scientific research files.” The first thing we did was call Mr Lukanić’s political party office. Surprisingly, they did not provide any answers to our query about the content of the statement. In our research we found that Mr Lukanić’s statement refers to the 5G Space Appeal that was initially submitted in September 2018 to the European Commission. Our next step was to investigate who signed this appeal, what these files are, if the numbers were correct and if the system was unregulated as Mr Lukanić claims. As all different claims in this statement are connected, we decided to investigate all of them. At the time of writing of this article, there is a list of more than 300 scientists from 45 countries who have signed the Appeal. The numerical aspect of Mr Lukanić’s statement seems to match the Appeal’s numerical information output. However, the exact number cannot be confirmed with great certainty as the only way to do this would be to contact each scientist whose name is listed and ask them to confirm that they support the Appeal. Furthermore, while 5G Space Appeal does offer a list of scientists who have signed it, it is difficult to see a criteria pattern for a scientist that can sign the petition. Overview of the references shows that not every scientist has expertise in the field of networks, or mobile technologies or even technologies. Questions about the requirements to sign the petition could be raised. Nevertheless, anyone can sign the petition and then the signees are sorted into categories. A key factor in Mr. Lukanić’s statement is the 10,000 scientific research files that apparently prove the harmful side effects which could potentially stop the development and implementation of 5G technology in countries like Croatia. The 5G Space Appeal clearly lists scientific research files (stated under “References” section of the Appeal) that are so important to our European Parliament candidate Tomislav Lukanić. After thorough research, we found that there are only about 7,000 scientific research files referred to in support of the Appeal, 3,000 files less than the number Mr Lukanić mentioned. However, numbers aside, the most surprising factor was the untimeliness of the majority of the research offered in the Appeal. Over 5000 research files are more than 20 years old, some even from the 1970s when 5G was not even considered to be an option for the future, let alone discussed or directly researched. This also imposes a question of a qualitative and quantitative value of these research files. In addition, some of the research was done by activist groups, which could suggest a conflict of interests and a credibility issue. Investigate Europe, a crosschecking European organisation has confirmed that there is almost no existent research on the effect of higher frequencies needed for 5G so far. Nevertheless, the research studies that investigate potential of harmful effects of 5G technology shouldn’t be overlooked and many are underway. No amount of research studies has yet proven this technology is completely unharmful either. Scientists argue that the emission of nonionizing radiation from those base stations might mostly affect human skin and environment.  In one research article The human skin as a sub-THz receiver – Does 5G pose a danger to it or not? by Betzalela et al, the conclusion is the following: “There is enough evidence to suggest that the combination of the helical sweat duct and wavelengths approaching the dimensions of skin layers could lead to non-thermal biological eﬀects. Such fears should be investigated and these concerns should also eﬀect the deﬁnition of standards for the application of 5G communications.“ Therefore, even though Mr Lukanić reffers to an appeal that has dubious research files in the reference list, the potential of harmful effects of 5G technology should be taken into account as a valid concern. Meanwhile, the European Comission has made a “5G for Europe Action Plan” which supports the implementation of 5G by the end of this decade. Finally, Mr Lukanić says that the system in Croatia is unregulated when it comes to the matter of 5G technologies, but according to the Croatian telecommunications company Croatian Telecom, Croatia has one of the strictest laws concerning allowed exposure to nonionizing radiation among European Union members. The company points out that the Ordinance on protection against electromagnetic fields issued by the Croatian Ministry of Health stands out as safer than most in the EU. The 5G network implementation programmes experts from Croatian Telecom insist that the number of network base stations or their distance is no criterion for the strength of potentially harmful electromagnetic emission. These strict radiation and emission protocols do exist, they must be followed and they aim to ensure that any potential harmful effects are avoided. Therefore, the part of Mr Lukanić’s statement in which he says that the system is unregulated is not true. Tomislav Lukanić, a Croatian candidate for the European Parliament has made a claim based on unsubstantiated research files which do not disapprove of the implementation of 5G technology. Most of those research files are very outdated or do not even directly correlate with 5G network technology. Furthermore, the stated number of research files is not correct. The numerical aspect of the statement regarding scientists signees of the appeal is valid. However, the criteria for their selection are not completely clarified. The claim that the system is unregulated when it comes to 5G technologies is also untrue. In conclusion, we assess that Mr Lukanić’s full statement, that consists of multiple claims about 5G technology, is altogether mostly false.

German right-wing politicans like Alice Weidel of the right-wing populist party AfD says ‘yes’. The criminal statistics seem to support this claim but the number of suspected criminals is small in all population groups. This quote is an excerpt of a Facebook post Alice Weidel published on 25 March 2019. She is co-chair of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), a right-wing populist party in Germany with extreme right-wing tendencies. In this Facebook post, she refers to an article of the public broadcaster Südwestrundfunk (SWR) which in turn refers to the security report of the state of Baden-Württemberg “Sicherheit 2018”. This is the second annual report published since 2017 by the Ministry of the Interior, Digitisation and Migration of Baden-Württemberg in cooperation with the Criminal Police Office of this state. According to the safety report, a total of 23,332 offences of aggression were recorded in public space in Baden-Württemberg in 2018. Such offences are defined as “crimes committed with the use or threat of physical violence”. Of these acts of aggression, 14,314 were committed by Germans, 9,018 by non-Germans and 2,578 by asylum seekers or refugees. Measured against the total number of cases, the number of refugees suspected of having committed an offence corresponds to about 11% – a rise from 3% or 6% a couple of years earlier. But to check whether they are over-represented, one has to look beyond these numbers.    Offences against sexual self-determinationInfogram The last number of refugees registered by the Federal Statistical Office in Baden-Württemberg was 194,120 (source: Federal Statistical Office). Assuming this number of inhabitants, regardless of immigration and emigration in any form and time and calculating the respective proportion of recorded aggression offences for the year 2018, about 1.3% of all refugees living in Baden-Württemberg would have been suspects in aggression offences. In order to compare this quota with the “remaining” population, the total number of inhabitants of Baden-Württemberg minus the refugees or asylum seekers, is calculated to be 10,829,305. The total number of aggression offences committed by German or non-German suspects in the public sphere according to the safety report amounts to 23,332 cases. According to these numbers, about 0.2% of the “remaining” population would have been suspects in aggression offences. The same approach is used to calculate the proportions of the respective population groups in connection with offences against sexual self-determination. The total number of these offences in 2018 amounted to 7,607 cases. German or non-German suspects were 5,326 of them, the number of suspected refugees or asylum seekers was 708. Measured against the total number of population groups, suspected asylum seekers and refugees account for 0.36%, the rest of suspects 0.05%. The calculations with the figures in the Security Report show that refugees and asylum seekers under suspicion actually account for a higher proportion of recorded offences of aggression and offences against sexual self-determination than the rest of the population. Weidel’s statement is therefore correct. Political actors, such as the AfD in this case, try to establish a firm link between migration and crime from this, “[…] in order to underpin demands for increasingly harsh measures to counter migration”, as the criminal law expert Christian Walburg writes. However, it is difficult to compare two population groups that are so different and differentiated. Among refugees and asylum seekers, there is “[…] as among the population as a whole, a small proportion of the highly burdened, while the vast majority do not commit crimes.” Similarly, Walburg points out, among immigrants there is a particularly large number of young men which are more likely to commit crimes. Alice Weidel from the German right-wing party AfD has tried to establish a link between migration and crime by claiming that refugees and asylum seekers are over-represented as suspects in aggression offences and offences against sexual self-determination. The criminal statistics of the state Baden-Württemberg support Weidel’s claim. However, we rate this claim only as mostly true because it does not account for the fact that the vast majority of refugees and asylum seekers do not commit such crimes.       RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Marcel Posa, Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, DE;https://www.facebook.com/aliceweidel/photos/a.1063313067013261/2434890673188820/?type=3&theater,https://im.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/publikation/did/sicherheitsbericht-2018/?tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bsearch%5d=Kriminal&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5btopics%5d=-1&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bsubmit%5d=1&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bministries%5d=3&cHash=dc7b9ecd0bc75a91e3541f139c355064,https://infogram.com/7fa8ffc7-89f7-4812-a16a-61336b7e10ab,https://infogram.com,https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Migration-Integration/Tabellen/schutzsuchende-bundeslaender.html,http://www.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/innere-sicherheit/272522/migration-und-kriminalitaet,https://www.instagram.com/;“Asylum seekers and refugees are clearly over-represented in both sexual assaults and aggression offences”;;;;;;
182;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-the-eu-yields-1500-2000-euro-to-every-dutchman-annually/;“The EU yields 1500-2000 euro to every Dutchman annually”;2019-04-23;eufactcheck;;It sounds great: 1500 to 2000 euro per year for every Dutch citizen, only because the Netherlands is a member of the European Union. This is what the Dutch progressive liberal party D66 states in a twitter response to a promotional ‘Nexit’ video by extreme right PVV leader Geert Wilders. To good to be true?  “The European Union yields 1500 to 2000 euro to every Dutchman annually.” It seems to be a statement with a long history. In 2012, former D66 party leader Alexander Pechtold claimed this for the first time, in the Dutch television program ‘Buitenhof’. From time to time, the party still uses the statement as an argument in favor of its pro-European Union attitude. For instance, on the 11th of April, 2019, when D66 posted a video including several benefits of European cooperation. The party refers to the CBS (the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics) as the source of its statement. However, CBS does not have any data about Dutch earnings from the EU. CBS does have data about remittance of all member states of the European Union. Mistake CBS being referred to as a source, seems to be a mistake. When several twitter users ask for factual explanation, the party refers to a CPB report (the Dutch Central Plan Bureau) about profits from the introduction of the euro. Not CBS. The report by the CPB is from 2014, and was written as a result of claims made in the book ‘Europa in Crisis’, by Coenraad Teulings, the CPB-president at the time. The report refers to the internal market analysis that the CPB carried out in 2008. In the report, it is noted that the total Dutch export of goods is 18 percent higher than it would be without an internal market. The effect of increased trade on the GDP was subsequently estimated. It is estimated that the GDP has increased between 4 to 6 percent. This means an income increase of 1500-2200 euros per year for an average income. However, the CPB places a large disclaimer on this data, as it is unknown as how the economy would have developed if there hadn’t been a common European market. Membership fee Of course, The Netherlands have to pay a membership fee to the European Union. This sum partly consists of VAT (value added tax) and a sum that is based on the height of the GNI (Gross National Income). The Netherlands also receive funds from the EU. For example: to carry out the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2017, the Dutch remittance to the EU was an estimated 6,9 billion euros. The Netherlands received 3,7 billion from the EU. All in all, it can be concluded that every Dutch citizen has to pay 187,35 euros to be a member of the European Union in 2017. If we subtract that last amount from the estimated income increase of an average income, the result is quite close to the 1500-2200 euros that the EU would bring all Dutch citizens per year, according to D66. However, there is a large number of ‘ifs and buts’ to this story. D66 claims that every Dutch citizen will receive an extra 1500-2000 euros per year, thanks to the EU. But this is not correct, since this only applies to average incomes. Moreover, the estimations by the CPB (like mentioned before) are not completely reliable, because we do not know how the economy would have developed without a common European market. In addition, the most recent data about EU earnings are from 2008. Since only this relatively old investigation has been used, it is unclear these data are still up-to-date. Conclusion   So, does the EU yield 1500 to 2000 euros to every Dutch citizen each year? If taken into consideration that the data that are used are from 2008, the statement made by D66 is mainly correct. However, we have to make too many reservations, which makes the statement uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

183;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-2018-youth-unemployment-in-sweden-is-the-lowest-in-17-years/;“2018 youth unemployment in Sweden is the lowest in 17 years”;2019-04-19;eufactcheck;;Peter Rangwe, who is a free time politician, representing the political party Socialdemokraterna (the Swedish social democratic party) claims that the figures on youth unemployment 2018 in Sweden is the lowest in 17 years. Socialdemokraterna is the now reigning party. He also claims that Sweden received economical support by the EU in 2014, to cope with the problems that the youth unemployment created in  Swedish society. Rangwe claims this on his Facebook page after a meeting with the Swedish Ministry of Employment, Ylva Johansson, in January earlier this year. The post never reveals where these figures come from. Fact checking process After contacting Rangwe to check where he has gotten these figures from, he states reliable sources but the figures the sources give do not match the figures Rangwe has given on his Facebook page. This leaves us with the problem that Rangwe claims that the figures on youth unemployment 2018 in Sweden is the lowest in 17 years. According to the sources he gave us it is the lowest in 15 years, if counting from when he wrote the Facebook post. We do not know if Rangwe is aware of this, because after we began question his claim, he sent us links to support his claim (which did not support his claim) and after that he stopped responding to us. This is problematic because if he knows he is wrong he has chosen to not correct this misinformation. Rangwe has always stated the Swedish Ministry of Employment as his number one source. We do not know if his figures (17) comes from the Ministry, but if it does, he has chosen to not check if her figures are correct and just passed them on to the public. Another problem is that when we have searched for sources that supports Rangwe’s claim, we have found other reliable sources that states other information on youth unemployment in Sweden 2018. Both Rangwe’s and our sources are government agencies, that are financed by the Swedish government. Our main source is Statistiska Centralbyrån (SCB), which is an agency that supply users and customers with statistics for decision making, debate and research. Rangwe’s main source is the Swedish Ministry of Employment and the website of the Swedish government. SCB claims that the figures on youth unemployment in Sweden 2018 were the lowest figures since the first quarter of 2009, which would make it the lowest figures in 10 years. The Swedish government claims on their website that the figures on youth unemployment in Sweden 2018 was the lowest figures since 2003, which would make it the lowest figures in 15 years. Once again this is a problem because the figures Rangwe wrote in his Facebook post is not valid by any source. Another problem is that different government agencies state different figures for the same matter. Which could be a consequence of how they have counted and construed the results of who an unemployed youth is. It could also be that the government writes that 2003 had the earlier lowest figures because it was the same political party that had the power in 2003 as in 2018 and now. SCB claims that the earlier lowest figures were in 2009 when four different political parties ruled together, without Socialdemokraterna. Relevant or not Rangwe also claims that Sweden received economical support by the EU in 2014, to cope with the problems that the youth unemployment created in the Swedish society. This claim is true, but we cannot see why this is relevant to his statement. In September 2014, Socialdemokraterna won the elections against previously mentioned parties. During this time the figures on youth unemployment were so high that the EU decided to give Sweden economical support to correct the problem. The decision to support Sweden was taken in 2013, and the support came in 2014 and 2015. Which means that it was Socialdemokraterna that received the money, not their opposition who ruled between 2006 and 2014. The only reason we could find to why he felt he needed to mention this information, is because he wants to make it seem like Socialdemokraterna makes a great job creating jobs. Conclusion When we saw the Facebook post of Rangwe we asked ourself where he had gotten these figures from? Therefore we contacted him and asked for his source while we began our own research. We found the information we were looking for, but quickly realized the sources stated different figures. After looking into this we have come to the conclusion that the government agencies that had different data results must have compiled the figures differently, therefore the different result. However, we think that SCB is the more reliable source, because their only purpose is to present different types of figures, data and statistics like this. Therefore, we conclude that the statement that youth unemployment in Sweden in 2018 is the lowest in 17 year is mostly false.

The claim is mostly true because it complies with its source. However, Rinne forgets to mention the other end of the value range. Every time we do not get a receipt from a purchase, we could be supporting grey economy. The new online buffered cash register system could be the answer, according to the Finnish Ministry of Finance. On 25 March 2019, Antti Rinne, the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, claimed in his electoral tv interview: “Based on the experiences in Sweden, the Finnish Ministry of Finance has estimated that getting online payment terminals would prevent the grey economy from occurring by 140 million euros per year.” Antti Rinne bases his claim on a report by the Finnish Tax Administration. It was commissioned by the Ministry of Finance to research what kind of fiscal register system would work best in Finland. The grey economy, also known as the shadow economy, refers to all work activity and business transactions for which taxes are not payed. The phenomenon is a problem especially in cash based industries, such as construction and restaurant business. A task force of the Finnish Tax Administration proposes the implementation of online fiscal cash register systems in Finland. According to their report, concealing income is a means of shadow economy and results in a lack of tax revenue. At its simplest, it means not registering the purchasing transaction in the cash register system or the accounting. How the suggested system works An online payment terminal is the little machine in which we put our credit card when we buy things. The payment terminals are usually connected to a larger hardware, the cash register system. Now the Finnish Ministry of Finance suggests that connecting the payment terminals to the Internet would allow a more automatic taxation in Finland – hence the term “fiscal”. The fiscal cash register system saves the data in an internal memory, or the buffer. Then the information is sent automatically to the Finnish Tax Administration. The main idea of the buffered online system is to enable purchasing transactions even if the data connection to the Tax Administration has been lost.  The truth with a twist Firstly, we did find the correct numbers in the source so we could say that the claim by Antti Rinne is true. However, Rinne only talked about 140 million euros even if the report mentioned a scale of 120–140 million euros. Secondly, Rinne stated that the estimate came from the Finnish Ministry of Finance. Technically, this is not true because the report was executed by the Finnish Tax Administration. The Ministry of Finance commissioned it. Ultimately, even though the statement was technically correct, Antti Rinne did not take into account the costs of implementing such systems that were also presented in the report. Janne Marttinen, the Head of Grey Economy Information Unit of the Finnish Tax Administration, confirms that the number that Rinne has presented does comply with the estimations that the Tax Administration has made based on the experiences among Finnish and Swedish companies. Also costs involved Even if Rinne did not comment the net impact of the planned reform on the public economy, we wanted to find out whether it would bring considerable costs.  According to the report by the Finnish Tax Administration, it would cost 24 million euros to the Tax Administration to establish the system. The annual growth of tax revenue can be expected to increase by 120–140 million euros a year. For comparison, Finland gets 157,5 million euros as EU income support and market support every year.  The reform would apply to between 40 000 and 170 000 companies depending on the scale. To companies this would require upgrades in cash register systems or new acquisitions of hardware.  Marttinen says that most of the expenses are nonrecurring costs and would not have been avoidable anyway. The digitalisation of the financial management of companies, where information is in structural form, would bring massive gains for companies. According to Marttinen, yearly operating costs would not change much for the companies. Acquisition costs are tax-deductible. After Finnish Parliamentary election 14 April 2019, the country is waiting for a new government to be formed. It remains uncertain how the new government will respond to the suggestion on the cash register system reform. The law is in the preparation phase. Antti Rinne is the person who will lead the effort to form a new government. We found the correct numbers that Antti Rinne used in his statement from an official source and they are backed by Janne Marttinen, the Head of the Gray Economy Information Unit of the Finnish Tax Administration. However, Rinne did not mention that the estimate proposed in the report was not a simple figure but a scale, nor did he take into account the cost of the implementation of the new system. Despite the imprecise citation of the source, we think this claim is mostly true.Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

More specifically, the news item was titled “The deadline for submitting applications to participate in the European elections for Greek citizens who live in another EU country expires today”. The item was chosen due to its importance for the Greek voters who live in other EU countries and the forthcoming European elections. The publication of “Avgi”- which can be found here: http://www.avgi.gr/article/10813/9721606/legei-semera-e-prothesmia-ypobole-aiteseon-ellenon-katoikon-ee-gia-symmetoche-stis-euroekloges- initially states: ” Greeks citizens who have their residence in another EU member state can submit their application until today Thursday in order to vote at the upcoming European elections in the cities of the EU member state where they reside permanently or happen to be on the day of the vote”. However, the publication time and date of the news item appear  as follows: Publication: Friday, March 29, 2019, 08:34. The non-matching of the two dates therefore makes the publication problematic. When did the deadline expire,  on Thursday or on Friday? The news item refers to the Ministry of Interior, which describes in detail the procedure the interested voters need to follow in order to submit their application. More specifically, a link is given, which refers to the website of the Ministry, where one could complete the application. After researching (Wednesday, April 10, 2019) the specific news item on other news websites on the Internet, we find the following: 1. Over 20 websites (avgi.gr, Olympia.gr, businessnews.gr, altsantiri.gr, pentapostagma.gr, etc.) published the news item regarding the “deadline for submitting applications to participate in the European elections for Greek citizens who live in another EU country” with almost the same content and a similar title, on Friday, March 29, 2019. Neither the name of a journalist nor a relative source appear on the news items. 2. However, at least 15 sites (amna.gr, kathimerini.gr, e-synews.gr, iefimerida.gr, enikos.gr, etc.) published on Friday, March 29, 2019, the news item with a completely different title and content. According to the specific sites, the applications were prolonged until April 5, 2019. None of the specific sites, except for the APE-MPE, quotes the name of the journalist or a relevant source. In particular, the publication of the Athenian-Macedonian News Agency, APE-MPE stated: the deadline for registering in the special electoral lists in order to vote in the European elections for Greek citizens who live in another EU country is extended until 5 April 2019. Applications can be submitted to the Ministry of Interior website (www.ypes.gr) and to the relevant Greek ambassadors and consular authorities in the member states of the European Union. Greek EU residents will vote in polling stations to be set up in some cities in their country of residence. It is noted that especially for Greek voters residing in the United Kingdom, the deadline has already been extended until 10 April (https://www.amna.gr/home/article/347466/Paratasi-stis-aitiseis-Ellinon-katoikon-tis-EE-gia-summetochi-stis-euroekloges). 3. It is worth noting that only one website, namely topontiki.gr, has published twice the news item with a different title and content (expiration and extension of the deadline for submitting statements). However, it is not obvious which news item preceded the other. Finally, following the publication of the two different news items, a research was carried out on Wednesday (April 10th, 2019) on the website of the Ministry of Interior, aiming at finding the press release on the expiration or the extension of the date for the submission of relevant applications. A press release was indeed found, which was entitled “Extending the date for the submission of applications for the 2019 European Elections by Greek EU residents” and which was published on Friday, March 29th 2019 (http://www.ypes.gr/el/MediaCenter/Minister/PressReleases/?id=6066fd72-8b2d-4b2f-9658-ace2e3d96d25&fbclid=IwAR1u57UMaTnpxAYwxrnmBlbCelV5xL_HGypyMKreVBV0iGQVVpJb2He2cx8).  It is worth mentioning that a search was conducted in order to locate an equivalent earlier press release (January 2019 research) regarding the deadline for the submission of applications by Greek EU residents for participation in the European elections, but without any result. In a further research carried out on the website of the Ministry of Interior, and in particular on the tabulations: Elections, Elections for the European Parliament, Interested Greek residents abroad, it was found out that the Ministry of Interior had initially ruled that the deadline for the submission of the applications was March 29, 2019. However, the publication date of the specific publication does not appear. (http://www.ypes.gr/el/Elections/ElectionsEuropeanParliament/ElectionsforEuropeanParliament/InterstGreeksAbroad/) Therefore, the news item from the website of the newspaper “Aygi” proved to be partially- mostly true, following our verification procedure. The news item was based on the original date set by the Interior Ministry. However, it became apparent that no further investigative research was carried out on the day of the deadline for a possible date change or extension. This news item, coupled with the incorrect mention of the expiration date (“Today Thursday is the last day…”), is misleading as regards the timing of the submission of applications by Greek voters living in EU countries. More specifically, it leads the voters to the wrong conclusions, due to the wrong time frame. Finally, it is worth noting that the process followed for recovering the volume of articles audited and recovering data from the source was not difficult.

The statement raised the question what the source is for Mrs Borzan’s statement and to what extent this is or is not true.  We examined existing studies of EU legislation, documents of the European Parliament, contacted the Croatian Parliament, talked to Croatian experts on European legislation and contacted Mrs Borzan’s office in order to verify the fact in this statement. We found that the number in this statement is mostly true. However, the exact number is difficult to confirm. This numerical assessment is predominantly based on estimations of experts who emphasized that it would be very demanding for any researcher to find out the exact number. Also, the main source that Mrs Borzan mentioned in our correspondence was an analysis by a British eurosceptic campaign group on the basis of which she made a correlation between the UK and Croatia. Mrs Biljana Borzan, a current Croatian member of the European Parliament, who is also a candidate in the upcoming European elections, said for a regional TV network N1: I hope that more Croatians will vote in the upcoming elections because two thirds (2/3) of the laws that are having an effect on Croatia’s legislation are being implemented by European Parliament. For that reason I hope that interest in the upcoming elections will be higher than 25 percent in the previous elections. The focus of our research is to find if the 2/3 of the European laws are being implemented in the Croatian legislation. The European legislation possesses the power or the ability by which the European Union implements its regulations into the legislation system of its members. While in the process of joining in the European Union, countries must sign a contract in which they allow the implementation of European laws in their legislation system. Regulations bring changes in different aspects of citizens’ lives and for that reason it is very important to consider this topic as a relevant one. First we contacted Mrs Biljana Borzan via email to check the source for her statement. Mrs Borzan quickly justifies it by a research conducted by so-called Business for Britain, a eurosceptic campaign group in the UK founded in year 2013 by five hundred UK business leaders. This study is unavailable in the pdf at the time of our research but its main points are available on the website Talk Business. According to the analysis, EU rules account for 65 percent of UK laws. This research contains the same statistics Mrs Borzan stated, but the difference is that the research is based on the United Kingdom’s legislation and not on Croatia’s legislation. When asked why she thinks findings on British legislation could apply to Croatia, she says in her email: “This research is relevant for the Republic of Croatia given that these two members of the European Union are not a part of the Eurozone or the Schengen zone.” Each country has its own legislation system regulated by their own criteria and each system is differently conceived. It is difficult to assess to what extent the legislation system of the United Kingdom and Croatia legislation system is comparable because the implementation of European regulations is different for every national legislative system. It is important to note that these statistics were often misused by the Eurosceptics in the UK to prove that decisions about their citizens are made elsewhere, without acknowledging that directives need to be implemented by the British government in the best way they see fit.  Mrs Tamara Ćapeta, an experienced professor at the Department of Public European Law at University of Zagreb says that all EU member states are comparable if you look at how many national policies are tied with European law. She says that probably the main reason Borzan quoted the mentioned research is the fact that “there probably aren’t any other relevant statistics to cite.” Regarding the main question, Professor Ćapeta says it is certainly true that a large number of EU countries’ regulations have a European origin. The exact percentage can vary depending on the regulatory culture in each country. In countries that have a lot of legislative norms even without the EU, the percentage is lower than in the countries with less national regulation.  She says that the exact number is difficult to find out for each country and that this would demand a very through research effort, but that two thirds “may be close to the truth”. EU regulations (a binding legislative act that has to be fully implemented throughout the European Union) and directives (a legislative act that sets out the goal that all states must achieve but each state decides independently on finding a way how to achieve it) are ways in which European laws come into legislation systems of its members. Professor Ćapeta explains that EU regulations are directly incorporated into the legislation system, while directives and implementation of some founding contracts require their incorporation into national laws and not straight into the legislation system.  We contacted the Croatian Parliament in order to find out how many Croatian laws based on European directives have been adopted since the country became an EU member in year 2013. Mrs Tatjana Briški from the Office for International and European Affairs at the Croatian Parliament shared statistics for three years:  In year 2015, 128 laws have been voted for in the Croatian Parliament, out of which 41 of them were based on EU directives In year 2017, 125 laws have been voted for, out of which 50 of them were based on EU directivesIn year 2018, out od 238 laws, 71 were based on EU directives This does not include the mentioned EU regulations that require no legislative activity in the Croatian Parliament, but are applied directly (national transposition). Therefore, it is difficult to measure the exact number. We tried to examine EUR-lex statistics in hope we would find more information, however there was no data available that would help us make clear conclusions without hiring legal and research experts to conduct a serious and lengthy study.  To get an additional expert opinion, we spoke to Hrvoje Špehar, political science professor on the Faculty of Political Science in Zagreb whose research interests are focussed on the European Union. According to Špehar, well-known professors whose work concerns the EU’s political system, like S. Hicks and W. Wessels say that more than 50% of the European laws are being implemented into the member’s legislation system. Špehar also said that the impact of European laws on EU member countries’ laws is difficult to measure and it would demand complicated and thorough research of legal experts, unique for each member state. He pointed out that national regulations are not the same by their importance and size and that they cannot be changed in the same way by the imposed European regulations. Špehar also commented that making such a correlation between the UK and Croatia is almost irrelevant, as the number of  regulations that concern the Eurozone and the Schengen area is not as high to significantly change the amount of EU legislature in each country.  In this blog article, Professor Annette Elisabeth Toeller assessed current research on the Europeanization of public policies and makes many of the points mentioned by the experts we interviewed. She said that looking for these numbers should be done carefully as “all they can do is give us a first, very rough idea of the scope of the European impact on national legislation. Figures make only sense as long as they are differentiated between policy fields.”  On the one hand, the exact number of two thirds cannot be confirmed, however, according to all the experts we spoke to, it is close to the truth as more than 50 percent of Croatian legislation derives from the European regulations and laws. It is important to emphasize that the fact checking of this statement and the exact number would involve a serious research endeavor that is beyond our skills and expertise. Also, as all of our expert interviewees highlighted, this is a very complicated matter because of the nature of EU legislature and then the nature of each EU member country’s legislative system. The impact of EU law is different for each sector.  On the other hand, the research Mrs Borzan quoted is questionable for two reasons. One is that it is not clear to what extent this research is statistically relevant. Second is that the comparison between the legislation systems of Croatia and the UK is an assumption that would also demand a serious and lengthy comparative research inquiry.  To conclude, the current Croatian member of the European Parliament Biljana Borzan made a correlation that is based on an assumption. Even though experts who we interviewed assess that the figures could closely match the extent to which EU laws and regulations affect Croatia’s national legislature, this would demand a lengthy and serious study beyond our expertise.

The National Coalition Party denies the cooperation with United Russia as well as sharing the same ideology, although there are reports of cooperation between the parties in the past. The National Coalition Party (Kokoomus) is a large centre-right political party in Finland. United Russia (Yedinaya Rossiya) is the ruling political party in Russia. The relations between the parties have been discussed in Finland several times before. A Finnish blogger and graphic designer Kasper Strömman posted on 16 February an Instagram picture of Vladimir Putin and Petteri Orpo, the chairman of Finnish National Coalition Party Kokoomus, in front of their political posters. In the picture, the similarity between the graphic design of the slogans behind Putin and Orpo is noticeable. The original publisher, Strömman, is known for posting parodic pictures often related to graphic design. On February 18 Finnish MEP and Vice President of the European Parliament Heidi Hautala reposted Kasper Strömman’s Instagram post of Putin and Orpo and claimed in her tweet that ‘’This conformity can’t be a surprise because the National Coalition Party and United Russia have been fraternal parties for a long time’’. Hautala herself has a long history of representing the Finnish Green Party.  The term “fraternal party” can be defined in several ways. Fraternal parties often share the same political ideology but their views on some topics can differ a lot. We found definitions for the term from Finnish language regulator Kotus and Wikipedia.    When we asked our sources about if the parties are or have ever been fraternal parties, different sources seemed to emphasize different criteria. We decided to categorize these arguments in four sections: cooperation between parties, common ideology, belonging to the same political internationals and party’s own statement on the issue.  The cooperation  We reached out for Hautala and she answered us via email, in which she said that the Strömman’s picture in the tweet was humoristic, but the claim about fraternal parties was not.  Hautala based her statement on several Finnish news articles and editorials published between 2006 and 2014. In those articles there were references to different occasions where the National Coalition Party and United Russia had cooperated in 2006-2011. Hautala also emphasized that she meant to write in past tense in her tweet. She had also tweeted another post where she underlined the ‘’has been’’ -part in her post and clarified that she did not mean that the parties would still cooperate. Different sources, some of which Hautala also referred to, have reported on cooperation between the parties in the past.  According to an article in the National Coalition Party’s online news-service Verkkouutiset, United Russia’s representatives planned to visit the National Coalition Party in Finland in 2006.  The chairman of the National Coalition Party Jyrki Katainen said in the article that the National Coalition Party and United Russia have had a relationship since the chairmanship of Ville Itälä and the National Coalition Party is just about the only party in Finland keeping regular contact with Russian political parties. He also mentioned cooperation plans with European People’s Party group (EPP) and United Russia. “We are aiming to keep up good relations with United Russia. They have a centre-right mindset”, Katainen stated in the article in Verkkouutiset. According to Finnish national broadcasting company Yle, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma, Konstantin Kosachev, who is also one of United Russia’s politicians, said in 2010 that United Russia and National Coalition Party have relations. Russian media has also named United Russia and National Coalition party as ‘’sister parties’’. The National Coalition party said that this was a canard. According to the Administration Manager of the National Coalition Party, Timo Elo, the National Coalition Party has once organized a seminar for some of their operators about party activities in Western democracy. They also discussed about developing the relations between Finland and Russia.  The National Coalition party is not the only Finnish political party which has connections with United Russia. The Centre party of Finland has also cooperated with United Russia. Ilta-Sanomat published the text of a cooperation contract between the two parties back in 2009, though the Centre party said it was never signed.  The ideologies Despite Katainen’s 2006 claim that United Russia and the National Coalition Party shared some common values, already in 2011 an influential member of his party had a different tone. According to a news story by the Finnish news agency STT, the National Coalition Party politician Ilkka Kanerva visited United Russia’s party congress in 2011. At that time, Kanerva said to Ilta-Sanomat that United Russia and the National Coalition Party do not share the same ideological base. It is noteworthy that the public image of Putin and his party has changed a lot in the Western world during the past two decades, and having relations with them was not always regarded as politically toxic. Tuomas Forsberg, Professor of International Relations at the University of Tampere, says the global change in attitudes happened somewhere between the years 2005 and 2006, at the beginning of Putin’s second presidential term. “There were several incidents like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya (a Russian journalist critical of Putin and the wars in Chechnya), and an authoritarian trend. In Europe, attitudes towards Putin changed well before the Georgian War of 2008.”  These trends, however, did not prevent the National Coalition Party from maintaining relations with United Russia in 2006 and 2011. One way to determine if the two parties could be characterized as fraternal parties is to look at their stances on various issues. On these grounds, Markku Jokisipilä, the Director of the Centre for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, says Hautala’s comparison sounds rather peculiar. “United Russia is a nationalist, illiberal party that is closely connected to Putin’s authoritarian administration. Despite its name, the National Coalition Party is a socially liberal, European movement.” According to Jokisipilä, unlike the various social democratic parties across Europe, United Russia and the National Coalition Party do not come from the same ideological family. Hautala’s characterization is, in his words, ”far-fetched.” Political internationals and The National Coalition party’s own statement The National Coalition Party has claimed that they have not officially cooperated with United Russia and do not consider the party their fraternal party. It counts the parties that are members of the same political internationals as their fraternal parties.  “Our fraternal parties are members of The European People’s Party group (EPP) or  International Democrat Union (IDU). United Russia isn’t part of them. We don’t cooperate and United Russia has never been our fraternal party”, says Matilda af Hällström, the Head of International Affairs of the National Coalition Party.  Despite the fact that there has been some cooperation between the National Coalition Party and United Russia in the past, the National Coalition Party states that United Russia has never been their fraternal party and also their ideologies differ. The term “fraternal party” can also be defined in several ways. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if United Russia and the National Coalition Party have ever been fraternal parties. Because there are different definitions to this case and we couldn’t prove just one of them right, we came to the solution that this fact is uncheckable.

In the popular Dutch talkshow Jinek she said that a quarter of all Turkish judges have been discharged already. In her capacity as rapporteur Piri investigates if Turkey meets the preconditions for EU-membership and if the country lives up to the agreements made with the EU so far. Her findings are presented in a yearly Turkey monitor. In 2018 the outcomes of her investigation even made her press the EU to suspend the accessions talks. In her opinion, talks with Turkey are pointless under conditions of disproportional repressive measures and an obvious move away from European values. At the same time Piri was denied access to the country, most likely due to her critical stance, since the attempted military coup. Kati Piri talks about human rights violations in the Dutch talkshow Jinek. At the talkshow table, Eva Jinek asked Piri about the obstacles for EU-membership of one of Europe’s southern border states. She mentioned that the human right situation is the major issue in Turkey. She gave several examples: ‘A quarter of all judges have been discharged already (…). Turkey is still a country with most journalists imprisoned.’ This last issue has been debated and criticized many times. But what about the judiciary? Independent judiciary at stakeIn her 2018-report Piri gives numbers for the amount of discharged judges since the state of emergency, shortly after the 2016 attempted coup. In total 152.000 civic employees, such as teachers, medical doctors, academics and judges have been laid down, according to Piri. It proved difficult to single out the exact number of judges based on this report. Asked for her source Piri mentioned the European Commission’s Turkey-report. The EC-report states that ‘there has been serious backsliding and the independence of the Turkish judiciary was severely undermined following, among other issues, the dismissal and forced removal of 30% of Turkish judges and prosecutors following the 2016 attempted coup.’ The report also gives exact numbers: ‘In total, since the attempted coup, 4 399 judges and prosecutors have been dismissed from their positions of which 454 were later reinstated to their positions by the CJP (Council of Judges and Prosecutors). There are currently over 4 000 judges and prosecutors against whom legal action has been taken (dismissals or suspension).’ Given these numbers the statement by Piri is mostly true. However at first 30% of all judges and prosecutors were discharged, about 5% was reinstalled bringing the total amount to a quarter. But….Piri could have been more precise by including the prosecutors in her statement, it is clear that she talks about the judiciary as a whole, but prosecutors and judges are by far not the same!

The article is based on a study from the German think tank CEP (Centre for European Policy) in which they researched whether the inhabitants of 8 Euro countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) have more money to spend now than before the euro was introduced as a currency. The original article shows us the following results:  The claim can be considered mostly false. The study shows “winners and losers” after 20 years of the euro. Some countries have seen a rise in prosperity per inhabitant while others have seen a (dramatic) reduction in prosperity per capita. The research conducted by CEP was considerably criticised by other academics. Liberal colour The study on which the article is based is of a strong neoliberal think tank. The chairman of the CEP (PROF. DR. LÜDER GERKEN ) is also chairman of the Friedrich-August-von-Hayek-Stiftung. Friedrich Hayek is a well-known political philosopher and economist of the twentieth century. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern day neoliberalism. Moreover, the German press also says that the CEP is considered quite liberal. As stated in the first lines of this article by Anja Ettel and Holger Zshäpitz from the German medium Die Welt: “The Freiburg Center for European Policy, CEP in short, a think tank known for their strict ordoliberal standpoint, has conducted research on the balance of the euro for every memberstate”. The way the research was conducted Their way of researching is not really waterproof. They work with control countries outside the euro zone and then compare the evolution of the GDPs with their corresponding eurozone countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain respectively. But Eurostat didn’t publish data on the GDP of the euro countries before 2009, yet the study says that they start comparing the euro countries with their control countries from the moment the euro was introduced which was way before 2009 and the researchers do not explain in their study how they might have gotten the data for the GDPs of the countries from any other source either. Eurostat probably has data on the GDP of each euro country from before 2009, but it was not published on their website when we checked. The study explains that the loss (or gain) of prosperity was calculated by assigning each of the 8 euro countries surveyed a number of control countries that had roughly the same evolution in GDP up to the point at which the euro was introduced. Then, on the basis of the evolution of the GDP of these control countries, it was calculated what the GDP of the euro countries could have been if they had not started using the euro as a currency. That way they could see whether the inhabitants of the euro countries would be “richer” or “poorer” without the euro. The problem here is the following: the control countries must meet a number of requirements, one of which is: “only countries that have not been affected by major country-specific shocks during the whole of the relevant period – 1980 to 2017 – can be considered as such shocks may distort the results”, according to the study. However, it never defines what such a “shock” is. Inadequate methodology This problem was also mentioned in the press. According to this opinion piece, by Marcel Fratzscher, member of the German institute for Economic Research (DIW). He considers the results of the study “not reliable” because the methodology is not suitable for the research. “The euro is not responsible for the debt crisis in Europe, but the mistakes of national governments”, he says. This remark by Marcel Fratzscher could mean that the way that the governments of each euro country choose to spend their budget has a bigger impact on the prosperity of said countries than the introduction of the euro itself. The article itself does not say that the euro is responsible for the debt crisis in the EU, but it can be interpreted as such, which would be incorrect according to Marcel Fratzscher. Even the president of the Munich Ifo Institute, Clemens Fuest, does not believe in the comparisons. The EU Commission also criticised the approach of the study. “A good analytical work and a robust methodology are a must to assess the causes of different policies and the development of the gross domestic product of a country”, said a spokesman for the Commission in Berlin. “The weak methodology of the CEP study is far from providing such solid analysis”, he added. Opinion of an expert: Paul De Grauwe We presented our factcheck to Paul De Grauwe, professor at KU Leuven and professor at the London School of Economics. He claimed that the journalist wrongly interpreted the study and therefore the title and the content of the article are false. “The Belgian has not become poorer since 1999 when the euro was introduced. The authors of this study concluded that Belgium’s per capita income has risen less rapidly than in this group of countries. There is a real difference between the control countries and Belgium’s per capita income of €6.370. But that doesn’t mean that the average Belgian citizen has become €6.370 poorer”, said De Grauwe. “On the contrary, according to The European Commission’s statistics (AMECO), the GDP per capita of Belgium rose from €29.300 in 1999 to €35.300 in 2018 (after adjustment for inflation), a real increase of €6.000,” concludes professor De Grauwe. Conclusion The opinions of experts like Marcel Fratzscher and Paul De Grauwe prove that multiple interpretations of CEP’s research are possible. The study itself was conducted correctly, but the interpretation of the study results by “Het Laatste Nieuws” was wrong. The Belgian citizen did not become poorer. Moreover Marcel Fratzscher’s opinion raises the question whether the introduction of the euro itself is the cause of these study results or whether it is more likely because of the way countries spend their budgets. We can assume that most of this claim is false. We didn’t find similar studies or numbers of other organisations.;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fplus189459993%2FEuro-Steht-Deutschland-wirklich-besser-da-als-mit-der-D-Mark.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0ThdwhuiP4aUUkPPiJLM7Faoe1RPtpVIJvodYYmkZZ9RBH6xT7mDpOS28&h=AT2CXCRpsOSaEImrCopPL2PxCi86kQ1kzX6QCpjGfhgQ7gXya4bw2DTElHXaEXXbhOHlxExZJ5Lv7ceY1j-geJf5AHvc2jGeymEzNBeuC2RYshPMiJs3_Fe-hbUp9dvea_u9FTBMmorNiaoHWFj3pA,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tagesspiegel.de%2Fpolitik%2Fstudie-zur-gemeinschaftswaehrung-der-euro-hat-italiener-und-franzosen-aermer-gemacht%2F24028036.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0CLQRU3PhpynoJ36D1WPA-jax2FCAYzqcbb7Stedp9u20me5Ckk5TJNbc&h=AT3yUKWuGSYyXBBIzm6-qYZGit-rtf9lsAlEizOTJ87BNk6Y8m6EZi0-klkilksXxe-zKBW5rOLDLOo5S3lDnygRx7e2RjdOx0IHstJMEIdhzIYuoqV2_xmlkaAzw_OtBjkjdA,https://www.instagram.com/;“The Dutch have become considerably richer because of the euro, Belgians have become poorer”;;;;;;

An additional tweet linked to an article published by the Finnish national broadcasting company YLE concerning the subject. Niinistö also claimed that the presumed decline should be studied more also in Finland and that the four major insect tracking programs in Finland are poorly funded. Niinistö estimated the budget to tens of thousands of euros.    Tweet by Finnish Member of Parliament Ville Niinistö.  The YLE article which Niinistö posted on Twitter covers a study published in the January 2019 issue of Biological Conservation. YLE says that the results of the study show that on a global scale the overall biomass of insects is shrinking at an annual rate of 2,5%. However, the results may have also been interpreted too broadly according to critics. According to the Finnish nature magazine Suomen Luonto, the study has been interpreted falsely in the media and the main author Francisco Sánchez-Bayo went too far in his comments to the British newspaper The Guardian. The article in The Guardian was referred widely in the Finnish media. Suomen Luonto says that the main problem of the insect decline study is that it only focuses on the already declining populations while leaving the stable and growing populations out. The study is based on 73 historical reports of insect declines around the globe, focusing mainly on Europe and North America. It shows that many populations have declined massively, particularly in Europe and Puerto Rico. However, the study clearly points out that the extent of the losses cannot be accurately quantified worldwide due to a lack of historical knowledge in large areas of the world such as Australia, China, sub-tropical and tropical countries. While the Biological Conservation study can be criticized on many points it clearly shows that decline in insect populations can disrupt the proper functioning of multiple ecosystems. According to the study, insects provide pollination, natural pest control, food resources and decomposition services among other functions. The decline also has a major impact on entire ecosystems as insects are the base of many complex food webs. And even if some of the declining species could be replaced with the growing populations, the overall biomass of the declining species could be too big to be compensated. Finnish experts agree on the seriousness of the decline All the Finnish insect experts whom were interviewed for this fact check seemed to agree on the seriousness of the declining insect populations and the effects of the decline on entire ecosystems. There are inadequacies in the Finnish insect tracking projects according to the experts. The tracking of many populations is currently based on volunteer work and is under constant threat of diminishing resources due to the lack of funding at the government level. According to the researchers coordinating the major insect tracking programs, the funding of the programs is indeed at the level Niinistö estimated. We managed to contact three of the four program leaders who estimated their budgets from around 2600 euros per year to around 60 thousand euros per year. Reima Leinonen, Environmental Expert for the ELY Centre of Kainuu (A regional agency for economic development, transport and nature), said that decline in insect populations is indeed a large problem. The tracking network of populations is also difficult to manage due to the inefficient funding. Juha Pöyry, Senior researcher at Finnish Environment Institute SYKE, runs the tracking of moths in Finland. He commented on the importance of insects on a larger scale: “Insects are at the core of many food chains: they feed on various plants and provide food resources for multiple species. For example, many birds are insectivorous and their populations have declined quite steeply, which suggests that there are problems in their food supply.” Jani Järvi, Senior Curator of the Finnish Museum of Natural History’s entomology team, is in total agreement with Pöyry and Leinonen. He adds that along with pollination, insects are fundamental in retaining soil fertility and preventing pests biologically. “The value of biological pest control by insects is estimated to be 5.2 billion dollars a year.” The problem is not alarming only in Finland. It is a global problem. We contacted Elsa Youngsteadt, Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University, by e-mail. According to her more research needs to be done to assess the status of most species as the information is not currently available. “More work is needed to understand how widespread these [local] declines are, and especially what their causes are.” The future is at least a bit brighter. Finnish Environment Institute reported in late February 2019 that the new EU project, ABLE (Assessing Butterflies in Europe), is in the works. The project is being funded by the EU for an initial period of two years. Its main purpose is to expand the tracking of butterflies in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and to assess the health of the environment. The objective is to start tracking in at least eight new EU countries. All the data gathered will be sent to a common database. From there, the data will be available for use by all researchers. There is scientific evidence on the severity of insect decline as an environmental risk. On the global scale there is not enough data to assess the extent and probability of insect decline.

The statement raised the question whether Kolakušić, being an active judge, has the right to do so. We examined national and EU laws and regulations on political participation of judges which could apply to this situation. Even though we found it is true that a Croatian judge can stand as a candidate at the European Elections, what we also discovered are serious contradictions which are yet to unravel. On the 3rd of March a Commercial court judge Mislav Kolakušić made an appearance in one of Croatia’s most watched TV programmes on Croatian public television, an hour-long political talk show called “Nedjeljom u 2” where he announced he will be standing as a candidate in the upcoming European Elections.  In the interview, Kolakušić said:  “The Republic of Croatia European Parliamentary Elections Act enables judges, state attorneys, ombudsman and all other state officials to stand as candidates in the European elections (…). So, of course that is in contradiction with what everybody is saying, because no high state official in Croatia ever reads any laws.” Kolakušić is previously known to Croatian public for his many public appearances, mostly connected to his anti-corruption campaign and initiative called Anticorruption, Given that judge Kolakušić is convinced that he has a right to stand as candidate although he is a judge, we decided to fact check national and EU laws to determine whether he was right. In his statement, Kolakušić is referring to The Republic of Croatia European Parliamentary Elections Act, Article 10.NN 23/13 which says that “The duty of member of the European Parliament shall not be simultaneously compatible with the position of: (…) a judge” along with many other public positions.  It is clearly stated in this article that anyone from the mentioned categories is eligible to run for membership in EU parliament, but that their primary duty “shall cease as at the date of commencement of their term in the European Parliament.” Therefore, according to this, what Kolakušić said is true. However, in one Croatian national law, in the Judiciary Act, Article 90.NN 28/13 says that “A judge must not be a member of a political party, nor be involved in political activity.” So based on this, he shouldn’t be running for any parliament, no matter if he is a party or independent candidate. Also, Article 91 of the same law says that “A judge must not use his/her judicial position or dignity in pursuance of his/her rights.” It remains dubious whether Kolakušić used his judicial dignity and recognition to support the announcement of his candidacy for European Parliament elections, but also when he launched the mentioned “Anticorruption” campaign in October 2018. The question that should now be asked is which of these two laws has the “final verdict” for this judge. Kolakušić stated that if he was elected in EU parliament he would resign at his judicial position, according to the European Parliamentary Elections Act.  According to the principle of primacy of European Union law, in case of contradiction between national an EU laws, the latter prevails. Although the EU law has the principle of primacy regarding EU elections, the Croatian law still applies to Croatia and its courts. That is why it is important to examine the consequences of judge Kolakušić’s candidacy within the Croatian law system. The Judiciary Act does not specify what “political activity” means, but Mr Damir Kontrec, vice president of the National Election Commission and president of the Croatian Judges Association, said for Faktograf.hr that any kind of behaviour that targets voters’ opinions on upcoming European elections, is indeed political activity and is strictly prohibited for Croatian judges. We examined the Report on Judicial Ethics by the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary that says: “In politics, the judge, like any citizen, has the right to have a political opinion. In his reserve, he should simply keep to the judiciary a character such that the individual can have confidence in him, without worrying about the opinions of the judge. A judge cannot behave as an active agent of a political party.” That being said, along with The Republic of Croatia European Parliamentary Elections Act, any judge has the possibility to be on an electoral list, but he/she cannot publicly act as an active representative of the party.  This means that any judge has the right to stand as a candidate in EU elections, but his political promotion and campaign cannot be carried out by him. Someone else should promote his opinions and ideas, while he remains quiet and uninvolved the whole time. Although this is odd, it is the only way this candidacy can be carried out without violating any laws. To conclude, while standing as a candidate at 2019 European Elections is indeed judge Kolakušić’s right, being involved in any kind of pre-election campaign violates Croatian law. It is quite bizarre and uncommon for someone who is a judge and represents the court itself to be violating the Judiciary Act in this manner. The institution that is in charge of dealing with this situation is National Judicial Council. Since official candidacy lists have not yet been published, it is too early to say how the institutions will react, but it is within their power to start disciplinary proceeding. Once the official candidacy lists are published, the National Election Commission will be determining if all candidates have the lawful right to be on the list.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Already, our energy bill is the third most expensive of Europe”;2019-03-26;eufactcheck;;"The political party Groen (the Flemish green party) claims that Belgium is way behind when it comes to green energy. They also say our energy bill is ranked the third most expensive in Europe. Groen mentions this claim on both Facebook and in an article on their website. The party repeats the claim multiple times, but it does not reveal a source. Even though Groen uses the claim for articles on both their website and their Facebook page, they don’t say where this information comes from. After contacting them, they reacted that they used the data from Eurostat to back up their claim. Countries all over the world switch to renewable energy, Belgium stays behind The first part of the claim was the hardest to research. Not a lot of research or data can be found comparing Belgium globally on renewable energy sources. We combined two statistics of Statista, one on global renewable energy and one on the Belgian evolution on renewable energy. From this, we gather that in 9 years, Belgium has grown from 3,6% to 15,8%, while globally we see growth from 5,2% to 11%. It means that Belgium does keep up globally; it even exceeds the average global increase. An expert on the topic, Johan Albrecht, professor of energy at the University of Gent, and an economist explains what Groen might mean with the first part of their claim. “Well, what they mean with this statement is that our country doesn’t achieve the aims made by the European Commission for green energy. Looking at it from that point of view, we are behind on things like investments to make renewable energy possible.” Already, our energy bill is the third most expensive in Europe After researching this topic, it became clear the source of the second part of the claim has to be Eurostat. It is a fact that Belgium is ranked third when it comes to the highest electricity prices. Here is the first red mark in the claim Groen made. The party talks about the energy bill, while it concerns the cost of electricity. “Electricity or power is only a part of the energy. When you take into account fuel or gas, you get a whole different story”, says Albrecht. Another big issue concerning this topic is money. The financial side of renewable energy still rings a lot of alarms. Johan Albrecht claims it is a fact that in the beginning green energy costs a lot, even more than other energy sources. But the long-term point of view is the best one. ‘Which countries have the highest electricity costs? Those who’ve invested most in renewable energy. So, first, we have Denmark, the European leader when it comes to wind energy. Secondly, there is Germany, a country that has a lot of wind and solar energy. And then we have Belgium in the third place. In Belgium, a lot of subsidies go to renewable sources. We can’t forget that the cost of these sources does not get paid by the authorities but needs to get paid by consumers.’ Conclusion “While countries all over the world are switching to green energy, Belgium stays behind. Already, our energy bill is the third of Europe.” It is true that countries all over the world are switching to green energy, but so is Belgium. We don’t have the third highest energy bill, but we do have the third highest electricity bill in Europe. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

193;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-between-25-000-to-30-000-lobbyists-are-working-in-brussels/;„Between 25.000 to 30.000 lobbyists“ are working in Brussels;2019-03-22;eufactcheck;;In an article on the Viennese online news portal, www.vienna.at, Julia Herr, Austrian Social Democratic Party candidate for the European parliament election, was recently quoted, that there were supposedly „between 25.000 to 30.000 lobbyists“ working in Brussels. According to the article, Herr had made this claim on March 5th, 2019 during a discussion on the EU parliament elections. We rate her claim as „mostly true“.  It seems easy at first to get the number of all lobbyists working in Brussels. There is an official register for lobbyists who hold relations with the European Commission and the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union, however, has an „observer“ status, meaning lobbyists influencing members of the Council do not have to register. Exact number of lobbyists unknown The register lists full-time equivalents but no absolute numbers. As for her primary source ,Julia Herr’s spokesperson refers to the German NGO „LobbyControl“, an organization dedicated to being „politically neutral“. LobbyControl claims to be non-profit. In a press statement in January 2019, LobbyControl published the number of „30.000 lobbyists“ working in Brussels. Asked for its source, a LobbyControl board members says that the number stems from Transparency International (TI) and is also based on the EU’s lobby register. LobbyControl is part of the pan-european alliance called „Alliance for Lobbying Transparency and Ethics Regulation“, short ALTER-EU. On its website, the organization once claims  that there are „25.000 to 30.000“, then it is stated however that „15.000 to 25.000“ lobbyists are working in Brussels. Olivier Hoedeman, member of the executive committee, names Transparency International as a primary source as well. An inquiry to TI has not been answered until the publication date. Hoedeman of ALTER-EU explains why in his opinion the higher number is more realistic: ALTER-EU estimates that each of the 11.832 organizations of the lobby register has at least two employees. That would make a total of 23.646 lobbyists. This number roughly corresponds with Julia Herr’s, the Austrian Social Democratic Party candidate’s claim.  Data is hard to get Julia Herr’s claim includes another „fact“: According to her, the entire budget of all lobbyists is „1,15 billion Euros“. As no one precisely knows how many lobbyists are in Brussels, this must be another estimated numbers. We declared this part of the statement as „uncheckable“. We tried to check the the official numbers. Bernhard Schinwald, spokesperson of the Representation Office of the EU Parliament in Vienna, refers to the transparency register. According to which 74 percent of the organizations spend up to 100.000 Euros on lobbying yearly, 24 percent spend between 100.000 and 1.000.000 per year and 2 percent spend over a million Euros. We tried to calculate the numbers according to the transparency register, however, the steps are too complicated to explain them in detail. Julia Herr’s claim that there are „25.000 to 30.000“ lobbyists in Brussels is based on estimated numbers from NGOs LobbyControl and Transparency International. LobbyFacts confirmed the estimated numbers of lobbyists, though they still remain an estimate. Yet, it is a close as you can get to the number – so we declare Herr’s claim „mostly true“.;https://www.vienna.at/podiumsdiskussion-zur-eu-wahl-in-wien-europawahl-als-klimawahl/6119129,http://www.vienna.at,https://www.instagram.com/;„Between 25.000 to 30.000 lobbyists“ are working in Brussels;;;;;;
194;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/optimism-is-mays-duty/;“Optimism is May’s duty”;2019-03-21;eufactcheck;;"At the end of February, British Prime Minister Theresa May posted a video on her Twitter profile containing a number of statements. She talked about increased employment, increased wages and reduced national debt. Research has shown that this is mostly true.  “We have more people at work than ever before.” A first thing Theresa May said, was “we have more people in work than ever before”. The British economy looks positive at the moment. People are at work, wages are rising and the British labour market continues to run. So there seems to be no problem. In addition, unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen. We see that in the graph below. In 2011, 8.1% of the British labour force was unemployed, in 2017 this had dropped to 4.4%. Unemployment in the UK is also low compared to the European Union. Graph: Emma Roose – Source: Eurostat To come back to May’s statement (“we have more people in work than ever before”), you cannot deny that she is right. Last year, 76.1% of the British workforce was employed, the highest employment rate in British history. Graph: Sybren Bruneel – Source: Office for National Statistics Even when we look back in time, there have never been more British people in work than in 2018. To sum up, the unemployment rate is falling and the employment rate is rising. There are actually more British people in work than ever before. So we can conclude that Theresa May’s statement is right. “We have wages growing at their fastest rate for a decade” As a second proposition, Theresa May mentions that today’s wages are growing at their fastest rate for a decade. This statement sounds very positive, but in reality it is a bit different. Graph: Astrid Vlaeminck – Source: Office for National Statistics; in 2015, a new index was drawn up and a new standard of 100 was created. But according to Samuel Tombs, economist to Pantheon Macroeconomics, it will be difficult for the wages to increase even more. “Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don’t lead to spiraling wage growth,” he said. May’s statement is therefore correct when she says that wages have been growing at the fastest pace over the past decade. But when we take inflation into account, this growth is a lot less spectacular than some would like to show. Real wage growth is thus rising less strongly than it appears at first sight. “A debt falling as a share of the economy” Has Britain’s public debt really fallen, as Theresa May claims? From Eurostat data, we see a clear trend from 2007 onwards: public debt is starting to rise sharply. In 2007 the debt was 41.9% of GDP and in 2010 it was 75.6%. We see that the most remarkable increase occurred in the period from 2008-2009 to 2009-2010. During this period, the debt rose from 52.6% of GDP to 69.6% of GDP (“Gov.uk”). Ever since, we see that debts are still rising but much more gradually than before. In 2015 and 2016, we see an absolute peak moment with the national debt at 88.2% of GDP (Eurostat). But in 2017, we see that the national debt gradually starts to decrease by 87.7% of GDP (Eurostat). On the website “Gov.uk” we can read that, last year too, the debts have fallen (85.8% of GDP in 2018 according to “www.ons.gov.uk”) and that this trend will continue, reaching 73% of GDP in 2023-2024. Compared to the peak moment in 2015-2016, this is still a significant decrease. In “De Volkskrant” Frank Kalshoven (economist and columnist) says that Great Britain, with its national debt now close to 90%, is in the danger zone. It is also said that as a result of this, the British treasury no longer has any room to significantly support economic growth in the coming period. But according to current trends, the national debt seems to be reduced. In other words: we see that the debt is still very high and was increasing until a few years ago, but has been stagnating for two years now. However, this stagnation is slow, but May has not lied when she says that the debts have fallen. If we look at the three statements made by Theresa May, we can conclude that we can only nuance the second statement. Because of this, the statements of May are mostly true.";https://twitter.com/theresa_may/status/1100416298851299329,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unempl-r-fc.png,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cpi-fc.png,https://www.instagram.com/;“Optimism is May’s duty”;;;;;;
195;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-increased-homophobia-in-the-netherlands-is-caused-by-uncontrolled-immigration-and-open-borders/;“The increased homophobia in The Netherlands is caused by uncontrolled immigration and open borders”;2019-03-19;eufactcheck;;On March the 4th Dutch leader of the right-wing Forum for Democracy Thierry Baudet reacted to a statement by liberal politician Rob Jetten about homophobia in The Netherlands. Baudet stated on Twitter: ,,Jetten’s anger about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is justified, but he doesn’t see the causes: the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders his own political party D66 in particular stands for.” His claim about the causes for the increased homophobia is false.  In this factcheck we focus on the statement that ‘the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders’ are the causes of the ‘increased’ homo-hate crimes in The Netherlands. It is important to notice that Baudet doesn’t speak of any specific time or place. This is why we assume that he is talking about the general situation in The Netherlands in recent years.  Tweet by Thierry Baudet Baudet reacted to quotes in a lecture by his fellow Member of Parliament Rob Jetten, as reported by national public broadcaster NOS on 4 March. Jetten voiced concern about the emancipation of the LGBTQ-community in the Netherlands. He didn’t mention any increase of homophobia.  Because Baudet’s statement isn’t specified, checking it is difficult. To still be able to check his statement, we used several research reports about the nationality and ethnicity of suspects of homophobic crimes. Besides that, we also checked whether or not homophobia in The Netherlands has really increased.  The Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP) published a LGBTQ-study in November 2018. This study mainly concentrates on the living conditions of homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people in The Netherlands. An important statement reads: ,,Recent studies indicate that the attitude towards LGBTQ-people has become more positive between 2006/2007 and 2016/2017 (Kuyper 2018).” For this, the SCP used data of the Safety Monitor that is published by the Central Bureau of Statistics.  Besides LGBTQ-people feeling more safe throughout the years, they also mentioned having less experiences with homo-hate crimes. To conclude: the statement about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is generally untrue. Bisexuals did mention a slight increase in experiences with homophobic crimes, but Baudet did not specify that. The LGBTQ-study doesn’t mention the ethnicity and social factors of the culprits. The organization MenEngage Europe does mention it in its factsheet about homophobia: ,,Those who are negative about homosexuality are mostly the elderly, the young, religious people and people from ethnical minority groups.” In 2015, the Dutch police published a study about homophobic crimes in The Netherlands. A notable fact: about 60 percent of the reported incidents took place in Amsterdam. The study doesn’t differentiate between non-immigrants and immigrants, but it does look at the nationality and birth country of the suspects. This study proves that 61.8 percent of the suspects has the Dutch nationality. To quote the study: ,,In 16.6 percent of the cases the suspect has the Moroccan nationality (possibly combined with the Dutch nationality). Besides that, 5.5 percent of the suspects has the Turkish nationality and 2.5 percent has the Romanian nationality. The nationalities that are even less frequent aren’t specified. In 11.5 percent of the cases it concerns a nationality that occurs less than four times.” In conclusion: the uncontrolled immigration and open borders are not the main causes of homophobia in The Netherlands. A different study from The Netherlands Institute for Social Research mentions the following: ,,The acceptance of homosexuality can be a sensitive subject for Syrians: less than a fifth fully or partly agrees with gay marriage. About half fully or partly agrees that the homosexuality of a child is problematic.” The study does prove that Syrians who have been in The Netherlands for a longer time have a more open attitude towards homosexuality.  Laurens Buijs from the University of Amsterdam published a study about the same subject in 2009. He proves that 36 percent of the suspects is of Dutch descent and that another 36 percent of the suspects is of Moroccan descent. This study shows that suspects of homo-hate crimes are just as much of Dutch descent as of Moroccan descent. To conclude: homophobic crimes aren’t caused anymore by ethnical minority groups than by people with the Dutch nationality.  Thierry Baudet’s statement about the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders as the cause of the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is false. This is mainly so because homophobia in The Netherlands hasn’t increased at all. Besides that, the studies above prove that the suspects of homophobic hate crimes are mostly people with the Dutch nationality.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

196;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-salvini-my-government-will-repatriate-100000-migrants-per-year/;Salvini;2019-03-13;eufactcheck;;On 26th November 2017, now-Italian Minister of the Interior said: “If elected, the centre-right government must guarantee 100.000 expulsions per year, in order to get half a million irregular migrants back to their countries in five years”. His promise has turned out to be false. The immigration issue in Matteo Salvini’s political campaign  Immigration was one of the most covered issues of Matteo Salvini’s political campaign in early 2018. According to him, setting arrivals by sea to zero and increasing the number of repatriated migrants was a priority for the country’s welfare. Long before becoming Minister of the Interior, Salvini already spotted some essential conditions to achieve his goals. First of all, he said, it was necessary to increase the number of the Identification and Expulsion Centres and to make the management of immigration shelters more transparent. In addition, he said he wanted to build other shelters under UN protection in Libya, to close more bilateral agreements for repatriation, to stop NGO ships’ arrivals to Italy and to change the procedures for refugee status’ recognition or revocation. Also, Matteo Salvini promised several times that he would send back to their countries 100.000 people per year, a number he lowered just a few months after his election. How Salvini’s promises changed through the years  On 26th November 2017, now-Italian Minister of the Interior said: “If elected, the centre-right government must guarantee 100.000 expulsions per year, in order to get half a million irregular migrants back to their countries in five years”. Not much later, on 11th December, he said again he would have asked his allies to sign an agreement on these numbers. But no more than a year later, on 28th September 2018, Salvini said something very different: it would have been easy, he told the press, to send back to their homeland at least 4.000 people per year. Figures published by the Ministry of the Interior show that 2.833 people have been returned to their countries in the first semester of 2018 (1st January – 31st May) while from 1st June to 31st December, under League-5 Stars Movement cabinet, the number has risen to 3.626. Altogether, 6.459 people have been expulsed from Italy in the whole 2018, more than the 4.000 promised in September 2018 but far less than the 100.000 promised in 2017. Furthermore, according to latest data from Eurostat (Eu’s office for statistics) only 16.899 of 530.000 irregulars  have left Italy between 2015 and 2017, while expulsion injunctions amount to 95.910. This means the number of people actually sent away from the country is far less than it should.   Matteo Salvini versus Marco Minniti Lots of comparisons have been made in Italy between Matteo Salvini and the former Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti (Democratic party). The immigration bill signed from Minniti in 2017 led to an expansion of the shelter facilities. In replacement of the four existing Cie (Centres for identification and expulsion) the government created twenty “Cpr”, permanent facilities for repatriation, one for each region. Altogether they can host 1600 people, for a total cost of 19 million euros. The Conte cabinet, in charge from June 2018, approved the so-called “Decreto sicurezza” (Security bill), which expanded the maximal stay in the Cprs from 90 to 180 days. The bill also establishes that, in case of no place available in those facilities, migrants can be detained in the border offices. In addition, it raises the funds stored for repatriation, although they are being invested from the government in a very new way: if the former cabinet wanted to launch a plan to encourage voluntary repatriation, the actual Minister is keen to spend this funds for sending migrants to their countries, whichever the way.  Why repatriating migrants is so hard  There are two different kinds of repatriation: voluntary repatriation and forced repatriation. The UNHCR (United Nations’ High Committee for Refugees) sponsors the first one, encouraging instruments like the geo-and-see, short stays of the refugees in their homeland to consider the safety conditions. A plan of voluntary repatriation was put into effect worldwide in 2015, but it’s still not an option for a lot of migrants due to conflicts in their native countries, which put on place different risks and threats. Apart from UNCHR, there are various non-profit-organizations that deal with repatriating migrants that could be reintegrated in their homelands. These associations usually guarantee a plane ticket and a funding of €2000 to start a business. In Italy, the AVR (Assisted Voluntary Return), financed the assisted return of 270 citizens from Colombia, Ecuador, Perù, Morocco, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal. In 2017, CIES (Centre for Information and Development of Education), CIR (Italian Centre for Refugees) and GUS (Human Solidarity Group) developed three different programs funded by EU and the Ministry of the Interior’s Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, bringing back home almost 300 migrants from different countries in North Africa. Forced repatriation, instead, depends on several laws and bills that tried to regulate its procedure, such as the so-called “Minniti-Orlando” bill on immigration (that includes, among other measures, the increasement of the shelters’ net and the introduction of voluntary work for migrants). Both voluntary and forced repatriations share the same huge problem: they are really expensive (from Euro 3,000 to Euro 5,000 per person, due to charter flights and safety measures), as was iconically shown in 2006, when 29 Tunisian citizens were repatriated at a cost of Euro 115,000 for the Italian government. For the year 2019, the Ministry of the Interior allocated Euro 1.5 million, an amount sufficient to cover just 500 travels. But it’s not only money: time is also a much-needed resource. Talking about arrivals from Tunisia, Matteo Salvini said that we would need 8 years to repatriate the 4,000 migrants illegally landed in Italy. It is to be seen if this statement can be considered an admission of how difficult is the management of this repatriation system in terms of money and time. In conclusion, Matteo Salvini had promised to repatriate 100,000 migrants per year, but in his first six months of government he only sent back 3,626. Therefore, his promise is false.

197;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-sign-eu-petition-to-stop-punishment-of-aid-to-migrants/;“Sign EU-petition to stop punishment of aid to migrants”;2019-03-12;eufactcheck;;Reinier van Lanschot, party leader of the new, pan-European party Volt – and probable new member of the European Parliament – claims on Twitter that migrant aid is punished in several European member states. Subsequently, he asks his followers to sign a European citizen initiative to make an end to this. However, punishment of migrant aid is not regulated by European law. Van Lanschot tweets: “In European member states, citizens can be fined or even be arrested for handing out food, buying train tickets or offering shelter to migrants.” Then he asks his followers to sign a European citizen initiative “to make an end to this”, but it is not prescribed in European legislation how individual member states enforce their migration policy. Prof. dr. John Vervaele, professor of economical and European criminal law at Utrecht University, confirms: “There is indeed no international or European law that imposes criminalisation whatsoever.” According to the Oxford Dictionary, criminalisation means: “The action of turning an activity into a criminal offense by making it illegal.”      In 2002, the Council of the European Union did formulate a directive to restrict illegal immigration. Following the directive, all European member states must take suitable measures against people deliberately helping illegal immigrants to enter or travel within that member state. Also, all member states are expected to penalise people facilitating shelter for illegal immigrants, if they have the purpose to profit from it. The second article of the directive states that European member states may choose for themselves whether or not they will punish people who provide humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants. “There are of course obligations that connect to human trafficking,” Vervaele explains. He adds that some states interpret these obligations in such a way, only just to spite NGO’s that are aiding migrants. According to a 2014-research by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), facilitating shelter to illegal immigrants is penalised in all EU member states, excluding Ireland. 14 countries will only punish is when people profit from it. The other 13 punish facilitating shelter even when the person does not gain from it. In five of these member states dispensations from punishment are in place, included in their national legislation. The petition that Van Lanschot refers to was written by Justice and Peace, a non-profit organisation devoted to human rights. According to the organisation the indistinct nature of the CEU-directive causes problems in practice. “It makes member states capable to keep threatening people. In this way, it works as a way to scare off people who want to help migrants,” a Justice and Peace spokesperson told EUfactcheck. The organisation takes into account the arrest of the mayor of the Italian Riace, just like several people offering aid to refugees in Greece. What Reinier van Lanschot claims about punishing migrant aid in European member  states is only partly true. Less than half of all member states actually penalise citizens for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Moreover, Van Lanschot is not being precise in referring to all migrants when it only applies to illegal immigrants. What makes this claim mostly false however is the fact that he calls upon his followers to sign a petition addressed at the European Union to change it. But changing national legislation via a European citizen initiative is not possible. There is no European law that states that aid to illegal migrants should be penalised, so it is not possible to stop these practices at that level. Signing the European citizen initiative will thus not affect penalising or dispensing penalties for aid to illegal migrants. Based on this, we mark Reinier van Lanschot’s claim as: mostly false.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Charlie van Dijk, Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, NL;https://twitter.com/RLanschot/status/1093077236494884864,https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/criminalization,https://twitter.com/RLanschot/status/1093077236494884864,https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0090&from=EN,https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2014/criminalisation-migrants-irregular-situation-and-persons-engaging-them,https://www.justiceandpeace.nl/act/awelcomingeurope/?noredirect=en_GB,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/pro-refugee-italian-mayor-arrested-suspicion-aiding-illegal-migration-domenico-lucano-riace,http://cphpost.dk/news/two-danish-aid-workers-charged-with-human-trafficking-in-greece.html,https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-van-dijk/,https://www.instagram.com/;“Sign EU-petition to stop punishment of aid to migrants”;;;;;;
198;;;;U;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-finland-has-the-loosest-family-reunification-policy-of-all-the-nordic-countries/;“Finland has the loosest family reunification policy of all the Nordic countries”;2019-03-11;eufactcheck;;On 21 January, Finnish parliament member Olli Immonen stated in his blog that “Finland currently has the loosest asylum policy in the Nordic countries when it comes to, for example, family reunification.” Our research shows that norms and practices related to asylum policies are so complex that it is not possible to make a reliable comparison between countries. Immigration is a big point of discussion in Europe and will likely be an important theme for the upcoming EU election. According to the Eurobarometer conducted in 2018, immigration was an important theme for most Finnish responders. According to the same survey, immigration was also an important theme in Finland.   Immonen is a member of the Finns Party. Both he and his party are known for their immigration-critical rhetoric. According to their immigration policy program from 2019, they want to put an end to humanitarian immigration to Finland. We could not reach Immonen to comment on what sources he based his statement on.   For fact checking we utilized the website of Finnish immigration service MIGRI, an e-mail interview with the Finnish Refugee Advice Centre and also reports by the immigration services of the countries compared as well as their websites.  Because Immonen used family reunification as an example of Finland having the loosest refugee policy in the Nordic countries, we will be focusing on family reunification regulations specifically. We did not compare the entire asylum policies which would have been too vast a task. Because family reunification is an extremely broad and multifaceted subject, we focused on the most comparable and simultaneously relevant areas. These are, for example, income requirements and residence permit applications and their processing times. The criteria used were recommended to us by an expert on the subject. During our process, we realized that Finland and Sweden have the least restrictive regulations when it comes to family reunification. Iceland, Denmark and Norway have distinctly tighter criteria and regulations. For this reason, we will mainly focus on comparing Finland and Sweden. The sponsor and the applicant The sponsor is the family member already in the destination country seeking to bring his or her family over.  In Finland, the sponsor is required to have a valid residence permit at the time of application. Family members that can apply for reunification are spouses, registered partners, cohabiting partners, parents and children under the age of 18. In Sweden the sponsor must have a permanent residence permit or they must have been granted asylum as a refugee. If the permit of the sponsor is temporary, they are required to be at least 21 years of age and they must have cohabited with the person who they will be living with.   In Denmark the criteria are stricter than in Finland. The sponsor must have lived in the country for a minimum of three years and he or she must have a permanent residence permit and they must also pass two exams in Danish. In Iceland and Norway, the sponsor is required to have lived in the country for a minimum of four years. They must also be able to prove they are either working or studying. As such, in this regard the criteria in Finland are the least strict. The age of the applicant is also a relevant question. An underage applicant is defined differently in different countries. In all other Nordic countries with the exception of Denmark, an underage applicant is defined as being under 18 years old. In Denmark an applicant under the age of 15 is considered underage.   Maintenance requirements When comparing maintenance requirements, we looked at the requirements for households comprising two adults. In Finland, the required income for two adults is 16 800 euros a year. Some welfare benefits received also counts as income. In Sweden, in 2019, the required income for two adults is 9 261 euros a year. The income must be work-related, which includes for example pay from work, unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or earnings-related old-age pension. In this regard Finland’s requirements are at least in most cases stricter than Sweden`s. The residence permit application process In Finland the one submitting the application must always be the applicant themselves and the applicant must also deliver the application onward by themselves. The application process itself is less strict in Sweden than in Finland. In Sweden, it is possible to ”outsource” the application process to another person by granting them a power of attorney. The processing time for a residence permit application in Finland is 8 to 9 months. In Iceland it’s at maximum 6 months, in Denmark 10 months and in Norway approximately 20 months. In Sweden the processing time floats between 13 to 21 months.  As such, only Iceland has a shorter processing time than Finland. When researching these approximate waiting times, we used the same sample-applicant, a Syrian applying for reunification with their spouse. Residence permit granted based on family reunification In Finland, a successful applicant initially receives a temporary permit typically ranging from 1 to 4 years in length. In Sweden, the initial permit is typically 13 months, but it is technically possible to be granted a permanent residence permit right away.  In Denmark and Norway a successful applicant is typically granted a year-long, temporary permit. In Iceland the length of the granted permit is tied to the length of the permit of the sponsor. As receiving a permanent residence permit is possible in Sweden right away, their regulations in this regard are more lenient than in Finland. Conclusion The factuality of the statement is very hard to prove or disprove. Family reunification regulations and criteria are complicated and there are exceptions and individual differences. The officials who have looked into the matter have also stated in their reports that direct comparison between the Nordic countries is very difficult. Based on the criteria we looked into, we came to the conclusion that Immonen’s statement cannot be proved as either fully true or false. We concluded that Finland and Sweden have the least restrictive regulations when it comes to family reunification. However, determining which criteria are the most important is not directly possible.

A lot of money which according to N-VA is anything but an example of good governance. The party does not mention any calculation method; our research shows that the statement is mostly false.  In 1992, the Member States of the European Union stipulated that the European Parliament would hold twelve plenary sessions each year in Strasbourg, on the symbolic border between France and Germany. The Members of the European Parliament and their staff (about 4,000 passengers in total) then take the train, car or plane along with their documents to meet for four days. When there are no meetings in Strasbourg, the buildings are abandoned, and only a small group of employees is present. What are N-VA’s sources? There are many various calculations to be found online on the cost of the Strasbourg sitting, ranging from 55 million to 203 million. N-VA deputy spokesman Xavier Lesenne reveals that N-VA obtains their estimate of 200 million euros on a November 2013 resolution. In this resolution, the European Parliament mentions an estimate of 169 to 203 million euros annually. For this, they refer to a report by the Secretary-General of the European Parliament from 2002. According to the parliament, this calculation was still the most correct and recent one in 2013. These figures include the cost of renting the buildings and maintenance, technical equipment and furniture, staff and other operating expenses (such as telephone subscriptions and insurance). Meanwhile, these figures are no longer up to date in 2019. 2014: A new study In the meantime, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) carried out a further analysis of the potential savings if all meetings were held in Brussels, following a request from the Parliament. Their estimate of the cost of the monthly move is 113.800.000 euro, which is 86,2 million euros lower than what N-VA claims. Between 2002 and 2014, the situation has mainly changed according to the ECA because the European Union bought its buildings in Strasbourg and therefore no longer has to pay rent. The press officer of the European Court of Auditors, Damijan Fišer, confirms that after 2014 no further research was carried out by the Court of Auditors. To be correct, N-VA should have relied on these more recent data from the ECA, rather than on the older documents. Conclusion: After we had contacted them, N-VA admitted that they should have used more recent figures since the party claimed that the monthly move of the EP costs 200 million euros. However, the European Court of Auditors calculated the costs of travelling around 86,2 million less. But the party maintains its opinion that this ‘travelling circus’ does not bring any added value and entails irresponsible costs to taxpayers.

200;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-hungary-spends-18-million-euros-on-campaign-against-sargentini/;“Hungary spends 18 million euros on campaign against Sargentini”;2019-03-05;eufactcheck;;Sargentini: “Hungary spends 18 million euros on campaign against me”. This is what the Dutch radio news show Met het Oog op Morgen (‘In View of Tomorrow’) reported on 5 February 2019 on its website. The claim is mostly true. The claim stems from an interview with Judith Sargentini, Member of European Parliament for the Dutch Green Left party. In the interview, she states: ,,The (Hungarian) government has earmarked 18 million euros for a smear campaign against me personally and against the European Parliament.’’ Sargentini’s report on the declining rule of law in Hungary was approved by the European Parliament in September 2018. This allows for an Article 7 procedure under the Lisbon Treaty, which may lead to EU sanctions for Hungary. In the interview, Sargentini does not mention the source of her claim. The campaign involves films, billboards and tweets. It also targets investor-philantropist George Soros and liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt. Recently, EU Commission leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Frans Timmermans have been added as targets. Asked about her source, Sargentini points to an article from Atlatszo – a Hungarian watchdog NGO. Its headline reads: ‘Hungarian government allocated €18.2 million of taxpayers money on advertising campaign against Sargentini, Soros, and Verhofstadt’. From an article in Hungary Today it becomes clear that the number of 18.2 million euro is based on the data found on the site of the state institution Public Procurement Authority, a central budgetary organ subordinated to Hungarian Parliament. Its logo is also visible in the campaign films. When asked, attorney Balázs Toth of Atlatszo refers to a specific document on the PPA-site where the figure is given. The estimated value of the campaign is 5.905.511.811 Hungarian forint, which equals approximately 18.6 million euros. This means that the amount mentioned by Sargentini is more or less correct. Conclusion: The claim “Hungary spends 18 million on campaign against me (Sargentini)” is mostly true. The correct amount is about 18.6 million euro. The campaign targets not only Sargentini but other EU politicians and Soros as well.;https://www.nporadio1.nl/homepage/14497-judith-sargentini-hongarije-besteedt-18-miljoen-euro-aan-lastercampagne-tegen-mij,https://www.boell.de/en/2018/09/19/sargentini-report-its-background-and-what-it-means-hungary-and-eu,https://english.atlatszo.hu/2018/10/05/hungarian-government-sargentini/,https://english.atlatszo.hu/about-us-fundraising/,https://hungarytoday.hu/in-the-wake-of-the-sargentini-report-govt-launches-new-campaign/,https://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/cikkek/basic-information,https://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/adatbazis/megtekint/hirdetmeny/portal_18838_2018/,https://www.instagram.com/;“Hungary spends 18 million euros on campaign against Sargentini”;;;;;;
201;;;;T;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/microsoft-fear-of-cyber-attacks-ahead-of-eu-elections/;“Microsoft;2019-02-28;eufactcheck;;On 20th February 2019 Athens Voice published an article “Microsoft: Fear of cyber attacks ahead of EU elections”, according to which the American software company Microsoft in Germany, issued a notice, aimed at politicians and civil society organizations, striking the risk of a possible hacker attack, ahead of the European elections next May. Microsoft report mentions that a series of attacks has taken place between September and December 2018, against the staff of a large number of “think tanks” in Germany, such as the Foreign Relations Council, the Aspen Institute and the German Marshall Fund, is the “Strontium” and as widely known “FancyBear” or “ART28”. The attacks against these organizations targeted 104 accounts belonging to organization employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, and Romania. In the end, the report cites a statement in POLITICO, in an interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, by former NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, warned of the danger of “foreign forces targeting many of the electoral confrontations, “or” chalking “electoral systems, or by spreading” toxic news “to electronics but also to traditional media, as he stated.  Athens Voice’s article has been found on at least twenty (20) other Greek sites, with an identical wording, reproducing substantially the same content, with a source of transmission, a publication of the Athenian-Macedonian News Agency. The only exception of published articles is the liberal.gr website, which is enriched in more details and makes more extensive reference to the issue, citing Tom Burt statements. Particularly, the post of liberal.gr after a full reference to all the information published by other websites notifies the intention of the technology giant to provide enhanced protection in 12 more European markets, including France, Germany, and Sweden. The liberal.gr also reports on the way in which attacks are made, noting that “they were made through malicious web sites and bogus e-mail addresses, which nevertheless appeared to be legitimate”, adding that these attacks are being investigated. Microsoft’s announcement During the searching process for Microsoft’s relevant announcement, which is cited by all sites as a source of publication, was identified on the blog platform of the company used to exchange views on issues affecting Europe in the digital age, an extensive announcement by the corporate vice president, responsible for customer security and trust, Tom Burt, exactly the same date that the news was published on Athenian-Macedonian News Agency and reproduced by rest Greek websites. In this publication, entitled “New steps to protect Europe from cyber threats”, Tom Burt after initially announces the expansion of the new security service from cyber threats (Microsoft AccountGuard) to twelve new markets throughout Europe, then refers extensively to ongoing attacks and the way they have been noted in recent years in countries of Europe, and in particular to the employees of the German, French, Belgian, Polish, Romanian and Serbian governments, while pointing out the justifiable fear of European leaders. Finally, it makes special reference to the Microsoft AccountGuard extension and to the future plans of the technological giant. It is remarkable that the Athenian-Macedonian News Agency on his telegram, while detailing these attacks, makes no reference to the attacks by Serbian government officials, according to according to Tom Burt. A possible explanation for the incomplete reference may be the fact that Serbia is not a member of the EU, although the country is on track to join and the news agency’s report focuses mainly on hacker attacks in view of the European elections. Regarding the statement of the former NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, this is confirmed here. Appraisal Therefore, it is clear that out of the 21 sites that published the news of new hacker attacks in view of the European elections, 20 of them replicated the news from the Athenian-Macedonian News Agency (including Athens Voice) and only one site made more extensive reference on the subject. The Greek news agency used the company’s announcement as a basic source of information for its publication, in a concise and comprehensive way, without the slightest mention to Tom Burt and similarly, Athens Voice reproduced it. If the absence of a naming reference to Microsoft’s vice president is excluded, the content of the publication as it was transmitted is accurate and true, although it could be observed that it is of limited size with respect to the source material.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Ioanna Eskiadi and Stella Antonakopoulou, School of Journalism & MC, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;https://www.instagram.com/;“Microsoft;;;;;;
202;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-turnout-at-national-elections-in-europe-is-between-70-and-80-percent/;“Turnout at national elections in Europe is between 70 and 80 percent”;2019-02-28;eufactcheck;;"In a recent publication on the opinion page of the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, historian Ronald Havenaar tries to combat rising cultural pessimism in Europe by pointing to average voter turnouts of between 70 and 80 percent. We rate the claim as mostly false.  According to Havenaar, high voter turnout is indicative of ‘a solid foundation, something current doomsday thinkers fail to recognize’. An average turnout of up to 80 percent is indeed impressive, but does the statistic hold up?   Source The article is a prepublication of the historian’s latest book, Naar de bliksem, maar nu nog niet (‘Going to hell, but not yet’), published on 7 February. The claim is repeated in the book and provides a source book (Ruling the Void by Peter Mair), which states that the average turnout across western Europe fell from 81.7 percent to 77.6 percent in the 1990s, and to 75.8 in the 2000s. But this is the average in western Europe, so is a limited statistic, and it’s the average between 2000-2010. That might not be long ago, but as the source book points out: ‘The more recent the elections, the more likely they are to record troughs in participation.’ That’s why it’s crucial to use the most recent turnout statistics.   Databases The source book itself uses multiple sources to back up the statistics: two books from 2002 (which will lack recent turnout numbers), and multiple online election databases that are managed by various organizations: Parlgov, a website run by the University of Bremen keeps track of European election statistics. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international partnership of parliaments, also keeps track of those numbers. And there’s the International IDEA, which supports the development of democracies around the world. The latter has a voter turnout database with elaborate turnout statistics. International IDEA usually pulls its statistics directly from national reports and official announcements. We used these databases to calculate the most recent average voter turnout at national elections (our calculations can be downloaded here).According to these statistics, average voter turnout in Europe is 64.9 percent. That’s between 5.1 and 15.1 percent lower that the claimed 70 to 80 percent. The average for western Europe is 71,9%.      A report from International IDEA from december 2016 also shows that there has been a steady decline in European voter turnout since the end of the 1980s, which amounts to around 20 percent. It is a worldwide phenomenon, but the decline in Europe is greater than in other parts of the world. Around 1995 the average turnout dipped below 70 percent.   Established vs. post-communist Furthermore, the report distinguishes between ‘established European democracies’ like Denmark and Spain, and ‘post-communist countries’ like Hungary and Serbia. The reason for the distinction is because voter turnout in the second category is declining faster than in the first one. ‘The decline in Europe is disproportionately due to the sharp fall in voter turnout in the post-communist countries’, the report states. The established European democracies show a decline of 10 percent, which is half of the continent’s average.   Causes The report provides a number of explanations for the declining numbers. For instance, the enthusiasm for elections may be higher in a ‘new’ democracy and slowly decrease for subsequent elections. General disappointment in the democratic system could also be at play. Into the Void, Havenaar’s source book, states other possible causes, like generational shifts and ‘sheer boredom’. These are possible factors; the report is not able to give a definitive answer.   Conclusion In his publication, Havenaar argues that Europe is stronger than we might think and that there is no reason to be drawn into doomsday scenarios. One of his arguments is the high turnout at national elections. But although the turnout is still not unsubstantial, the statistic seems to be a bit too optimistic.

203;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-catalan-public-media-lacks-objectivity-and-pluralism/;“Catalan public media lacks objectivity and pluralism”;2019-02-22;eufactcheck;;In recent years, public media in Spain have been questioned because they are commonly accused of serving particular political tendencies. In the case of the Catalan public broadcasting, the claim arrived to the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament in January 2019. Two complainants accused the Catalan public television (TV3) and radio station (Catalunya Radio), of “lacking objectivity and pluralism”. Their claims turn out to be mostly false.   Scrutinizing those claims is central in the run-up to the forthcoming European elections. The petitions made in the European Parliament Commission included certain information that should be thoroughly verified. At the same time, it is important to explain who are the people behind those petitions. The complainants, C.E.R. and Sergio Santamaría, had previously been members of the conservative party Partido Popular (PP) and had even participated in their electoral lists.   Partido Popular (PP) and other non-separatist parties have repeatedly denounced the political bias of TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio. However, data from Center for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom show that the media system in Spain has a high risk on receiving political influence, reporting cases in TV3 but also in the Spanish public broadcasting, TVE, and other Spanish private news outlet like El País. In fact, the News Council of TVE has also registered a petition in the European Parliament reporting political influence in its own channel.   Why has Partido Popular (PP) set TV3 as an object of their complaint? Non-separatist parties have focused on denouncing TV3 due its importance in the Catalan territory. TV3 is the broadcasting leader in Catalonia in contrast to all the Spanish news outlets, which turns the Catalan public media into the most significant broadcasting station in the territory. It is also the only public-owned news outlet headquartered in Barcelona.    Petitions registered in the European Parliament Commission The debate of the two petitions against TV3 took place on 22nd January 2019, with the participation of the petitioners but also of Lluís Caelles, the President of the Professional Commission of TV3, some European MPs and other experts. Both petitions are still open and therefore, verifying the facts can contribute to the investigation. You will find the petitioners’ facts checked hereunder.  “On the October 2nd 2017, there was a broadcast for children. They showed the referendum of October 1st saying that the police who were trying to ensure the rule of law were the ‘baddies’ basically and the people who were trying to cover up the ballot boxes were the ‘goodies’”. FALSE  On the October 2nd, TV3’s news bulletin addressed to children, InfoK, talked about the 1-O referendum, coinciding with the International Day of Non-Violence. The program was focused on the incidents occurred the day before, describing the images of violence as “people quarrelling”, talking about “peace” and “democracy”. They also covered how schools dealt with children’s concerns about adult’s behaviour, who “do not agree with each other”, and the flaws caused by the violence in polling stations and schools. Just in one occasion, InfoK indicated that the Spanish police used excessive force and violence to enter the polling places and injured several people.    “We have the speech made by the ex-President Puigdemont, already dismissed from his position, who was presented on the Catalan public television as if he was still the Catalan President, when he’s not […] Meanwhile, the speech of the Spanish monarch was omitted, as it happens every year”. FALSE  TV3 presented Carles Puigdemont as the Catalan President just one time after being quitted by the Spanish government. It was a video published 24 hours after his removal, which was retrieved from a previous broadcast. On the other hand, TV3 has never omitted the speech of King Felipe VI. Since 2017, the speeches made by the monarch have been relegated to the 24-hour news channel of the media group, Canal 3/24, in order to do not interrupt the evening news bulletin, where they broadcast minutes later its main points. In fact, there is no legal obligation to air his speech. The Basque television (EiTB) does not broadcast it either.    “The distribution in the debates is usually in favour of those panellists who are pro-independence against those who are defending the rule of law”. FALSE  TV3 has been denounced for its lack of plurality. Despite this, data from the Catalan Audiovisual Council prove that TV3 is one of the most plural broadcasters in Spain. Here you can see the time percentage dedicated by TV3 to each political party during the last elections in Catalonia, in contrast to La1, Telecinco and Antena 3.     “We also have the warnings that these professionals have received from neutral organisms such as Junta Electoral Central (JEC), integrated by magistrates that supervise and control the functioning and legality of TV3”. FALSE  The JEC is an organism composed by eight judges of the Supreme Court and five law professors proposed by the political parties. So is not as “neutral” as the petitioners said. At the end of 2017 and before the Catalan elections of December 21st, this organism prohibited TV3 from using expressions such as “imprisoned councillors” to speak of the government dismissed by the application of article 155 of the Spanish constitution following the referendum on October 1.    “There have been pressures on magistrates of the supreme court. Judge Pablo Llarena himself and his family have seen how television programs published private data of themselves that have materialized in violent actions”. FALSE  “Tot es Mou” is the program where the 26th March this data about Llarena was released. The day before this program, Llarena’s house in the Pyrenees had been painted yellow by the youth organisation Arran. In November last year, Arran painted Llarena’s house in Sant Cugat, but it cannot be said that these actions were triggered by the information about him shown in TV3, because the Arran’s campaign against the judge had started before this personal data was published. For this reason, the CAC exculpated TV3 for this accusation.    “On a TV3 program, the president of Spain was compared with Hitler. What public television of Europe would Nazism be banalized? On what public television would you compare a democratic leader to the biggest genocide in Europe? That has happened on TV3!”. FALSE    “Polonia” is not a news programme, but a comedy program characterized by caricaturing the political reality. This caricature of former President Rajoy appeared on November 12th, 2012, after the 9N vote, which the Spanish government argued had not been carried out and was unconstitutional. The gag recreated the famous Downfall’s Bunker scene, a recurring scene in parodies, also used by the BBC in a parody of Tony Blair.   In conclusion, the Spanish media framework must be taken into consideration when it comes to analysing the editorial independence of public media since it is very different from other models such as the British one. In Spain, public media depend economically on institutions, which also makes them less independent when it comes to developing a completely autonomous editorial line. However, and beyond this assessment, we must differentiate between editorial line and informative content. Bearing in mind the aforementioned checks, we can state the claims that Catalan public media lack objectivity and pluralism are mostly false.

The claim turns out to be mostly false.  The information comes from a report by Pew Research Center that posted the results of their research on their Twitter account on the 30th of January 2019. The same research was used in an article from Belgian newspaper De Standaard. In this article the results were translated for the readers but the journalist did not conclude that The Netherlands is the least anti-muslim country in Europe. De Standaard only reported the results of the research. Source: PEW Research Center. http://www.pewforum.org/2018/10/29/eastern-and-western-europeans-differ-on-importance-of-religion-views-of-minorities-and-key-social-issues/ The report was produced bij Pew Research Center as a part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, which analyzes religious change and its impact on societies around the world. The research was conducted between 2015 and 2017 but was released with new results from research in Slovakia. Muslims in your family? Market research company GfK Belgium did the research in Western Europe and Slovakia with an average of 1500 respondents per country by telephone. In Eastern Europe the research was done by Ipsos MORI, Institute for Comparative Social Research (CESSI) and Georgian Opinion Research Business International (GORBI) with an average of 1400 respondents per country with the difference that the results were collected by face to face interviews. Oversampling was done in some countries to boost the sample size of smaller subgroups.  The question Pew asked the respondents was: “Would you be willing to accept jews/muslims as members of your family/neighbours?” The results of this report were that The Netherlands is the most accepting of muslims with a total of 88%. Followed by Norway with 82% and Denmark with 81%.

She also stated that there is a difference between the results of interviews done face to face or by telephone. Van Assche also says that the key question that Pew asked the respondents doesn’t relate to the quote that De Dagelijkse Standaard published on their website. Therefore stating that the Dutch are the least anti-muslim is a blunt conclusion. She does confirm that the research centers who cooperated are renowned.

He also says that the countries in Eastern Europe experience more problems with the border conflict and that the political parties campaign against migration. Therefore it’s more socially accepted to be against muslims. He also questions the research strategy. Unia did their own research by asking indirect questions to avoid their respondent answering in a socially accepted way rather than answering truthfully.  In short, the method used for this research is acceptable but can always be done more refined. As for the claim from De Dagelijkse Standaard we can say that it’s mostly false as the information is used and interpreted differently than in the actual research.

205;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-80-of-the-total-load-of-endocrine-disruptors-come-from-food/;“80% of the total load of BPA and endocrine disruptors come from food”;2019-02-20;eufactcheck;;"On June 24, 2018, speaking on France Culture, the toxicologist André Cicolella claimed that “80% of the total load of endocrine disruptors comes from food.” While plausible, this figure has yet to be substantiated.  On an episode of the show “De cause à effets” (EN: “From Cause to Effects”) that aired on France Culture on June 24, 2018, André Cicolella, a toxicologist and president of the Réseau Environnement Santé (EN: Health Environment Network), stated: “80% of the total load of endocrine disruptors comes from food.”André Cicolella (drawing by Marie Desrumaux) Contacted by phone, André Cicolella himself questions the source of his assertion. He remains vague, suggesting that the percentage is “an estimate from ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail; the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) for the major categories of endocrine disruptors.” On the ANSES website, the page on endocrine disruptors explains that experts at the agency have studied “around thirty substances.” The article also mentions that these studies “determined the share of exposure from food (80%).” Skimming the text, it is possible to deduce that André Cicolella’s claim is based on the research that led to this figure. However, the percentage mentioned here comes from two studies related to “the health effects and the uses of bisphenol A” conducted in 2013. That is to say, a very specific substance. André Cicolella is thus over-generalizing when he applies the 80% figure to all endocrine disruptors. Context : Bisphenol, Banned in food containers since 2015 Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic chemical substance used as a component in certain plastics, resins, and inks. It is used in the manufacture of food containers such as (feeding) bottles, as well as certain toys. It can also be found in the protective coating that lines the inside of cans, and even on sales receipts. Humans can be exposed to BPA when the molecule spreads from the plastic to the food. This phenomenon especially occurs when a food product wrapped in plastic is cooked or heated. Bisphenol A can also transfer to food when resins protecting the inside of cans degrade. Scientists concurred that BPA was an endocrine disruptor. Studies showed that it affected reproduction and the development of breast and prostate cancer, and played a role in certain cardiovascular diseases, as well as in the appearance of behavioral and development issues in children. France banned the sale of feeding bottles containing bisphenol A in 2010. The European Union followed suit in 2011. Since January 1, 2015, any container or utensil containing BPA and designed to come in direct contact with food is prohibited from sale in France. Context : No data for all endocrine disruptors Sakina Mhaouty-Kodja, a research director at CNRS (the French National Center for Scientific Research) and an expert with ANSES, confirms that there are “no figures” regarding the share of food in exposure to major types of endocrine disruptors. “This variable is unique to each molecule,” the neuro-endocrinologist explains. We know, she points out, that “exposure to certain substances, like bisphenol A and phthalates, primarily occurs through eating.” But the claim that 80% of all endocrine disruptors are spread via food is still impossible to verify. “There is not enough available data,” concludes Sakina Mhaouty-Kodja. This opinion is shared by Robert Barouki, a biochemist and toxicologist at INSERM (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale; the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research). “The majority of contamination to endocrine disruptors comes from food,” the researcher states. And according to him, pesticides constitute “the bulk of the army” of endocrine disruptors present in food. In short : As André Cicolella himself questions the source of his assertion, we concluded that the claim : “80% of the total load of endocrine disruptors comes from food” is mostly false, at least.

206;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-the-number-of-suicides-in-greece-increased-with-forty-per-cent/;“The number of suicides in Greece increased with forty per cent”;2019-02-19;eufactcheck;;According to a November report of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the number of suicides in Greece increased by forty per cent between 2010 and 2015, as a result of the economic crisis. This is mostly true. The death rate relating to suicide would have increased by 7,8 per cent per year since 2009. The report of HR Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic refers to an article from the Greek Reporter of April 11, 2017. However, the article on this news website does not mention a forty per cent increase between 2010 and 2015, but only a yearly increase of 7,8 per cent. The Greek Reporter doesn’t name the research report that shows the increase of 7,8 per cent. It only refers to the researchers: ‘Philip Philippides’ from the School of Public Health at the Imperial College London, ‘John Toundas’, professor of Social and Preventive Medicine in Athens and ‘Vasiliki Gerovasili’ from the Harefield Hospital in London. After we tracked down the original report, we concluded that the Greek Reporter misspelled names of the researchers and institutions, including those of Filippos T. Filippidis and Yannis Tountas. The original research paper doesn’t mention a forty per cent increase of suicides in Greece between 2010 and 2015. Only the annual increase of 7,8 per cent between 2010 and 2014 was mentioned. We converted the given numbers and concluded, after a calculation, that the stated forty per cent was most probably correct. The percentage was actually rounded down. Sample calculation If the number of suicides was 100 in 2009: 2009: 100  2010: 107,8  2011: 116,2084  2012: 125,2726552  2013: 135,0439223056  2014: 145,5773482454 Conclusion: Based on the data provided by the report by Philip Philippides from the School of Public Health, there was an increase of 45,58% in the number of suicides in Greece between 2010-2014. We can conclude that the statement that was made in the report of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe is predominantly true.

207;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-more-dutch-weed-farms-in-foreign-countries/;“More Dutch weed farms in foreign countries”;2019-02-14;eufactcheck;;On the 3rd of February 2019, several newspapers including Metro reported that more weed farms with Dutch characteristics were being discovered in countries across Europe. The articles were written due to the report from the investigative journalism programme Reporter Radio on Dutch radio station NPO Radio 1. The claim seems to be mostly true. In the article, various people who speak in the Reporter Radio program are cited. First there are mostly statements about the weed trade connection between the Netherlands and Belgium, by Marc Vancoillie who is the chief of the Belgian federal police’s drugs department. Mr. Vancoillie says that lots of Dutch individuals are found in Belgian drug networks. However, he nor anyone else of the federal police was accessible for further comment on that statement and no national numbers are public on exactly how many Dutch individuals are detained. There were some specific numbers for the province of Antwerp though which showed a clear increase in dismantled weed farms, involvement of Dutch people and dismantled drug houses. Numbers from Kristof Aerts, communication specialist from Antwerp’s Public Prosecution Office, data retrieved via Sander Bartling. (Translation: Plantations / Arrested Dutch / Drug houses) Alongside the numbers from Antwerp, data from the provinces of Limburg and Liège were also provided. These three provinces have direct highways connected to the Netherlands. Limburg only reported on the year of 2018, with 148 weed farms dismantled. Liège reported an increase from 98 drug farm related case files in 2016 to 169 case files in 2018. A report on illegal drugs trade in Belgium and the Netherlands, made by researchers at Ghent University and others, states a total of 1234 discovered farms across all of Belgium in 2017. That backs the claim in Reporter Radio of about 1200 discovered farms. Yearly amount of weed farms discovered in Belgium. Table from the study published at Ghent University. While Belgium generally has had a stable amount of dismantled plantations since 2011, when looking at other European countries general increases are visible. Laurent Laniel of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) states in Reporter Radio that around 500 weed farms were found in Spain but without any specifics about Dutch weed farms. According to him, the characteristics would include involvement of Dutch individuals as well as Dutch devices being used at the plantations. By contacting the Spanish Ministry of Internal Affairs, we discovered that the amount of Dutch people that were detained in all of Spain did significantly increase from 368 in 2010 to 553 in 2017. The numbers do not specify what they were arrested for, so we can’t say whether the increase of arrests is due to the weed farms. The total of Dutch individuals in all of Spain, not specifically related to drugs. Source: Spanish Ministry of Internal Affairs. Another of Laniels claims was that Dutch drug traders own apartments for their operations in Grenada, which is located in the Spanish autonomous region of Andalucía. Statistics for that weren’t made, but looking at the arrests of Dutch individuals per province we are able to tell that the largest amount of arrests is made in Andalucía. Again, there is no specification about drug related arrests.  The total of Dutch arrested individuals per Spanish region, in 2010, 2014 and 2017. Source: the Spanish Ministry of Internal Affairs. Next to Belgium and Spain, Germany also saw an increase in weed farms. In Reporter Radio, spokesperson of the police in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia Frank Scheulen said that the amount of discovered farms multiplied by 2,5 times more in 2017 than in 2016. The number rose from 82 to 222 which actually is an multiplication of 2,7. But once more there were no specifications about the involvement of Dutch individuals. The total of weed farms found in the German ‘land’ of North Rhine-Westphalia. Source: Police of North Rhine-Westphalia. Finally it is worth noting that for some of the contacted people, it seemed the most difficult to answer what exactly defines a “Dutch” weed farm. There aren’t really any statistics available about the Dutch part of the claim. In short, there has been a general increase in weed farms across Europe as well as more involvement of a Dutch presence due to the rising number of detained Dutch individuals. There are no hard numbers about “Dutch” weed farms. That’s why we rate the claim as mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

208;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-di-maio-conte-cabinet-has-the-highest-consensus-in-europe/;Di Maio;2019-02-13;eufactcheck;;On January 23, during an Italian talk show, Luigi Di Maio (deputy prime minister and minister of Labour and Social Policies) declared that, according to a report by Istituto Cattaneo, the cabinet led by Giuseppe Conte is the most popular in Europe. Actually, this is not precise. The report Lo strano caso del consenso al governo Conte (The strange case of Conte cabinet’s consensus) based on ParlGov and Polls of Polls  data, analyzes the consent of both majority and opposition forces of League and 5 Star Movement. The report shows how the government, despite the overwhelming consensus, is not the most popular among all the European countries. At the first place we find Malta’s executive guided by Joseph Muscat, Italian government is at the second place. Malta’s government in fact surpassed the 60% (55,1% in march 2013, + 5%) of liking among its citiziens.  The infographic shows that from the establishing day to the present Conte’s government had the greatest consensus gain, in comparison with the other EU cabinets (from 50,1% of March to 58, 5% of September 2018, +8,4%), but it’s not the most appreciated.  Consensus trend for governments in major Eu countries                                                 Italian government gains popularity, while opposition loses votes   The data provided by Poll of Polls, based on surveys directed from eight institutes (Quorum, Technè, SWG, Euromedia Research, Piepoli, EMG, Index Research, Demos&Pi), confirm the increase of consensus for Conte cabinet, which was on the verge of 60% (+8,4%) between October and November 2018, while it seems it’s dealing with a decrease in last three months, probably due to the disagreement amongst M5S and Lega, regarding the Budget Act.   Instead, regarding the Democratic Party, since March 4th elections, the analysis shows an ostensible stability, with a consensus standard at 18% (-1%), without any decrease and no relevant increases. Slightly different is the trend for the Right-Centre parties, such as Forza Italia, which lost about 3 points in the polls, extimated now between 7,9% (-6,1%), according to Index, and 11,9% (-3,1%), according with Technè. The drop of consent for Silvio Berlusconi’s party, seems to be the result of the rise of Salvini’s new Lega. Between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, Forza Italia touched the lowest rate in its consensus, barely reaching 9% (-5%). At the opposite, Salvini’s Lega became the first Italian party, reaching 32% (+15%). On the other hand, the rise of M5s suddenly stopped after the party started ruling the country. Currently, Di Maio’s party can rely on around 25% of the votes: -8% of the votes obtained at the beginning of March 2018 and far less of Salvini’s estimated percentage.      Consensus of Lega and M5S from March 4 to today   From the polls clearly emerges the gap between the two parties of the cabinet. According to the surveys carried out by SWG, from the date of the settlement, Salvini’s Lega has doubled its percentage of voters. At the elections of March 4th, Lega obtained 17.35%, while on 28th January 2019 it’s extimated at 32.6% (+ 15.25%). Its major increases were recorded after the local and regional elections (April 22nd and June 10th), won by the centre-right, and during the hardest European debates about migration issues (August 25th and January 28th).   Meanwhile, M5S has collapsed, falling from the 32,68% of the elections to the 24,9% (-7,78%) of January 28th. After an initial growth which lead to 35,2% on March 23th (+2,6%), Beppe Grillo’s Movement progressively lost its consensus, especially in the months following the agreement with Lega. The trend inverted only when the Parliament abolished life pensions for the mPs (July 12th) and when the basic income was introduced (September 27th).    The rise of nationalist movements: Europe vs Italy   The rise of the nationalist parties in Europe keeps going. As the latest polls by Pollofpolls.eu show, an alliance between the three major nationalist groups could be the second strongest group inside the European Parliament. If Europe of Nation and  Freedom (ENF), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Europe for Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) will reach an agreement, the european sovereignist wing could surpass 150 seats in the Parliament and rank just behind the European People’s Party (EPP) – which counts 178 seats – and just above the Progressive Alliance of Socialist and Democrats (S&D) – estimated around 135 seats. It seems pretty clear that the next European elections, from the 23rd to the 26th of may 2019, won’t be a fight between Socialists and the People’s party. The new nationalist and euroskeptic political forces, different from the old traditional parties, will play an important role as well. Looking more deeply at the data, it can be seen that there are significant consensus differences among single sovereignist parties. Looking at the data, one can notice the various trends of nationalists in different countries. In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally has come over president Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche!, and it’s estimated as the first party with 22%. In Hungary, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz has the absolute majority of the votes (52%). Great result also for Austrian FPÖ (22%), which, anyway, still ranks behind socialist and populars. Less important are the numbers of nationalist parties in Germany (Alternative für Deutschland at 13%) and Spain (Vox at 11%). Italians live in a unique situation: Salvini’s Lega, as seen, is by far the first party (32%), but the other euroskeptic force, the 5 star Movement, is losing consensus (25%, -8% from the election day). France  Hungary  Austria  Germany  Spain      In short, having Italian cabinet the second highest support rate between Eu govenments, Luigi Di Maio’s statement is mostly true.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

According to a Reuters article from November 7th , she said: “These measures (the import tariffs, ed.) are a clear violation of Kosovo’s obligations under CEFTA.” Also, on December 19th, the European Commission answered a parliamentary question on that subject as follows: ‘the decisions of the Kosovo government to increase up to 100% the tax on goods from Serbia … are a clear violation of CEFTA.’        The statement of the European Commission on the imposed tax increase. Source: Reuters      This recent disagreement between the EU and Kosovo is surprising. Only last summer, the Union initiated talks between the decade-old country and neighbour Serbia, that still considers Kosovo as a southern province rather than an independent state. Also, Kosovo’s capital Pristina hosted the CEFTA Week last December – an event to discuss the state of the trading agreement in a changing world economy.   Import tariffs But, why are there tariffs on Serbian goods? In November, Kosovo’s government imposed the import tariffs of 10 and later 100 percent on Serbian products after the country’s bid to join Interpol failed. Immediately after the failed attempt, Kosovo’s government stated that a ‘fierce campaign of the Republic of Serbia once again proved its character against Kosovo and against the idea of normalizing relations with the Republic of Kosovo’. So, according to the government, Serbia actively lobbied against the attempt to become an Interpol member. Kosovo’s Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has stated that he will only lift the tariffs when Serbia finally recognizes Kosovo as an independent state.   CEFTA According to EU spokeswoman Kocijancic, the imposed tariffs are a ‘clear violation’ of the CEFTA trade agreement between Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo. Macedonia, Albania and Moldova; all countries that aspire EU membership in the near future. The trade agreement was set up for former communist countries, so they could harmonize their economic and legal systems with EU demands. Since its creation in 1992, countries like Hungary and Romania left the agreement after they acquired full EU membership.   Customs and tariffs The CEFTA trade agreement is an extensive document consisting of an original agreement signed in 1992 and multiple amendments, the most recent dating from 2006. In this last amendment, called ‘CEFTA 2006’, the member countries are bound by articles concerning customs for importing and exporting products. One of the aims of the trade agreement is ‘the simplification and facilitation of customs procedures’, which is in accordance with Article 14.4 of the agreement. A subcommittee ensures that ‘Parties shall reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade’, as stated in the Article. The original agreement, signed in 1992 in Poland, states clearly in Article 5 that ‘no new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Parties.’        Article 5 of the CEFTA agreement. Source: CEFTA agreement, 1992      According to the Business Directory, duties are introduced to ‘raise state revenue or to protect domestic industries from more efficient or predatory competitors from abroad’. Haradinaj and his government stated that the recent tariffs are not only used to ‘protect local goods’, but they also serve as protection for their sovereignty:        Official statement on the imposed tariffs. Source: Official website of the Office of the Prime Minister of Kosovo      Based on these statements, Kosovo’s import taxes on Serbian products have an effect similar to that of a customs duty.   National security In spite of the aforementioned Articles, Prime Minister Haradinaj states that his government is on the right side of the argument. Article 18 of the original 1992 version of CEFTA says that the ‘agreement shall not preclude the prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports, or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security.’        Article 18 of the CEFTA agreement. Source: CEFTA agreement, 1992      This basically means that the government of Kosovo can put tariffs in place if they think the security of the country and its people are in danger. On December 3, Haradinaj stated on his Facebook page that the tariffs ‘have the function of protecting national sovereignty and national security and are in compliance with CEFTA.’        Explanation of the imposed tariffs. Source: Official Facebook Page of Kosovo PM Haradinaj        Conclusion This discussion doesn’t seem to have a clear winner. It is not clear whether the argument of Haradinaj and his government, that Kosovo needs to be protected from ‘continuing obstacles that Serbia is making to our country’, will hold. Since the Serbian government already demanded the organization behind CEFTA to resolve the ‘tax problem’ in November, it is still not known which action can be taken. In the meantime, Serbia threatens to start a legal process in an arbitration court if CEFTA fails to end the trade conflict. So in the end, the question if Kosovo is in violation of the agreement might only be answered in an arbitration court in the near future. But, based on the Articles in CEFTA that promote free trade we conclude that the claim is mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

210;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-does-immigration-cost-france-too-much/;“France doesn’t have the means to accomodate more  migrants”, according to “Yellow Jacket” Damien Rieu;2019-02-01;eufactcheck;;"The signing of the Global Compact for Migration was greeted with many comments. Damien Rieu, an activist with the Génération Identitaire movement, “estimates” that France already spends 4.5 billion euros on immigration. He’s basing his figures on Nadine Morano statement.  The Global Compact for Migration triggered many arguments and reactions in France, especially on social media. Signed by France on Monday, December 10, 2018, it also reignited the eternal debate on the “cost of immigration.”  On Twitter, Facebook, and even YouTube, activists claiming to represent identity-based movements spoke out before the Compact for Global Migration had even been signed. Among them, Damien Rieu expressed concern about the signing of the pact in a video posted on December 5, 2018. A member of the Génération Identitaire movement (a nationalist movement in Europe) and the National Front, Damien Rieu warns that France “doesn’t have the means to accommodate more migrants.” According to him, the French state already spends 4.5 billion euros on immigration, including “1.5 billion euros on integration, 2 billion on unaccompanied minors, and 1 billion on state medical assistance to migrants.” The YouTube video has over 53,000 views. While these figures are accurate, they are not enough to draw up a balance sheet for immigration. Damien Rieu explains that he borrowed from Nadine Morano’s statement while she was a guest on the show BFM Story on Tuesday, November 27, 2018. Morano criticized the budget in the 2019 appropriations bill, particularly the 200 million euro increase to the budget for “integration.” Immigrants? Foreigners? Who are we talking about? The United Nations defines an immigrant as a foreign person, born abroad and residing for a year or more in a given country. In the immigrant category, then, we can include Erasmus students who stay longer than a year. The term “foreigner” refers to an individual residing in France who does not have French citizenship. Not all foreigners are necessarily immigrants (e.g. tourists), nor are all immigrants necessarily foreign (e.g. naturalized French). INSEE (the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) puts the immigrant population in France at 6.2 million in 2015, or 9.3% of the total population. 2.4 million immigrants, or 39% of this group, have acquired French citizenship. The foreign population living in France is 4.4 million, or 6.7% of the total population. (c) eufactcheck So, are these immigration numbers true or false? The figures given by Damien Rieu seem to be correct. The 2019 appropriations bill does include 1.58 billion euros for the “immigration, asylum, and integration” mandate. It includes the 303 program (“Immigration and Asylum”) that groups “public policy resources related to: foreigners entering, circulating, traveling, and working; the removal of individuals without legal status; and the pursuit of the right to asylum.” State medical assistance (AME), meanwhile, was estimated at upwards of 923 million euros in 2018. Created in 2001, AME is a framework allowing foreigners without legal status to access care, provided that they have resided in France for over 3 months. François-Noël Buffet, the Republican senator from the Rhône, estimates that more than 310,000 people currently receive this benefit. Furthermore, the Senate voted in early December to lower the budget for AME by 300 million in 2019. The health minister Agnès Buzyn expressed her disagreement with this decision. But this decrease could soon be invalidated by the National Assembly. On the second point raised by Damien Rieu, the Assemblée des départements de France (Assembly of French Departments) estimates that French departments accommodated 40,000 unaccompanied minors of immigrant background in 2018. If we factor in the cost of caring for a foreign minor through child welfare, estimated at 50,000 euros per year on average, this totals 2 billion euros.  But this level of spending for each unaccompanied minor is “unlikely,” says Catherine Wihtol de Wenden, a politician and researcher specializing in migration issues. Jean-Christophe Dumont, an economist at the OECD (in the International Migration division) believes that “the cost of providing aid to unaccompanied minors is virtually impossible to quantify, because there is no established budget item.” Experts say immigration is not only a cost But does immigration only have a cost? Jean-Christophe Dumont perceives in Damien Rieu’s video a “biased way of presenting things. … Immigrants pay taxes and consume like everyone else, while they receive less welfare than most French people.” Like Dumont, several other economists call for the costs to be weighed alongside the contributions. Catherine Wihtol de Wenden asserts that “immigration yields more than it costs.” As proof, she cites German growth in 2017, boosted by the welcoming of a million refugees in the previous year. A 2010 report from DREES (a department of the French Ministry of Health) led by the economist Hillel Rapoport estimates the net contribution of immigrants to public finances in 2005 at 4 billion euros. At the conclusion of a study on several countries in western Europe conducted between 1985 and 2015, three economics researchers at CNRS (the French National Center for Scientific Research)—Hippolyte d’Albis, Ekrame Boubtane, and Dramane Coulibaly—demonstrated a “beneficial effect of migration on the economy.” In particular, they observed a “positive effect on public finance: as public spending increases, so too does revenue in terms of tax and contributions.” But this positive effect of immigration is not automatic. Jean-Christophe Dumont believes “investment in integration is what leads immigration to have a positive impact on growth.” In short : Some of the figures given by Damien Rieu seem to be corrects. But the way he uses them are questionnable. We, students, had lots of debate about this fact check. But as, the video had around 60k views and as the claims is based on Nadine Morano figures (and the politician confirmed it to us on the phone), we decided to  fact check it… and find those assertions, without background are mostly false.   Read our “Behind the facts” to know all about how we did that fact check Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

211;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-5000-people-have-received-asylum-in-sweden/;“5000 people have received asylum in Sweden”;2019-01-21;eufactcheck;;Swedish nationalist party the Swedish Democrats tweeted via their EU account on January 4th 2019, claiming that “5000 people have received asylum in Sweden due to newly introduced law on upper secondary education”. This is mostly true. The Swedish law Gymnasielagen (directly translated as ‘law on upper secondary education’) came into force on July 1st 2018. It is a new law which regulates the asylum procedures for unaccompanied refugees who arrived in the country when they were minors. The asylum application process can take more than a year on average, and many refugees who arrived when they were minors turn 18 before their application is handled. The idea is that these unaccompanied refugees can renew their application and get a new chance to gain a temporary residency through enrolling in high school studies of some form. A screenshot from the tweet by the Swedish Democrats   The new law has been a topic of debate in the country and has been heavily criticised by several national migration courts. The main criticism has revolved around change in what is needed as proof of identity by an asylum seeker. The law of upper secondary education states that a temporary residency can be granted, even if there is no official document proving the asylum seekers identity. National migration courts say that this is against EU asylum policy and the Schengen agreement. The migration court in Gothenburg even brought the new law to the attention of the European Court of Justice. Those who are granted a temporary residency can stay in the country for 13 months. The far right and nationalist Swedish political party the Swedish Democrats have been one of the loudest voices of criticism towards the new legislation. On their EU specific Twitter account, the party states:  “Close to 5000 people have already received asylum in Sweden due to newly introduced ‘law of upper secondary education’. All from Afghanistan, with maybe some exception. Around another 5000 will probably receive asylum in 2019. A “challenge” (newspeak) for the high schools.”  According to the official statistics from the Swedish Migration Agency, 4908 individuals have been granted a temporary residency in Sweden under the new law of upper secondary education in 2018. 4580 of these applicants were of Afghan origin. Hence, the first part of the statement is mostly true. The second part of the statement, referring to the numbers in 2019, is speculative. According to an article in Swedish public service media, a third of the applications under the new law have been rejected. 11,715 refugees have applied for asylum under the law of upper secondary education, and over 7,200 had been considered by the end of 2018.   In short, close to 5000 people have received a temporary residency in Sweden under the new law of upper secondary education, and most of them were from Afghanistan. Nonetheless, that the same amount of people will be granted asylum in 2019 is more uncertain. Therefore, the statement is mostly true.    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

212;;;;M;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-salvini-repatriates-of-migrants-into-italy/;Salvini;2019-01-18;eufactcheck;;In a tweet, Deputy Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Salvini claimed on December 16, 2018: “Repatriates (of migrants into Italy): + 28% since I’m in the government. I am sorry that the opposition and some misinformed journalist even falsify the numbers and the reality.” His claim turns out to be mostly false.  This tweet was in response to an article from the Italian outlet Gazzetta Del Sud, in which it was mentioned that Salvini had also claimed that the number of migrants who had died in the Mediterranean have decreased almost tenfold since last year. Salvini is well known when it comes to his policy on migrants who wish to seek refuge in Italy. He has been vocal in drafting legislation that makes it more difficult for migrants to find shelter within Italy, by removing what has been called certain humanitarian protection statuses. These statuses are meant to help migrants and those in need supplying International protection permits (refugee status and subsidiary protection) for 5 years while humanitarian protection permits are granted for 2 years, according to the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration. In mid 2018, the Italians approved Salvini’s bill, giving reason for a need to check the statistics he tweeted to see if his statement really is true, and not an over-exaggeration in order to make his plan more influential.   A screenshot of the tweet where the original claim by Salvini was found Looking at migrant data from 2018, specifically in the Italian/Central Mediterranean area, there is a noticeable decrease in migrants coming into Italy. However, it is important to note that the decrease is overall, not just in Italy, but in Turkey and the west Balkans as well. In reality, compared to Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean, Italy has only decreased migrant migration by 67% from 2016, while in the east they have seen a drop in at least 90% of migrants (since 2016). Also, specifically in relation to migrants coming by water, arguably the most deadly way for refugees to come into Europe, we see according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that there has been a mass decreasing trend in migrants coming via ocean into Europe since late 2015. The statistic that is most interesting however, is the claim that there is a 28% increase in Italian repatriation of migrants as long as Salvini has been in power. According to the Garante nazionale dei diritti delle persone custodite o privato della libertà personale (Na-tional Guarantor of the rights of guarded persons or deprived of personal freedom) this claim is not a true. Salvini, who has been politically involved since 2009, has held his major position as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy only since the beginning of 2018, which should be assumed as the position he is talking about, due to the pro repatria-tion legislation he has been speaking out for and passing. According to a press release by Garante Nazionale (translated), which is a certified NPM or a national preventive mechanism certified by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture under the United Nations: “In 2017, 6,514 people were forcibly returned, of whom 2870 with international escort and 3644 without international escort. Therefore, an average of about 543 people a month. From 01.01.2018 to 31.10.2018, 5306 persons were forcibly returned, of whom 2889 with international escort and 2417 without international escort. Therefore, an average of about 530 people a month. This means, judging from the monthly average, that the number of forced repatriations made was slightly reduced compared to last year.” Meaning that this is conflicting with Salvini’s 28% increase claim, a statistic that that hard to find other than on noted “alt-right news outlet” sites like Breitbart, where writer Virginia Hale claims  “The number of illegal migrants who were put on airplanes and sent home stood at 2,833 between January 1st and May 31st this year prior to Salvini’s entering the Viminale. Since then, it has risen to 3,626”, contrary to the information provided by the UN related Garante Nazionale.   Though there is a decrease in migrants coming into Italy and the Central Mediterranean, Salvini shouldn’t be too quick in taking all the credit. Even for increasing the number of migrants that Italy sends back to their homeland, we see from primary sources that his numbers and the numbers of questionable news sources do not correlate. And though with Salvini’s legislation passed legislation being less than a year old we might see an increase in repatriations through 2019, however it is not true to say that the rate increased in 2018 compared to other years in Italy before Salvini took office. We therefore conclude that the claim is mostly false.     Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

213;;;;F;;;;eufactcheck;;https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-elephants-poached/;“Almost 50.000 elephants are being poached a year”;2019-01-16;eufactcheck;;When the Netherlands announced a national ban on ivory trade on December 17th 2018, Dutch D66 European Parliament member Gerben Jan Gerbrandy shared an article from the D66’s website. In this article, Gerbrandy is quoted saying: Almost 50.000 elephants are being poached a year.” But reliable data shows this number is way too high.  Gerbrandy continues to state that: “Countries like China and the United States therefore have a total ban [on ivory] and at the beginning of this year, more than thirty African countries begged the European Commission for a European ban. We have to act now. Europe cannot be the reason that elephants in Africa are still being poached.” A screenshot of the article where the original claim by Gerbrandy was found   The number of elephants being poached is set at almost 50.000 by Gerbrandy. The Cambridge Dictionary definition of ‘to poach’ is: “to catch and kill animals without permission on someone else’s land.” The statistics on the number of elephants being poached differs. It’s hard to make an exact calculation since it’s illegal and happens all over the world. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says they keep to the number of around 20.000 elephants a year. That’s an average of 55 a day. But WWF also emphasizes that this number is hard to determine. “Others stay with 30.000 a year, but it for sure is not 50.000,” a WWF spokesperson informs EUfactcheck. WWF base their data on a database from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This organization calculate their numbers on the confiscation of ivory by the authorities and on the amount of found carcasses. This method is called MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants). TRAFFIC, an organisation specialised in wildlife trade, which works closely together with CITES, confirm that the number of elephants being poached is not up to 50.000. According to Dr. Richard Thomas, global communications coordinator at TRAFFIC, the highest estimate that was issued by CITES (based on their MIKE method) is 25.000 elephants per year in 2011. “Since 2011, poaching levels have dropped, although not by a lot and they still remain unacceptably high,” Thomas says. He also mentions that at its worst, the levels of elephant poaching were into the tens of thousands a year, but in recent years these numbers have seriously dropped. These numbers are a world estimate, but most elephants are being poached on the African continent. According to WWF, levels of elephant poaching in Asia are much lower than in Africa and elephant declines there are much more a result of habitat destruction and human wildlife conflict. D66 has let EUfactcheck know that they got their numbers from a BBC article from 2015. They agree that the CITES statistics are more reliable and will change the number in their original article.   The number of elephants getting poached is by far not up to 50.000, but around 20.000 to 30.000. Which is of course still a striking number. We conclude that the claim is false.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.
