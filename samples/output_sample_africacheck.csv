We checked. BasiGo buses ‘fully operational’A closer look at the video finds a speed limit sign on the right side of the road, indicating that vehicles keep right. In Kenya, vehicles drive on the left. Africa Check used the InVid WeVerify video verification tool to extract frames from the clip. We then ran them through a Google reverse image search. This suggested that the video was actually shot in Perugia, a city in the European country of Italy.The image search led us to a longer version of the video, uploaded on an Italian-language YouTube channel on 16 April. A machine translation of its description reads: “Fear in Perugia on Saturday afternoon, on the eve of Easter. It was just after 3 pm when, along the provincial road that goes from Ponte della Pietra to the Marscianese, a methane-powered bus caught fire.”The bus was methane-powered, not electric. Methane is a highly flammable natural gas.A Reuters fact-check pinpoints the exact spot the bus burst into flames.To be sure, Africa Check asked BasiGo if one of their electric buses had caught fire in Nairobi. They said no, adding that their buses were fully operational as part of their pilot programme with Citi Hoppa and East Shuttles.","https://www.facebook.com/groups/260003679517855/posts/355188713332684/,https://twitter.com/CitizzenX/status/1516278325580374018,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szEoQN04huM,https://www.facebook.com/sambazanews.co.ke/posts/478892907360900,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Karen,+Nairobi,+Kenya/@-1.3159522,36.691809,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x182f1c809869d64b:0x199b5604a77f13f5!8m2!3d-1.316866!4d36.6903289,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nairobi,+Kenya/@-0.1825784,35.9063342,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x182f1172d84d49a7:0xf7cf0254b297924c!8m2!3d-1.2920659!4d36.8219462,https://twitter.com/CitizzenX/status/1516278325580374018,https://www.basi-go.com/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-PvRll75IA,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/kenya-increases-gasoline-price-by-3-9-first-rise-in-six-months,https://www.invid-project.eu/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEo7mtxsiSY,https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2022-06/Burning%20Bus-InVID%20WeVerify%20Plugin.pdf,https://africacheck.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2022-06/Google%20Search-Burning%20Bus.pdf,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perugia,+Province+of+Perugia,+Italy/@43.098062,12.3170488,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132ea08cea51c34f:0xce39eb2a884fc7f4!8m2!3d43.1107168!4d12.3908279,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Perugia,+Province+of+Perugia,+Italy/@42.9184317,8.9333225,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132ea08cea51c34f:0xce39eb2a884fc7f4!8m2!3d43.1107168!4d12.3908279,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdHgIT96gt4,https://www.britannica.com/science/methane,https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/flammable,https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-bus-fire-idUSL2N2WN1L4,https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0697398,12.3864837,3a,25.7y,149.15h,83.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shMyDC90foDvHBgBmhdw5EQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192,https://www.basi-go.com/,https://nation.africa/kenya/news/citi-hoppa-east-shuttle-get-electric-buses-3743044,http://www.citihoppa.co.ke/,https://www.eastafricashuttles.com/","Burning electric bus in Nairobi, Kenya?

It looks similar to posts that the news site publishes on Instagram, and the screenshot shared on Twitter and Facebook looks as though it is of an Instagram post.The graphic was posted not long before Jaguar lost the UDA party ticket to defend his Starehe parliamentary seat, a constituency in Nairobi county. It gave the impression that Owino was wooing Jaguar or that Jaguar was consulting Owino about joining the Azimio coalition. Jaguar was upset that the party did not hold primaries in his constituency, and instead chose to use opinion polls to pick his rival. He threatened to run as an independent candidateBut had the lawmaker already “revealed” that he wanted to join Azimio, and did Mpasho report the news? We checked. Old picture, faked graphicWe scrolled through Jaguar’s Twitter timeline and found that the photo with Owino was first posted on 23 November 2021, when the two parliamentarians received a petition at the parliament buildings in Nairobi. Jaguar officially joined UDA on 24 January 2022. The photo is old.On 17 April 2022, Mpasho posted the graphic on its official Facebook account, stamped “FAKE”.“ALERT!!! This post that has been circulating on social media purporting to be from mpasho.co.ke is FAKE and has not been published on our website or any of our social media pages,” Mpasho wrote.Jaguar did not defect and was still on the UDA campaign trail in June 2022.","https://twitter.com/Cjamehk/status/1514470251907457026,http://www.parliament.go.ke/node/3411,https://uda.ke/site/,https://azimio.ke/,http://www.parliament.go.ke/index.php/node/3205,https://www.theafricareport.com/186452/kenya-whos-who-in-raila-odingas-azimio-la-umoja-alliance/,https://www.theafricareport.com/201968/kenya-2022-whos-who-in-william-rutos-kenya-kwanza-alliance/,https://mpasho.co.ke/,https://www.instagram.com/mpashogram/?hl=en,https://twitter.com/Cjamehk/status/1514470251907457026,https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2022/04/jaguar-cries-foul-after-losing-uda-nomination-ticket/https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2022/04/jaguar-cries-foul-after-losing-uda-nomination-ticket/,https://twitter.com/RealJaguarKenya/status/1517210078507679750,https://twitter.com/RealJaguarKenya/status/1517746871468445696,https://twitter.com/RealJaguarKenya,https://twitter.com/RealJaguarKenya/status/1463147834878959623,http://www.parliament.go.ke/,https://twitter.com/thestarkenya/status/1485517764957773825,https://www.facebook.com/955751467785034/posts/5891744090852389,https://www.facebook.com/MpashoNews/?__cft__[0]=AZWYStEfA2GRXEH_syYcuEENn_Gx5ei8VupbD8GzgXhgqDjyhreeabxeD9ni1YU4O2VUt6qG9I4HbwQcIdHaW4ZIOkSKxgNd1KrsGxLSzIiFf2xHNbAcoqW66Pz2y_IJ9lqk-Vt-t77YET5iGdDl9Nw1&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R,https://www.facebook.com/955751467785034/posts/5891744090852389,https://twitter.com/RealJaguarKenya/status/1537277991906050048","Kenyan lawmaker Charles Njagua aka Jaguar ‘moving to Azimio’?

Ruto has promised him a cabinet position,” it reads.UDA is the United Democratic Alliance, led by Ruto. The deputy president is running for the presidency, with his main rival Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga.And a statement by Kabogo’s Tujibebe Wakenya Party denying that the politician had dropped out of the governor race was also posted on Facebook – stamped “FAKE”. In late 2021 Kabogo reportedly “withdrew his interest in running for president”. But has he also dropped his bid for governor of Kiambu, the county north of Nairobi?We checked. ‘Well-programmed propaganda’ The Tujibebe Wakenya Party statement is not fake. It was posted on the party’s verified Twitter account on 7 April. Twitter verifies pages that have been proven to be genuine.“It has come to our attention that there are reports from social media platforms stating that [Kabogo] has withdrawn his candidacy for the gubernatorial seat in the August 2022 elections,” the statement reads.“The [party secretariat] wishes to state that this is false information and well programmed propaganda directed at our party leader. [Kabogo] is the Tujibebe Party Kiambu County Gubernatorial Candidate in the August 9th 2022 elections.”Philomena Kabogo, Kabogo’s wife, posted the statement on Facebook the same day, urging people to “ignore the fake news”. Kabogo weighed in on 20 April. “I am optimistic that I will win the governorship in Kiambu so that we can finish the great work that we started and then I can go for Presidency from there,” he reportedly said.And on 5 June, Kenya’s electoral commission cleared Kabogo to vie for the Kiambu governor’s seat. Ten days later, he was on the campaign trail when he had a widely reported altercation with senator Kimani Wamatangi, a rival for the governorship.Kabogo is still running for governor of Kiambu county.","https://www.facebook.com/honkabogo,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiambu+County,+Kenya/@-1.0761227,36.334373,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x182f3660b2f136cf:0xe68cc409a8dd1e69!8m2!3d-1.0313701!4d36.8680791,https://www.facebook.com/kanyangogithae/posts/353629756789994,https://twitter.com/WilliamsRuto,https://www.facebook.com/kanyangogithae/posts/353629756789994,https://www.facebook.com/sirMm001/posts/1040006323541404,https://www.facebook.com/kanyangogithae/posts/353629756789994,https://www.facebook.com/mzalendo.mzalendo.1/posts/1602919953426196,https://www.facebook.com/mzalendo.mzalendo.1/posts/1602919953426196,https://www.facebook.com/mzalendo.mzalendo.1/posts/1602919953426196,https://uda.ke/site/,https://odm.co.ke/,https://twitter.com/RailaOdinga,https://tujibebeparty.com/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=353634183456218&set=p.353634183456218&type=3,https://www.pd.co.ke/inside-politics/kabogo-withdraws-from-running-for-president-in-2022-107709,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nairobi,+Kenya/@-1.3029436,35.7265091,8z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x182f1172d84d49a7:0xf7cf0254b297924c!8m2!3d-1.2920659!4d36.8219462,https://twitter.com/Tujibebeparty/status/1512100175157907469,https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts,https://twitter.com/Tujibebeparty/status/1512100175157907469,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=377207091081109&set=pb.100063754628387.-2207520000..&type=3,https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/central/2022-04-20-kabogo-denies-quitting-kiambu-governor-race-for-cs-post/,https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/central/2022-04-20-kabogo-denies-quitting-kiambu-governor-race-for-cs-post/,https://twitter.com/StandardKenya/status/1533458290633482240,https://www.citizen.digital/news/drama-as-wamatangi-kabogo-clash-at-kenya-kwanza-rally-in-kiambu-n300218",Kenyan politician Kabogo still running for Kiambu county governorship,,,,,,

We checked.No military coup in NigeriaIn 2018 president Muhammadu Buhari declared 12 June Democracy Day in Nigeria in honour of Moshood Abiola, the winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election. Buhari’s 12 June 2022 address to Nigerians was televised and reported by local news organisations. This would not have been possible if a coup had taken place.A search of the Nigerian army’s website and Twitter handle returned no result that the military had staged a coup or taken over the government. We also looked at the website of the country’s Independent National Electoral Commission and its social media handles. We found no evidence that political parties or activities have been suspended. And the biggest sign that the statement was fabricated is that there were no reports in Nigeria’s mainstream media or the international press, as you would expect if it were true.Nigeria transitioned from military to civilian rule in 1999 and since then there have been five successive general elections.

The caption reads: “Let me quietly address the elephant in the room and go back to what I do best. Thank you see you at work!” In the video, Iyke says the claim began to do the rounds online after bloggers got hold of photos of him in a movie, shot in Ghana, based on religious fanaticism.

I believe in one God but I have no intention now not ever to convert my faith,” he says.“I respect all religions and I have no intention of ever converting my faith.
