France’s independent press is proof of its adherence to international law, given that freedom of expression is a fundamental human right enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Article 19 reads: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.Charlie Hebdo is an independent magazine that routinely depicts world leaders, policymakers, financial magnates, show business stars, and historic and religious figures of various faiths in satirical and often controversial cartoons, French government officials and public personalities included.According to Charlie Hebdo’s director, “Riss” Laurent Sourisseau, the magazine published cartoons of the ayatollah on January 4, in honor of its 12 colleagues, including eight cartoonists, assassinated in a January 7, 2015, attack on the publication’s office in Paris.“It was one way of showing our support for the Iranian men and women risking their lives to defend their freedom against the theocracy oppressing them since 1979,” Sourisseau wrote in an editorial.Asked about the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s comments, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price said that “freedom of expression is a value, it is a universal right that we protect, we uphold, we promote the world over, whether that’s in France, whether that’s in Iran, whether that’s anywhere in between.”French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said Iran should look at what is going on at home before criticizing her nation.""Let's remember that in France press freedom exists contrary to what's happening in Iran and that this (freedom) is overseen by a judge within the framework of an independent judiciary, which is something that Iran without doubt doesn't know well,"" she said, adding that there were no blasphemy laws in France,” the Reuters news agency quoted Colonna as saying on January 5.Demonstrators take part in the Iran solidarity rally in London, Britain January 8, 2023. (REUTERS/Dylan Martinez)Iran has been facing growing international criticism for repression against protesters taking part in mass rallies that erupted in September after the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, while in the custody of the morality police for allegedly failing to properly cover her hair with a hijab.The regime has forcibly cracked down on protesters demanding basic rights and freedoms. Hundreds have been killed, allegedly by the police, while thousands have detained and arrested. Some of those have been sentenced to death and executed.Around 40 Iranian journalists have been imprisoned for covering the protests.In December, Iran was expelled from the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women for “systematic oppression” of women's rights.In 2020, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Charlie Hebdo’s cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad “revealed the hatred and hostility” of the “Western world” against Islam.Many Muslims consider such depictions of the prophet as blasphemous.In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strongman in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, organized mass protests in his capital city of Grozny, threatening to punish Charlie Hebdo for its cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad.";https://www.voanews.com/a/charlie-hebdo-attack-victims-honored-as-iran-rages-over-new-cartoons-/6909080.html,ttps://en.irna.ir/news/84993318/Charlie-Hebdo-cartoons-clear-case-of-hate-speech-Iran-FM-Spox,http://nations-united.org/Universal_Declaration_Of_Human_Rights/Articles_Human_Rights/Articles_19_Human_Rights_Universal_Declaration_Nations_United_Nineteen.htm,https://qz.com/322550/charlie-hebdo-has-had-more-legal-run-ins-with-christians-than-with-muslims,https://theweek.com/articles/531501/charlie-hebdo-attacks-show-that-not-all-blasphemies-are-equal,https://abo.charliehebdo.fr/common/product-article/985,https://abo.charliehebdo.fr/common/product-article/985,https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-january-4-2023/#post-408486-IRANFRANCE,ttps://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-01-05/no-lessons-to-take-from-iran-over-press-judicial-freedoms-france,https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/iran-protests-explained,https://www.voanews.com/z/5422,https://www.voanews.com/a/media-iran-arrests-journalist-who-interviewed-inmates-families/6907032.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/iran-ousted-un-womens-rights-commission-rcna61710,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-charlie-hebdo/6742580.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-chechnya-kadyrov-sanctions/6742212.html;False and Furious: Iran’s Reaction to Charlie Hebdo’s Ayatollah Khamenei Cartoons;;;;;;

(Sakchai Lalit/AP)He acknowledged that confusing Taiwan and Thailand is a “sensitive topic for many.” Ripley added that his Hong Kong-based CNN colleague, Kristie Lu Stout, who took part in the live broadcast, “would never confuse” Thailand and Taiwan.He attributed the graphics and footage errors to “technical problems,” saying live TV is “tricky.”But China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying used CNN’s broadcasting gaffes to attack U.S. Taiwan policy.Hua tweeted a screenshot of one of the mistakes. That image showed New Year’s fireworks, with a graphic identifying the location as “Bangkok, Taiwan.”Bangkok, of course, is Thailand’s capital, not Taiwan’s.""Seems a bit of geography and history lesson is in order for those who vow to defend Taiwan but really don't have a clue where it is,” Hua wrote.CNN, like any media company, is fair game for criticism. But it is misleading for a Chinese government spokesperson to seize on mistakes made by a privately-owned cable news channel to criticize U.S. government policy.First, some background on U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan.On September 18, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden told CBS television’s ""60 Minutes” program that U.S. forces would defend democratically-governed Taiwan if China launched an “unprecedented attack.”That upset Beijing, which says Taiwan is part of China under the so-called ""One China Policy.”Washington recognizes the communist government in Beijing as “the sole legal government of China,” but only acknowledges “Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China.” The U.S. does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty.Tensions ratcheted up on August 2, 2022, when then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan to, in her words, “honor America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”China reacted fiercely to that visit, carrying out live fire drills and other military maneuvers in the sea and air around Taiwan.Then U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi attends a meeting with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei on August 3, 2022. (Taiwan Presidential Office/ via Reuters)But what does that have to do with CNN’s New Year’s Eve broadcast?China, like other authoritarian regimes, regularly treats Western media as uniformly representing the interests of the U.S. government.In fact, U.S. media outlets (like others in “the West”) have a variety of funding and ownership structures, not to mention editorial lines. Voice of America (VOA), for example, is part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the U.S. government agency that oversees all non-military, U.S. international broadcasting. However, a legal firewall prohibits political interference in VOA’s reporting.As Polygraph.info previously noted, China’s attacks on Western media often appear based on the assumption (or deliberate misrepresentation) that they function like Chinese state media.In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered state-run media to strictly follow the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership and focus on ""positive reporting.”“All news media run by the Party must work to speak for the Party's will and its propositions and protect the Party's authority and unity,” China’s state-run Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying.Xi further called for “Marxist journalistic education” to be “promoted among journalists.”Some in China frame Western media as being “fundamentally biased against China,” often because of critical reporting on Tibet, Xinjiang, human rights concerns and other issues sensitive to the CCP.Hua’s statement indicates a belief that CNN, a private company, functions like Chinese-state media.In this case, the CNN broadcast’s mistakes were not made by the reporters on air.Ripley was broadcasting from outside Taipei 101, Taiwan’s tallest building, where a fireworks show was held. Stout was broadcasting from Hong Kong. In a video clip posted to Twitter by Ripley, Stout tells Ripley: “I know you’re in Taipei, we’re talking about Bangkok now,” as the New Year had just arrived in the Thai capital, which is one hour behind Taipei and Hong Kong.That may have contributed to the production errors during the broadcast.Both reporters discussed their experiences in Bangkok, and they named local landmarks in the Thai capital. Stout specifically referenced the King Power Mahanakhon skyscraper as a good location from which to view New Year’s fireworks in the Thai capital. Ripley cited another skyscraper’s rooftop cocktail bar, Sky Bar.Still, Andy Boreham, a columnist for China’s state-run Shanghai Daily newspaper, replied to Ripley’s Twitter post, writing: “Yet No excuses, Will — I guarantee you could never point to both places on a blank map.”In a glowing profile, the CCP-controlled newspaper Global Times said Boreham has “a great passion to showcase the real China.” It added that his “Reports on China” YouTube series “conveys factual stories in China and analyzes how Western media sources distort such coverage.”Twitter labels Boreham ""China state-affiliated media.”Meantime, Russia treats Western media in a similar way. Russian state broadcaster RT (formerly Russia Today) regularly highlights mistakes made by CNN.Several examples can be seen here, here and here.In its “ultimate guide” to “mainstream” media, RT wrote: “CNN’s worldview can best be deciphered from studying the speeches of Hillary Clinton.”Russian President Vladimir Putin had a notoriously contentious view of Clinton, formerly a secretary of state, U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential contender. Clinton is now a private citizen, although it is unclear if the RT guide was written while Clinton was still in government.But while CNN is privately owned and operated, RT actually functions like a mouthpiece of the Kremlin.In a January 2022 report, the U.S. State Department said RT and its sister organization, Sputnik, use “the guise of conventional international media outlets to provide disinformation and propaganda support for the Kremlin’s foreign policy objectives.”The report added that “Russian government officials and the outlets’ leadership have openly discussed RT and Sputnik’s role as tools of state propaganda.”";https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4767846 ,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-taipei-arrival-plane/ ,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reacts-fiercely-to-pelosi-s-taiwan-visit-/6686365.html,https://www.usagm.gov/rumors-myths-untruths/ ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-journalists-smear-campaign/6743320.html ,https://english.cctv.com/2016/02/20/ARTIETAE83T9c35nT9T3qq3k160220.shtml,https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-11/International_media_coverage_of_China.pdf ,https://twitter.com/AndyBxxx/status/1610165900644323330,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202212/1281270.shtml,https://www.rt.com/news/481613-cnn-germany-italy-border/,https://www.rt.com/usa/207963-cnn-blunders-map-mosque/,https://www.rt.com/news/233327-cnn-ukraine-russia-annex/,https://msm.rt.com/#usa/tv/cnn,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39334757,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kremlin-Funded-Media_January_update-19.pdf;China Deceptively Uses CNN’s New Year’s Eve Taiwan/Thailand Mix-up to Blast U.S.;;;;;;
2;;;;Misleading;Andrey Rudenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-exaggerates-china-s-support-/6906113.html;Russia Exaggerates China’s Support;2023-01-06;polygraph;;"In an interview with Russia’s TASS state news agency, published on January 3, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said China entirely agrees with how Russia is defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity:""Russian-Chinese cooperation is experiencing the best period in its history, bilateral relations ... are built on a solid foundation ... of mutual support in matters affecting each other's fundamental interests. First of all, we are talking about the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity."" That is misleading. China does not support Russia's territorial claims to the five Ukrainian regions it has partially occupied, including Crimea. Beijing has not provided Russia with weapons in its war with Ukraine and has been forced to partially participate in the Western sanctions against Russia.China and Russian annexations In February 2014, Russia occupied Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, and, after a referendum deemed illegal under Ukrainian law, the Kremlin declared Crimea a Russian territory.On March 15, 2014, the United Nations Security Council considered a resolution to invalidate the results of Russia’s disputed referendum in Crimea, which was planned for the following day, March 16, and reaffirmed Ukraine's “sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.” Fifteen council members voted in favor of the measure. Russia opposed it and China abstained.On March 27, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution “calling upon states not to recognize changes in status of Crimea region.” One hundred countries supported the resolution, Russia and 10 other countries rejected it, and China abstained along with 57 other U.N. members. On April 16, 2021, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Yenin wrote on Facebook that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had confirmed that China continued to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine:""The key thing is that the government of China does not recognize Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea and has informed the country's central and regional authorities about a ban on contacts with the peninsula's occupation authorities."" On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seriously escalating the conflict that began in Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. Following internationally rejected referendums in September, Russia announced it had annexed four partially occupied Ukrainian regions - Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.On October 12, 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on countries not to recognize Russia's referendums and illegal attempt to annex the four Ukrainian regions, with 143 member states voting in favor. Russia voted against it, as did four other authoritarian states - Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua and Syria. China and 34 other countries abstained. China and Russia's arms shortage Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Beijing has repeatedly said it does not and will not supply Moscow with weapons. This position is widely attributed to U.S. pressure on China.On March 17, 2022, the eve of U.S. President Joe Biden's video meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that one of the main U.S. messages to Xi would be that the U.S. would punish China if Beijing provided military aid to Russia.Three days after the video call between the two leaders, China's Ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang unequivocally denied that China would provide military assistance to Russia.“There's a disinformation about China providing military assistance to Russia,” he told CBS News' “Face the Nation.”“We reject that. … Not weapons and ammunition to any party and we are against a war, as I said, you know, we will do everything to deescalate the crisis.” On June 30, the Reuters news agency, citing an anonymous senior U.S. official, reported that the U.S. had not seen China dodge sanctions or supply weapons to Russia.""China is not providing material support,” a senior Biden administration official told the news agency on condition of anonymity. “We have not seen the [People's Republic of China] engage in systematic evasion or provide military equipment to Russia.""According to U.S. officials, as of December 30, 2022, Beijing had not provided material support to Russia's war against Ukraine.China and pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine  As the major Western economies responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with unprecedented coordinated sanctions, China and India became the primary buyers of Russian oil. As a result, Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China's top supplier of crude oil. But Reuters, citing trade sources, reported that Chinese refineries reduced purchases of Russian crude in anticipation of the European Union’s bans on the import of Russian oil and refined petroleum products.The EU’s ban on Russian oil imports came into effect on December 5, 2022, and its ban on refined Russian petroleum products is set to come into effect on February 5, 2023. More than 1,000 Western companies have left Russia since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese companies are also pulling out or have put their activities in Russia on hold. In December, China’s telecommunications and smartphone giant, Huawei, said it was disbanding its enterprise business team in Russia ""in further pullback amid Western sanctions.""The Kyiv School of Economics reported on December 26, in its weekly digest on the impact of foreign companies’ exit from Russia, that:- “The Chinese car manufacturer Lifan stopped selling new cars on the Russian market, not selling a single car in 2022.- drone company DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine… to try to keep drones out of the conflict.- payment system UnionPay has limited work with Russian acquirer banks that are under sanctions.- the TikTok social networking application suspended the access of users from Russia to conducting live broadcasts and posting new content.”";https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1846332/,https://usun.usmission.gov/explanation-of-vote-on-a-third-committee-resolution-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-crimea-and-the-city-of-sevastopol-ukraine/,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/how-russia-invaded-ukraine-in-2014-and-how-the-markets-tanked.html,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/16/readout-president-s-call-president-putin ,https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464002-un-security-council-action-crimea-referendum-blocked,https://press.un.org/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm,https://www.facebook.com/eugene.enin/posts/10215064078034875,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202205/t20220507_10683086.html ,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3228896-china-confirms-nonrecognition-of-attempted-annexation-of-crimea-and-ban-on-contacts-with-occupation-authorities.html,https://www.cna.org/our-media/indepth/2022/04/putins-invasion-of-ukraine-and-china-russia-relations,https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-feb-24/6456721.html,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-signs-documents-to-unlawfully-claim-4-ukrainian-regions-in/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/united-nations-condemns-russias-move-annex-parts-ukraine-2022-10-12/,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/russia-ukraine-annexation-un-vote-00061558,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/ukraine-war-joe-biden-to-warn-xi-jinping-china-will-face-costs-if-it-helps-russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/russia-china-weapons.html,https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1504684051915026433?s=20&t=8Lxj7ONdYLhXS9Tyf8znSQ,https://www.newsweek.com/china-russia-military-equipment-ukraine-invasion-america-biden-warnings-xi-jinping-1689938 ,https://www.reuters.com/world/china-not-giving-material-support-russias-war-ukraine-us-official-2022-07-01/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-says-russia-expects-chinas-xi-make-state-visit-spring-2022-12-30/,https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-says-russia-expects-chinas-xi-make-state-visit-spring-2022-12-30/,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-refiners-slow-down-russian-oil-purchases-sanctions-near-trade-2022-11-14/,https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2022/12/28/russian-wildberries-shows-tech-companies-increasingly-domestic-less-foreign/?sh=e530d656ebdf,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3177524/aliexpress-russia-said-be-laying-employees-amid-risks-secondary,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3203995/huawei-disbands-enterprise-business-team-russia-further-pullback-amid-western-sanctions-local-media,https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/33rd-issue-of-the-weekly-digest-on-impact-of-foreign-companies-exit-on-rf-economy/;Russia Exaggerates China’s Support;;;;;;

Igor Konashenkov said: “As a result of strikes by high-precision weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces on the temporary deployment points of ‘Foreign Legion’ units in the areas of the settlements of Markovo [and] Kramatorsk [in] the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as Novoosinovo [in] the Kharkiv region, more than 70 foreign mercenaries were killed, more than 100 wounded.” On January 3, TASS quoted Konashenkov as saying there had been more such strikes:“More than 130 foreign mercenaries were destroyed by high-precision strikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces [on] the temporary deployment points of the Foreign Legion units in the areas of the settlements of Maslyakovka and the city of Kramatorsk [in] the Donetsk People's Republic.” The ministry’s numbers are likely false.First, it did not provide any details or evidence to back up its numbers. Second, international media have not reported such massive casualties. Ukraine says more than 20,000 foreign volunteers from some 52 countries have answered President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s call to come and help Ukraine fight Russian forces since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion last February.“Russian claims of hundreds of foreign volunteers killed daily are absurdly high,” said Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy Seal and author of “SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama Bin Laden,” a New York Times bestseller.Polygraph.info asked Pfarrer, who closely monitors the situation in Ukraine and maintains contacts with the Americans and other foreign volunteers fighting there, to assess the Russian Defense Ministry’s claims about the death toll among the international volunteer troops in Ukraine.“International volunteers make up only about 6% of Ukrainian forces—and a significant percentage of international volunteers do not serve in front line units, but in other capacities. About five-to-10 international volunteer casualties are reported on social media per week — and reported casualties are three times as likely to be wounded as killed,” Pfarrer said. The Russian Defense Ministry’s claims followed a devastating New Year’s Day HIMARS strike by Ukrainian forces in the town of Makiivka. Ukraine said that strike killed some 400 Russian troops.The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the strike the following day and said it had killed 63 Russian troops. On January 4, the ministry raised the death toll to 89 troops.On January 1, Reuters reported that while it couldn’t verify how many Russian troops were killed in the Makiivka attack, the Russian Defense Ministry’s numbers have been challenged by Russian journalists and lawmakers, who insisted the real death toll was higher.Considering the backdrop of the Makiivka attack, “General Konashenkov might be engaging in revenge fantasies” by claiming that hundreds of foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine were killed during January 2-3, Pfarrer said.“Official Russian accounts of Ukrainian / international casualties are suspect because an accurate count would presume that Russia had captured significant swaths of territory, second, that Ukrainian soldiers had abandoned their dead on the battlefield and third, that recovered bodies carried passports or other documents to indicate that they were foreign volunteers,” Pfarrer said. “Russian gains have been small, and Ukraine has been scrupulous about recovering their dead and wounded. Russia’s claims are greatly exaggerated,” he noted.The Russian Defense Ministry has previously made similar overstated claims about strikes on foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine. On December 24, Konashenkov claimed Russian troops in Ukraine had killed 150 foreign volunteers. On November 25, he asserted that more than 100 foreigners were killed, and before that, on August 9, he said 335 foreigner volunteers were killed. None of these casualty figures have been confirmed independently.In March, Russia claimed it had killed 180 foreign volunteers in a single attack on a training camp in Yavoriv. The New Yorker magazine reported the attack was indeed a “bloodbath” that killed Ukrainian troops, but not foreigners.Harvard International Review reported that most foreigners fighting in Ukraine are doing so for ideological reasons, not for the money. And, unlike the mercenaries of Russia’s Wagner private military company, Ukraine’s international defenders are embedded with the Ukrainian army as a foreign legion, and some units are even integrated with regular Ukrainian troops.“The contract that international fighters sign with the government in Kyiv makes them Ukrainian soldiers and grants them the same benefits accorded to local troops: medical care, a base salary of about $1,200 a month [with additional pay for hazardous duty], and legal-combatant status under the Geneva Conventions,” The New Yorker reported on December 26, 2022.Russia routinely brands the foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine as “foreign mercenaries” in order to exclude them from the protections guaranteed under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Harvard International Review reported last September.;https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16733855,https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16736841,https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-do-gromadyan-inozemnih-derzhav-yaki-pragnut-dopom-73213 ,https://forceblueteam.org/bio/chuck-pfarrer/,https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250014719/sealtargetgeronimo,https:// https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/3/makiivka-attack-explainer,https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16733843,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/03/russia-makiivka-soldiers-killed-blame/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-shells-donetsks-makiivka-hitting-military-quarters-officials-2023-01-01/ ,https://www.tatar-inform.ru/news/minoborony-zayavilo-ob-unictozenii-svodnoi-gruppy-inostrannyx-naemnikov-v-dnr-5891062 ,https://lenta.ru/news/2022/11/25/inostr_legio/ ,https://www.interfax.ru/world/855893 ,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/trapped-in-the-trenches-in-ukraine ,https://hir.harvard.edu/the-latest-in-a-long-line-ukraines-international-legion-and-a-history-of-foreign-fighters/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-russias-wagner-group-bought-north-korean-weapons-ukraine-war-2022-12-22/ ,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/trapped-in-the-trenches-in-ukraine,https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm ;Russia’s Fantasy Revenge for Ukraine’s HIMARS Attack on Makiivka;;;;;;

(Dave Martin/AP)The envoy said the United States was pursuing its plans while al-Qaida was carrying out its assigned missions as a “proxy.”“Americans brought Daesh to Afghanistan,” Kazemi-Qomi said, using an acronym for Islamic State, adding the U.S. sought to pursue its plans there through its occupation and its military presence.""Iran's revisionist history claims that al-Qaida came to Afghanistan ‘after’ its cell attacked the U.S. mainland on 9/11 (from its terror bases located in eastern Afghanistan's Pashtun belt) are completely untethered from reality and patently false,” Brian Glyn Williams, author of “Counter Jihad. The American Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria,” told Polygraph.info.The U.S. and its allies launched their invasion of Afghanistan with the goal of neutralizing al-Qaida and its co-founder, Osama bin Laden, who helped mastermind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.“The world knows that Osama bin Laden and his followers arrived in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1996 after they were expelled from Sudan under joint U.S., Egyptian and Saudi pressure on the Turabi host government,” Williams said. He was referring to the-then government of Hassan al-Turabi in Sudan.“In 1996, Taliban leader Mullah Omar granted bin Laden and al-Qaida melmastiia, or sanctuary, and bin Laden swore bayah (an oath of loyalty to Mullah Omar as the Commander of the Faithful) in 1998.”From there, members of al-Qaida made their presence, and intentions against the U.S., known.“Bin Laden and his No. 2, Ayman al Zawahiri, were regularly filmed by al-Qaida operatives and interviewed in their Afghan bases at Khalden, and Al Farouq, by the world media from 1996 to 2001. For example, in 1996, ‘97 and ‘98, bin Laden issued his infamous televised ‘fatwas’ or decrees calling for attacks on the American ‘Far Enemy’ from his terror camps in eastern Afghanistan,” Williams said.He added that the 9/11 hijackers were also filmed at al-Qaida bases in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.In October 1999, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1267, creating the so-called al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee.That resolution linked ""the two groups as terrorist entities"" and imposed ""sanctions on their funding, travel, and arms shipments,” the Council on Foreign Relations said.The measure also called on the Taliban to hand over bin Laden to the “appropriate authorities.” Bin Laden had been indicted by the U.S. earlier that year for conspiring to kill U.S. citizens.Al-Qaida has been implicated in a number of terrorist attacks targeting the U.S., including the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 224 people and injured 4,500 others.The Taliban also provided al-Qaida with a base that it used to organize the 9/11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people on U.S. soil.Prior to the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council demanded that the Taliban hand over bin Laden.The Taliban put forward conditions for handing bin Laden over to a “third country,” which the U.S. rejected.While the U.S. quickly toppled the Taliban, two decades of insurgency and reconstruction efforts followed. The U.S. ultimately signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020.A Taliban fighter holds a poster of late Afghan leader of the Haqqani network Jalaluddin Haqqani, while chanting victory slogans at the Ahmad Shah Massoud Square near the US embassy in Kabul on August 15, 2022. (Wakil Kohsar/AFP)Williams said Iran’s “absurd” claim that the U.S. is carrying out its plans in Afghanistan using al-Qaida as a “proxy” shows a poorly informed view “on the geopolitics of countries on their own borders.”“The fact is that the U.S.-led war effort in Afghanistan, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, ended in 2014 and the last remaining 2,000 ‘light footprint’ support troops, who were supporting Afghan National Army troops as part of Operation Resolute Support, were disastrously withdrawn from Afghanistan in August 2021. There is no U.S. ‘occupation’ of Afghanistan, that job now belongs to the Taliban,” he said.In August 2021, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the U.S. government's leading oversight authority on Afghanistan reconstruction, released a report that raised critical questions about the U.S. mission there.Still, claims that al-Qaida is a U.S. proxy are belied by successful efforts to weaken the terror group.As noted in a report from the Brookings Institution research group in Washington, D.C. noted:“Although al-Qaida has fighters in Afghanistan, its ability to launch international terrorist attacks from there and from Pakistan, where the core organization has been based for almost 20 years, is limited. Al-Qaida core members haven’t successfully attacked the U.S. homeland since 9/11, despite numerous attempts, and have also been ineffective against Europe in the past decade.”The U.S. has also eliminated top-ranking al-Qaida members.“It seems the Iranian Press TV did not get the news that the American CIA killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al- Zawahiri, who was living in Taliban- controlled Kabul in direct contradiction of a Taliban agreement with the U.S., with a so-called Predator drone ‘Ninja bomb’ strike on his home in August 2022. Hardly the sort of treatment a country metes out to ‘proxies’ it ‘assigns missions to,’” Williams said.The U.S. killed bin Laden a decade earlier - at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011.Outside of Afghanistan, the U.S. also successfully (and controversially) killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who served as an al-Qaida spokesperson, and Abu Yahya al-Libi, another top al-Qaida leader.An April 2022 report by the U.N.’s monitoring team in Afghanistan said, ""The relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaida remains close.”That report added that member state assessments suggest al-Qaida “has a safe haven under the Taliban and increased freedom of action.”As for Islamic State, Polygraph.info has previously debunked similar Russian disinformation attempting to link the U.S. to the militant group’s branch in Afghanistan, called Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K).The actual history of combat between the U.S. and Islamic State, including longtime U.S. efforts to eradicate ISIS-K and its leadership in Afghanistan, are well-documented.";https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15082633,https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html,https://www.state.gov/24th-anniversary-of-the-1998-embassy-bombings/,https://www.911memorial.org/visit/memorial/names-911-memorial,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5,https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/lessonslearned/SIGAR-21-46-LL.pdf,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/05/04/dont-expect-an-al-qaida-reboot-in-afghanistan/,https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N22/333/77/PDF/N2233377.pdf?OpenElement,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check--fresh-russian-disinfo-falsely-claims-u-s-u-k-are-backing-islamic-state-in-afghanistan/6825373.html;Forget Iran’s Lies: Al-Qaida No U.S. ‘Proxy’ in Afghanistan;;;;;;

France’s independent press is proof of its adherence to international law, given that freedom of expression is a fundamental human right enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Article 19 reads: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.Charlie Hebdo is an independent magazine that routinely depicts world leaders, policymakers, financial magnates, show business stars, and historic and religious figures of various faiths in satirical and often controversial cartoons, French government officials and public personalities included.According to Charlie Hebdo’s director, “Riss” Laurent Sourisseau, the magazine published cartoons of the ayatollah on January 4, in honor of its 12 colleagues, including eight cartoonists, assassinated in a January 7, 2015, attack on the publication’s office in Paris.“It was one way of showing our support for the Iranian men and women risking their lives to defend their freedom against the theocracy oppressing them since 1979,” Sourisseau wrote in an editorial.Asked about the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s comments, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price said that “freedom of expression is a value, it is a universal right that we protect, we uphold, we promote the world over, whether that’s in France, whether that’s in Iran, whether that’s anywhere in between.”French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said Iran should look at what is going on at home before criticizing her nation.""Let's remember that in France press freedom exists contrary to what's happening in Iran and that this (freedom) is overseen by a judge within the framework of an independent judiciary, which is something that Iran without doubt doesn't know well,"" she said, adding that there were no blasphemy laws in France,” the Reuters news agency quoted Colonna as saying on January 5.Demonstrators take part in the Iran solidarity rally in London, Britain January 8, 2023. (REUTERS/Dylan Martinez)Iran has been facing growing international criticism for repression against protesters taking part in mass rallies that erupted in September after the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, while in the custody of the morality police for allegedly failing to properly cover her hair with a hijab.The regime has forcibly cracked down on protesters demanding basic rights and freedoms. Hundreds have been killed, allegedly by the police, while thousands have detained and arrested. Some of those have been sentenced to death and executed.Around 40 Iranian journalists have been imprisoned for covering the protests.In December, Iran was expelled from the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women for “systematic oppression” of women's rights.In 2020, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Charlie Hebdo’s cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad “revealed the hatred and hostility” of the “Western world” against Islam.Many Muslims consider such depictions of the prophet as blasphemous.In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strongman in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, organized mass protests in his capital city of Grozny, threatening to punish Charlie Hebdo for its cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad.";https://www.voanews.com/a/charlie-hebdo-attack-victims-honored-as-iran-rages-over-new-cartoons-/6909080.html,ttps://en.irna.ir/news/84993318/Charlie-Hebdo-cartoons-clear-case-of-hate-speech-Iran-FM-Spox,http://nations-united.org/Universal_Declaration_Of_Human_Rights/Articles_Human_Rights/Articles_19_Human_Rights_Universal_Declaration_Nations_United_Nineteen.htm,https://qz.com/322550/charlie-hebdo-has-had-more-legal-run-ins-with-christians-than-with-muslims,https://theweek.com/articles/531501/charlie-hebdo-attacks-show-that-not-all-blasphemies-are-equal,https://abo.charliehebdo.fr/common/product-article/985,https://abo.charliehebdo.fr/common/product-article/985,https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-january-4-2023/#post-408486-IRANFRANCE,ttps://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-01-05/no-lessons-to-take-from-iran-over-press-judicial-freedoms-france,https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/iran-protests-explained,https://www.voanews.com/z/5422,https://www.voanews.com/a/media-iran-arrests-journalist-who-interviewed-inmates-families/6907032.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/iran-ousted-un-womens-rights-commission-rcna61710,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-charlie-hebdo/6742580.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-chechnya-kadyrov-sanctions/6742212.html;False and Furious: Iran’s Reaction to Charlie Hebdo’s Ayatollah Khamenei Cartoons;;;;;;

(Sakchai Lalit/AP)He acknowledged that confusing Taiwan and Thailand is a “sensitive topic for many.” Ripley added that his Hong Kong-based CNN colleague, Kristie Lu Stout, who took part in the live broadcast, “would never confuse” Thailand and Taiwan.He attributed the graphics and footage errors to “technical problems,” saying live TV is “tricky.”But China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying used CNN’s broadcasting gaffes to attack U.S. Taiwan policy.Hua tweeted a screenshot of one of the mistakes. That image showed New Year’s fireworks, with a graphic identifying the location as “Bangkok, Taiwan.”Bangkok, of course, is Thailand’s capital, not Taiwan’s.""Seems a bit of geography and history lesson is in order for those who vow to defend Taiwan but really don't have a clue where it is,” Hua wrote.CNN, like any media company, is fair game for criticism. But it is misleading for a Chinese government spokesperson to seize on mistakes made by a privately-owned cable news channel to criticize U.S. government policy.First, some background on U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan.On September 18, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden told CBS television’s ""60 Minutes” program that U.S. forces would defend democratically-governed Taiwan if China launched an “unprecedented attack.”That upset Beijing, which says Taiwan is part of China under the so-called ""One China Policy.”Washington recognizes the communist government in Beijing as “the sole legal government of China,” but only acknowledges “Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China.” The U.S. does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty.Tensions ratcheted up on August 2, 2022, when then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan to, in her words, “honor America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”China reacted fiercely to that visit, carrying out live fire drills and other military maneuvers in the sea and air around Taiwan.Then U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi attends a meeting with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei on August 3, 2022. (Taiwan Presidential Office/ via Reuters)But what does that have to do with CNN’s New Year’s Eve broadcast?China, like other authoritarian regimes, regularly treats Western media as uniformly representing the interests of the U.S. government.In fact, U.S. media outlets (like others in “the West”) have a variety of funding and ownership structures, not to mention editorial lines. Voice of America (VOA), for example, is part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the U.S. government agency that oversees all non-military, U.S. international broadcasting. However, a legal firewall prohibits political interference in VOA’s reporting.As Polygraph.info previously noted, China’s attacks on Western media often appear based on the assumption (or deliberate misrepresentation) that they function like Chinese state media.In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered state-run media to strictly follow the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership and focus on ""positive reporting.”“All news media run by the Party must work to speak for the Party's will and its propositions and protect the Party's authority and unity,” China’s state-run Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying.Xi further called for “Marxist journalistic education” to be “promoted among journalists.”Some in China frame Western media as being “fundamentally biased against China,” often because of critical reporting on Tibet, Xinjiang, human rights concerns and other issues sensitive to the CCP.Hua’s statement indicates a belief that CNN, a private company, functions like Chinese-state media.In this case, the CNN broadcast’s mistakes were not made by the reporters on air.Ripley was broadcasting from outside Taipei 101, Taiwan’s tallest building, where a fireworks show was held. Stout was broadcasting from Hong Kong. In a video clip posted to Twitter by Ripley, Stout tells Ripley: “I know you’re in Taipei, we’re talking about Bangkok now,” as the New Year had just arrived in the Thai capital, which is one hour behind Taipei and Hong Kong.That may have contributed to the production errors during the broadcast.Both reporters discussed their experiences in Bangkok, and they named local landmarks in the Thai capital. Stout specifically referenced the King Power Mahanakhon skyscraper as a good location from which to view New Year’s fireworks in the Thai capital. Ripley cited another skyscraper’s rooftop cocktail bar, Sky Bar.Still, Andy Boreham, a columnist for China’s state-run Shanghai Daily newspaper, replied to Ripley’s Twitter post, writing: “Yet No excuses, Will — I guarantee you could never point to both places on a blank map.”In a glowing profile, the CCP-controlled newspaper Global Times said Boreham has “a great passion to showcase the real China.” It added that his “Reports on China” YouTube series “conveys factual stories in China and analyzes how Western media sources distort such coverage.”Twitter labels Boreham ""China state-affiliated media.”Meantime, Russia treats Western media in a similar way. Russian state broadcaster RT (formerly Russia Today) regularly highlights mistakes made by CNN.Several examples can be seen here, here and here.In its “ultimate guide” to “mainstream” media, RT wrote: “CNN’s worldview can best be deciphered from studying the speeches of Hillary Clinton.”Russian President Vladimir Putin had a notoriously contentious view of Clinton, formerly a secretary of state, U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential contender. Clinton is now a private citizen, although it is unclear if the RT guide was written while Clinton was still in government.But while CNN is privately owned and operated, RT actually functions like a mouthpiece of the Kremlin.In a January 2022 report, the U.S. State Department said RT and its sister organization, Sputnik, use “the guise of conventional international media outlets to provide disinformation and propaganda support for the Kremlin’s foreign policy objectives.”The report added that “Russian government officials and the outlets’ leadership have openly discussed RT and Sputnik’s role as tools of state propaganda.”";https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4767846 ,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-taipei-arrival-plane/ ,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reacts-fiercely-to-pelosi-s-taiwan-visit-/6686365.html,https://www.usagm.gov/rumors-myths-untruths/ ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-journalists-smear-campaign/6743320.html ,https://english.cctv.com/2016/02/20/ARTIETAE83T9c35nT9T3qq3k160220.shtml,https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-11/International_media_coverage_of_China.pdf ,https://twitter.com/AndyBxxx/status/1610165900644323330,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202212/1281270.shtml,https://www.rt.com/news/481613-cnn-germany-italy-border/,https://www.rt.com/usa/207963-cnn-blunders-map-mosque/,https://www.rt.com/news/233327-cnn-ukraine-russia-annex/,https://msm.rt.com/#usa/tv/cnn,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39334757,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kremlin-Funded-Media_January_update-19.pdf;China Deceptively Uses CNN’s New Year’s Eve Taiwan/Thailand Mix-up to Blast U.S.;;;;;;

First of all, we are talking about the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity."" That is misleading. China does not support Russia's territorial claims to the five Ukrainian regions it has partially occupied, including Crimea. Beijing has not provided Russia with weapons in its war with Ukraine and has been forced to partially participate in the Western sanctions against Russia.China and Russian annexations In February 2014, Russia occupied Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, and, after a referendum deemed illegal under Ukrainian law, the Kremlin declared Crimea a Russian territory.On March 15, 2014, the United Nations Security Council considered a resolution to invalidate the results of Russia’s disputed referendum in Crimea, which was planned for the following day, March 16, and reaffirmed Ukraine's “sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.” Fifteen council members voted in favor of the measure. Russia opposed it and China abstained.On March 27, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution “calling upon states not to recognize changes in status of Crimea region.” One hundred countries supported the resolution, Russia and 10 other countries rejected it, and China abstained along with 57 other U.N. members. On April 16, 2021, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Yenin wrote on Facebook that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had confirmed that China continued to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine:""The key thing is that the government of China does not recognize Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea and has informed the country's central and regional authorities about a ban on contacts with the peninsula's occupation authorities."" On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seriously escalating the conflict that began in Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. Following internationally rejected referendums in September, Russia announced it had annexed four partially occupied Ukrainian regions - Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.On October 12, 2022, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on countries not to recognize Russia's referendums and illegal attempt to annex the four Ukrainian regions, with 143 member states voting in favor. Russia voted against it, as did four other authoritarian states - Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua and Syria. China and 34 other countries abstained. China and Russia's arms shortage Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Beijing has repeatedly said it does not and will not supply Moscow with weapons. This position is widely attributed to U.S. pressure on China.On March 17, 2022, the eve of U.S. President Joe Biden's video meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that one of the main U.S. messages to Xi would be that the U.S. would punish China if Beijing provided military aid to Russia.Three days after the video call between the two leaders, China's Ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang unequivocally denied that China would provide military assistance to Russia.“There's a disinformation about China providing military assistance to Russia,” he told CBS News' “Face the Nation.”“We reject that. … Not weapons and ammunition to any party and we are against a war, as I said, you know, we will do everything to deescalate the crisis.” On June 30, the Reuters news agency, citing an anonymous senior U.S. official, reported that the U.S. had not seen China dodge sanctions or supply weapons to Russia.""China is not providing material support,” a senior Biden administration official told the news agency on condition of anonymity. “We have not seen the [People's Republic of China] engage in systematic evasion or provide military equipment to Russia.""According to U.S. officials, as of December 30, 2022, Beijing had not provided material support to Russia's war against Ukraine.China and pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine  As the major Western economies responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with unprecedented coordinated sanctions, China and India became the primary buyers of Russian oil. As a result, Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China's top supplier of crude oil. But Reuters, citing trade sources, reported that Chinese refineries reduced purchases of Russian crude in anticipation of the European Union’s bans on the import of Russian oil and refined petroleum products.The EU’s ban on Russian oil imports came into effect on December 5, 2022, and its ban on refined Russian petroleum products is set to come into effect on February 5, 2023. More than 1,000 Western companies have left Russia since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese companies are also pulling out or have put their activities in Russia on hold. In December, China’s telecommunications and smartphone giant, Huawei, said it was disbanding its enterprise business team in Russia ""in further pullback amid Western sanctions.""The Kyiv School of Economics reported on December 26, in its weekly digest on the impact of foreign companies’ exit from Russia, that:- “The Chinese car manufacturer Lifan stopped selling new cars on the Russian market, not selling a single car in 2022.- drone company DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine… to try to keep drones out of the conflict.- payment system UnionPay has limited work with Russian acquirer banks that are under sanctions.- the TikTok social networking application suspended the access of users from Russia to conducting live broadcasts and posting new content.”";https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1846332/,https://usun.usmission.gov/explanation-of-vote-on-a-third-committee-resolution-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-crimea-and-the-city-of-sevastopol-ukraine/,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/how-russia-invaded-ukraine-in-2014-and-how-the-markets-tanked.html,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/16/readout-president-s-call-president-putin ,https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464002-un-security-council-action-crimea-referendum-blocked,https://press.un.org/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm,https://www.facebook.com/eugene.enin/posts/10215064078034875,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202205/t20220507_10683086.html ,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3228896-china-confirms-nonrecognition-of-attempted-annexation-of-crimea-and-ban-on-contacts-with-occupation-authorities.html,https://www.cna.org/our-media/indepth/2022/04/putins-invasion-of-ukraine-and-china-russia-relations,https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-feb-24/6456721.html,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-signs-documents-to-unlawfully-claim-4-ukrainian-regions-in/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/united-nations-condemns-russias-move-annex-parts-ukraine-2022-10-12/,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/russia-ukraine-annexation-un-vote-00061558,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/ukraine-war-joe-biden-to-warn-xi-jinping-china-will-face-costs-if-it-helps-russia,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/russia-china-weapons.html,https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1504684051915026433?s=20&t=8Lxj7ONdYLhXS9Tyf8znSQ,https://www.newsweek.com/china-russia-military-equipment-ukraine-invasion-america-biden-warnings-xi-jinping-1689938 ,https://www.reuters.com/world/china-not-giving-material-support-russias-war-ukraine-us-official-2022-07-01/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-says-russia-expects-chinas-xi-make-state-visit-spring-2022-12-30/,https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-says-russia-expects-chinas-xi-make-state-visit-spring-2022-12-30/,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-refiners-slow-down-russian-oil-purchases-sanctions-near-trade-2022-11-14/,https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2022/12/28/russian-wildberries-shows-tech-companies-increasingly-domestic-less-foreign/?sh=e530d656ebdf,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3177524/aliexpress-russia-said-be-laying-employees-amid-risks-secondary,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3203995/huawei-disbands-enterprise-business-team-russia-further-pullback-amid-western-sanctions-local-media,https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/33rd-issue-of-the-weekly-digest-on-impact-of-foreign-companies-exit-on-rf-economy/;Russia Exaggerates China’s Support;;;;;;

Igor Konashenkov said: “As a result of strikes by high-precision weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces on the temporary deployment points of ‘Foreign Legion’ units in the areas of the settlements of Markovo [and] Kramatorsk [in] the Donetsk People's Republic, as well as Novoosinovo [in] the Kharkiv region, more than 70 foreign mercenaries were killed, more than 100 wounded.” On January 3, TASS quoted Konashenkov as saying there had been more such strikes:“More than 130 foreign mercenaries were destroyed by high-precision strikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces [on] the temporary deployment points of the Foreign Legion units in the areas of the settlements of Maslyakovka and the city of Kramatorsk [in] the Donetsk People's Republic.” The ministry’s numbers are likely false.First, it did not provide any details or evidence to back up its numbers. Second, international media have not reported such massive casualties. Ukraine says more than 20,000 foreign volunteers from some 52 countries have answered President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s call to come and help Ukraine fight Russian forces since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion last February.“Russian claims of hundreds of foreign volunteers killed daily are absurdly high,” said Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy Seal and author of “SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama Bin Laden,” a New York Times bestseller.Polygraph.info asked Pfarrer, who closely monitors the situation in Ukraine and maintains contacts with the Americans and other foreign volunteers fighting there, to assess the Russian Defense Ministry’s claims about the death toll among the international volunteer troops in Ukraine.“International volunteers make up only about 6% of Ukrainian forces—and a significant percentage of international volunteers do not serve in front line units, but in other capacities. About five-to-10 international volunteer casualties are reported on social media per week — and reported casualties are three times as likely to be wounded as killed,” Pfarrer said. The Russian Defense Ministry’s claims followed a devastating New Year’s Day HIMARS strike by Ukrainian forces in the town of Makiivka. Ukraine said that strike killed some 400 Russian troops.The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the strike the following day and said it had killed 63 Russian troops. On January 4, the ministry raised the death toll to 89 troops.On January 1, Reuters reported that while it couldn’t verify how many Russian troops were killed in the Makiivka attack, the Russian Defense Ministry’s numbers have been challenged by Russian journalists and lawmakers, who insisted the real death toll was higher.Considering the backdrop of the Makiivka attack, “General Konashenkov might be engaging in revenge fantasies” by claiming that hundreds of foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine were killed during January 2-3, Pfarrer said.“Official Russian accounts of Ukrainian / international casualties are suspect because an accurate count would presume that Russia had captured significant swaths of territory, second, that Ukrainian soldiers had abandoned their dead on the battlefield and third, that recovered bodies carried passports or other documents to indicate that they were foreign volunteers,” Pfarrer said. “Russian gains have been small, and Ukraine has been scrupulous about recovering their dead and wounded. Russia’s claims are greatly exaggerated,” he noted.The Russian Defense Ministry has previously made similar overstated claims about strikes on foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine. On December 24, Konashenkov claimed Russian troops in Ukraine had killed 150 foreign volunteers. On November 25, he asserted that more than 100 foreigners were killed, and before that, on August 9, he said 335 foreigner volunteers were killed. None of these casualty figures have been confirmed independently.In March, Russia claimed it had killed 180 foreign volunteers in a single attack on a training camp in Yavoriv. The New Yorker magazine reported the attack was indeed a “bloodbath” that killed Ukrainian troops, but not foreigners.Harvard International Review reported that most foreigners fighting in Ukraine are doing so for ideological reasons, not for the money. And, unlike the mercenaries of Russia’s Wagner private military company, Ukraine’s international defenders are embedded with the Ukrainian army as a foreign legion, and some units are even integrated with regular Ukrainian troops.“The contract that international fighters sign with the government in Kyiv makes them Ukrainian soldiers and grants them the same benefits accorded to local troops: medical care, a base salary of about $1,200 a month [with additional pay for hazardous duty], and legal-combatant status under the Geneva Conventions,” The New Yorker reported on December 26, 2022.Russia routinely brands the foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine as “foreign mercenaries” in order to exclude them from the protections guaranteed under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Harvard International Review reported last September.;https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16733855,https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16736841,https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-do-gromadyan-inozemnih-derzhav-yaki-pragnut-dopom-73213 ,https://forceblueteam.org/bio/chuck-pfarrer/,https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250014719/sealtargetgeronimo,https:// https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/3/makiivka-attack-explainer,https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/16733843,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/03/russia-makiivka-soldiers-killed-blame/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-shells-donetsks-makiivka-hitting-military-quarters-officials-2023-01-01/ ,https://www.tatar-inform.ru/news/minoborony-zayavilo-ob-unictozenii-svodnoi-gruppy-inostrannyx-naemnikov-v-dnr-5891062 ,https://lenta.ru/news/2022/11/25/inostr_legio/ ,https://www.interfax.ru/world/855893 ,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/trapped-in-the-trenches-in-ukraine ,https://hir.harvard.edu/the-latest-in-a-long-line-ukraines-international-legion-and-a-history-of-foreign-fighters/ ,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-russias-wagner-group-bought-north-korean-weapons-ukraine-war-2022-12-22/ ,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/trapped-in-the-trenches-in-ukraine,https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm ;Russia’s Fantasy Revenge for Ukraine’s HIMARS Attack on Makiivka;;;;;;

(Dave Martin/AP)The envoy said the United States was pursuing its plans while al-Qaida was carrying out its assigned missions as a “proxy.”“Americans brought Daesh to Afghanistan,” Kazemi-Qomi said, using an acronym for Islamic State, adding the U.S. sought to pursue its plans there through its occupation and its military presence.""Iran's revisionist history claims that al-Qaida came to Afghanistan ‘after’ its cell attacked the U.S. mainland on 9/11 (from its terror bases located in eastern Afghanistan's Pashtun belt) are completely untethered from reality and patently false,” Brian Glyn Williams, author of “Counter Jihad. The American Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria,” told Polygraph.info.The U.S. and its allies launched their invasion of Afghanistan with the goal of neutralizing al-Qaida and its co-founder, Osama bin Laden, who helped mastermind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.“The world knows that Osama bin Laden and his followers arrived in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1996 after they were expelled from Sudan under joint U.S., Egyptian and Saudi pressure on the Turabi host government,” Williams said. He was referring to the-then government of Hassan al-Turabi in Sudan.“In 1996, Taliban leader Mullah Omar granted bin Laden and al-Qaida melmastiia, or sanctuary, and bin Laden swore bayah (an oath of loyalty to Mullah Omar as the Commander of the Faithful) in 1998.”From there, members of al-Qaida made their presence, and intentions against the U.S., known.“Bin Laden and his No. 2, Ayman al Zawahiri, were regularly filmed by al-Qaida operatives and interviewed in their Afghan bases at Khalden, and Al Farouq, by the world media from 1996 to 2001. For example, in 1996, ‘97 and ‘98, bin Laden issued his infamous televised ‘fatwas’ or decrees calling for attacks on the American ‘Far Enemy’ from his terror camps in eastern Afghanistan,” Williams said.He added that the 9/11 hijackers were also filmed at al-Qaida bases in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.In October 1999, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1267, creating the so-called al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee.That resolution linked ""the two groups as terrorist entities"" and imposed ""sanctions on their funding, travel, and arms shipments,” the Council on Foreign Relations said.The measure also called on the Taliban to hand over bin Laden to the “appropriate authorities.” Bin Laden had been indicted by the U.S. earlier that year for conspiring to kill U.S. citizens.Al-Qaida has been implicated in a number of terrorist attacks targeting the U.S., including the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 224 people and injured 4,500 others.The Taliban also provided al-Qaida with a base that it used to organize the 9/11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people on U.S. soil.Prior to the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council demanded that the Taliban hand over bin Laden.The Taliban put forward conditions for handing bin Laden over to a “third country,” which the U.S. rejected.While the U.S. quickly toppled the Taliban, two decades of insurgency and reconstruction efforts followed. The U.S. ultimately signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020.A Taliban fighter holds a poster of late Afghan leader of the Haqqani network Jalaluddin Haqqani, while chanting victory slogans at the Ahmad Shah Massoud Square near the US embassy in Kabul on August 15, 2022. (Wakil Kohsar/AFP)Williams said Iran’s “absurd” claim that the U.S. is carrying out its plans in Afghanistan using al-Qaida as a “proxy” shows a poorly informed view “on the geopolitics of countries on their own borders.”“The fact is that the U.S.-led war effort in Afghanistan, known as Operation Enduring Freedom, ended in 2014 and the last remaining 2,000 ‘light footprint’ support troops, who were supporting Afghan National Army troops as part of Operation Resolute Support, were disastrously withdrawn from Afghanistan in August 2021. There is no U.S. ‘occupation’ of Afghanistan, that job now belongs to the Taliban,” he said.In August 2021, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the U.S. government's leading oversight authority on Afghanistan reconstruction, released a report that raised critical questions about the U.S. mission there.Still, claims that al-Qaida is a U.S. proxy are belied by successful efforts to weaken the terror group.As noted in a report from the Brookings Institution research group in Washington, D.C. noted:“Although al-Qaida has fighters in Afghanistan, its ability to launch international terrorist attacks from there and from Pakistan, where the core organization has been based for almost 20 years, is limited. Al-Qaida core members haven’t successfully attacked the U.S. homeland since 9/11, despite numerous attempts, and have also been ineffective against Europe in the past decade.”The U.S. has also eliminated top-ranking al-Qaida members.“It seems the Iranian Press TV did not get the news that the American CIA killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al- Zawahiri, who was living in Taliban- controlled Kabul in direct contradiction of a Taliban agreement with the U.S., with a so-called Predator drone ‘Ninja bomb’ strike on his home in August 2022. Hardly the sort of treatment a country metes out to ‘proxies’ it ‘assigns missions to,’” Williams said.The U.S. killed bin Laden a decade earlier - at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011.Outside of Afghanistan, the U.S. also successfully (and controversially) killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who served as an al-Qaida spokesperson, and Abu Yahya al-Libi, another top al-Qaida leader.An April 2022 report by the U.N.’s monitoring team in Afghanistan said, ""The relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaida remains close.”That report added that member state assessments suggest al-Qaida “has a safe haven under the Taliban and increased freedom of action.”As for Islamic State, Polygraph.info has previously debunked similar Russian disinformation attempting to link the U.S. to the militant group’s branch in Afghanistan, called Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K).The actual history of combat between the U.S. and Islamic State, including longtime U.S. efforts to eradicate ISIS-K and its leadership in Afghanistan, are well-documented.";https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15082633,https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html,https://www.state.gov/24th-anniversary-of-the-1998-embassy-bombings/,https://www.911memorial.org/visit/memorial/names-911-memorial,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5,https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/lessonslearned/SIGAR-21-46-LL.pdf,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/05/04/dont-expect-an-al-qaida-reboot-in-afghanistan/,https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N22/333/77/PDF/N2233377.pdf?OpenElement,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check--fresh-russian-disinfo-falsely-claims-u-s-u-k-are-backing-islamic-state-in-afghanistan/6825373.html;Forget Iran’s Lies: Al-Qaida No U.S. ‘Proxy’ in Afghanistan;;;;;;

(State Emergency Service of Ukraine/via Reuters)On December 20, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin said the creation of the tribunal without Russia’s participation would be “legal nonsense.”""These countries, in their Russophobic fervor, are ready to openly violate the U.N. Charter … to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states,” Vershinin alleged.“The European Union, which participates in multi-billion-dollar financing and arms supplies to Ukraine, in this way is trying to cover their own involvement in mass cases of war crimes committed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.”Vershinin’s claim is false. It fits into a long-used Russian disinformation tactic called projection —accusing others of doing what you are doing to deflect attention from your actions.Human rights groups and Ukrainian investigators have documented numerous crimes against civilians and civilian infrastructure allegedly committed by Russia in Ukraine since launching its invasion on February 24.The United Nations, international monitors, rights groups, and others have accused Russia of indiscriminately shelling and bombing populated areas, killing civilians and destroying hospitals, schools, and residential buildings.Russian forces are also reported to be systematically targeting Ukraine’s electricity and water supply, depriving Ukrainians of heat, electricity and water “to sow fear and despair” as winter sets in.The United Nations has also documented repeated attacks on Ukrainian cultural sites.A recent U.N. report alleged that the Russian armed forces had “summarily executed or carried out attacks on individuals leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians” in towns and villages across northern Ukraine from February 24 to April 6.Mass graves and evidence of atrocities have been found in decimated Ukrainian cities from which Russian forces have been forced out.An Associated Press investigation has largely supported Ukraine’s claims that Moscow has forcibly relocated thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia in a move analysts say could violate the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.Last month, the European Parliament designated Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.While both sides in the war have reportedly violated international humanitarian law, “Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, including war crimes,” the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the U.N. Human Rights Council, said in October.It is in this context that Ukraine is defending itself from external aggression, with support from the EU and other allies.Rescuers work at the site of a hospital's maternity ward destroyed by a Russian missile attack in Vilniansk on November 23, 2022. (Reuters)Yes, under international law, EU members could be held responsible for crimes committed with weapons they have transferred to Ukraine if certain conditions are met. But there is no evidence those conditions have been met.Writing for the Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies, Kevin Jon Heller, professor of international law and security at the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Military Studies, and Lena Trabucco, a postdoctoral researcher at the center, outline issues surrounding the legality of weapons transfers to Ukraine under international law.Heller and Trabucco say, “The shock and horror at Russia’s unprovoked invasion has led many Western states to supply Ukraine with a degree of military support unheard of since the American Lend-Lease Program in 1941.” They add that support to Ukraine “is both morally and politically justified.”But Western support does entail potential legal pitfalls.While their analysis focuses on five areas of international law, we’ll go right to the sections relevant to Vershinin’s allegations: that the EU is involved in war crimes by providing billions in military assistance to the armed forces of Ukraine.Heller and Trabucco reference Common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which “imposes a negative obligation on states to avoid encouraging, aiding, or assisting a specific violation of [International Humanitarian Law] by a party to an armed conflict.”This negative obligation would prohibit Western states from providing weapons to Ukraine ""if there is an expectation, based on facts or knowledge of past patterns, that such weapons would be used to violate the [Geneva] Conventions.”Heller and Trabucco note that there is no evidence to suggest that Ukrainian armed forces are systematically engaged in war crimes, however, there are credible reports that some units of the Ukrainian military may have committed war crimes. That includes “unlawfully executing Russian prisoners of war near the village of Dmitrovka, west of Kyiv,” and extensively using “cluster munitions in Husarivka while attempting to retake the town.”Heller and Trabucco argue nothing indicates Western arms delivered since Russia’s invasion were used to commit those alleged war crimes, “or that Ukraine is routinely committing war crimes.”“It is thus very unlikely that Common Article 1’s negative obligation limits the ability of any Western state to provide Ukraine with a particular type of weapon, much less weapons in general,” they argue.Heller and Trabucco also cite Article 16 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), adopted by the U.N. International Law Commission in 2001.Article 16 covers “aid or assistance in the commission of an internationally wrongful act.”Under Article 16, a state is “internationally responsible” for committing an internationally wrongful act if it “does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act.”But they argue Article 16 “is less likely to limit the ability of states to continue to provide weapons to Ukraine than Common Article 1,” as it would require that those states knew with “virtual certainty” Ukraine intended to use those arms to commit war crimes.“Even acknowledging that Ukraine has committed war crimes during its conflict with Russia, the infrequence of their commission means that, at present, Western states can be neither virtually certain that Ukraine intends to commit future war crimes nor virtually certain that Ukraine will commit those crimes with their weapons. Far more persistent and systematic criminality would be required to implicate [Article] 16.”Heller and Trabucco reference Article 25 of the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC).The ICC’s jurisdiction is limited to the most serious crimes: the crime of genocide; crimes against humanity; war crimes; and the crime of aggression.Article 25(3)(d) establishes criminal responsibility and liability for punishment for an individual who intentionally contributes “in any other way” to “the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose.”Heller and Trabucco then reiterate that there is no evidence Western arms have been involved in Ukrainian war crimes, adding that states “would need to reconsider future plans to provide weapons to Ukraine” if such evidence ever came to light.If states continued to supply arms after learning previous transfers had “facilitated criminal acts,” the government officials behind the transfers would risk being held criminally responsible under [Article] 25(3)(d) for any war crimes Ukraine used the weapons to commit.”Meantime, the chief prosecutor of The Hague-based ICC has pushed back against the proposed EU tribunal, arguing the ICC can handle war crimes committed in Ukraine.But Moscow halted the process of joining the ICC in 2016 (and thus does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction) following an ICC ruling, which recognized Russia’s actions on Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula as an occupation. Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014.The European Union has proposed establishing either a “special independent international court based on a multilateral treaty, or a specialized court integrated in a national justice system with international judges — a hybrid court,” to hold Russia accountable for its crimes.An earlier version of this article stated without qualification that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. The article has been amended to reflect that, while copious evidence of such crimes has been collected, none has been proven in a court of law.";https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/702574/EXPO_IDA(2022)702574_EN.pdf,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/04/bachelet-urges-respect-international-humanitarian-law-amid-growing-evidence,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/10/ukraine-russian-attacks-on-critical-energy-infrastructure-amount-to-war-crimes/,https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ukraine-over-150-cultural-sites-partially-or-totally-destroyed?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab20000d710fcce751c6273fa9567c31abef0607b2879dfe10a6a6d4b7b47034f2dc6e086a076c9a14300035a740849a3d89f12d7a78f6efa804f7ad24bc0bf75be25bd5a5cb222618c114be365941029bcd9bdd92b511460766cf,https://ukraine.un.org/en/210464-un-report-details-summary-executions-and-attacks-individual-civilians-russian-troops,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-europe-63536564&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777367053%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7nvQb9DHa6TNnAEYcsgAf4H8bN%2FhO%2BIfABAsHaWvj78%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.org%2Fen%2Flatest%2Fnews%2F2022%2F09%2Fukraine-mass-graves-in-izium-is-a-macabre-reminder-of-the-cost-of-russian-aggression%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777367053%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Cv53kHS5HneiEfNoJ97JVJvzKLyC9p%2Fu1onCk4bkos4%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fukraine-war-mass-graves-torture-and-broken-bodies-the-horrors-of-bucha-have-been-laid-bare-12582018&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777523266%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=dcL8b4zFGD%2FNxocz3DqLmEbNJWFIvkP8ZU1gWP2OJ1U%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Fukrainian-children-russia-7493cb22c9086c6293c1ac7986d85ef6&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777523266%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wBt4bHQzd8w8l9K%2BZJpkj%2Fyk67ANVIkzVBwIBe%2FWsAo%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lemonde.fr%2Fen%2Fopinion%2Farticle%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2Fdeporting-ukrainian-children-and-russifying-them-is-jeopardizing-the-future-of-ukraine_5992568_23.html&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777523266%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=0P9l5Zc%2Beq%2FCiBgXf6egChrmHM11RuCKFesGh%2F%2BHqB8%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.understandingwar.org%2Fbackgrounder%2Frussian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-23%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C755419efcca2414de42b08dae43ae0ad%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638073238777523266%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=vggSGTKAOSyca%2Bf%2FeekTn9lDhteWW06K7RDgch0%2FhwM%3D&reserved=0,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20221118IPR55707/european-parliament-declares-russia-to-be-a-state-sponsor-of-terrorism,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-has-found-array-war-crimes-violations-human-rights-and,https://brill.com/view/journals/ihls/aop/article-10.1163-18781527-bja10053/article-10.1163-18781527-bja10053.xml#fn000102,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/04/09/ukraine-s-military-accused-of-war-crimes-against-russian-troop_5980121_4.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/world/europe/ukraine-forces-cluster-munitions.html,https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf,https://brill.com/view/journals/ihls/aop/article-10.1163-18781527-bja10053/article-10.1163-18781527-bja10053.xml#fn000102,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crimes-netherlands-the-hague-ursula-von-der-leyen-9e83e1107064ef6e9c375576b998373a,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38005282,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-war-crimes-europe-european-union-0a5b8a172ce101064c1a6b9653d80a7a;Russia Projects Suspected War Crimes in Ukraine on European Union;;;;;;
11;;;;Misleading;Recep Tayyip Erdogan;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-erdogan-misleads-on-implications-of-imamoglu-s-political-ban-/6884609.html;Erdogan Misleads on Implications of Imamoglu’s Political Ban;2022-12-20;polygraph;;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied any suggestion a political ban on rival Ekrem Imamoglu would have an impact on the nation’s politics.Erdogan made his remarks in response to domestic and international criticism surrounding the recent conviction of Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul. The latter was accused of insulting public officials during a mayoral race in 2019. Imamoglu was sentenced last week to slightly more than two years and seven months in prison. He is expected to appeal. Additionally, a political ban could lead to his removal from office and prevent him from standing in elections set for next June.The U.S. Department of State said in a statement that it was “deeply troubled and disappointed” by the court’s verdict against the mayor. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that Imamoglu’s conviction “is inconsistent with respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.”Speaking in the southeastern capital city of Mardin on December 18, Erdogan said he had no influence on the court’s judgment and that the “trial continues” until a court of appeals weighs in. “What is behind the storm sparked by a verdict these past few days? This debate has nothing to do with me or with our nation.  There is neither a political discussion, nor a battle of ideas, nor a struggle for service,” Erdogan said.Those claims are misleading. Imamoglu’s prosecution has direct implications for Turkey, as the mayor of Istanbul is considered Erdogan’s top political rival and a projected front-runner in the presidential elections in June.“Secular and liberal” Imamoglu emerged as a “rising political star and the greatest rival to date of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,” the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a U.S.-based research group, (FDD) wrote in June 2019 after Imamoglu’s victory in the mayoral race over an Erdogan-favored candidate.Imamoglu won the mayoral elections in Istanbul twice: first in the original contest, then again in a re-run that Turkey’s Election Board ordered after it canceled the results of the first race, citing technical errors. The mayorship of Istanbul “challenged” Erdogan’s “air of invincibility” with the impressive electoral victory, according to the analysis, which also predicted the mayor would challenge Erdogan’s “ability to rule Turkey with an iron fist.” The FDD also predicted that Erdogan would use his power over Turkish courts in dealing with the challenge. “Erdogan has a track record of seizing municipalities and jailing political rivals – such as Selahattin Demirtas, the charismatic co-leader of the progressive Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) – on frivolous charges.”  Demonstrators shout slogans and wave Turkish national flags during a rally to oppose the conviction and political ban of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a popular rival to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, in Istanbul, December 15, 2022. (Umit Bektas/REUTER)Thus, Iamamoglu’s conviction on December 14 is based on the accusation that he insulted the Election Board by calling the members “fools” for ordering the 2019 re-do of the Istanbul mayoral election. Following the sentencing, Turkey’s High Election Board said that even if Imamoglu wins the case in the court of appeals, then runs and wins in the June presidential elections, he still may not be able to assume the presidency due to the political ban.“He may run in elections but cannot get his mandate as a president even if he wins,” Bloomberg reported on December 17, citing Muharrem Akkaya, the head of Turkey’s Supreme Electoral Council. In Istanbul, thousands rallied on December 15 in protest of the mayor’s conviction and political ban. Speaking to the crowd, Imamoglu promised to fight for the presidency.“You beat them two times already and you’ll do it again. All 16 million Istanbulites, our nation, and our big Turkey alliance is behind me. We will change this order in the election next year,” he said.Imamoglu is backed by an opposition alliance of six political parties. The so-called “Table of Six” was formed in 2021 to present a challenge to Erdogan’s AKP party in the 2023 election.Erdogan has been the president of Turkey since 2003. He has been criticized for legal reforms that critics say have transformed the country into an autocracy, including the imposition of strict religious regulations, tightening the government’s grip on the media and restricting free speech.;https://www.timesofisrael.com/erdogan-claims-he-had-no-role-in-conviction-of-istanbul-opposition-mayor/,https://news.yahoo.com/istanbul-mayor-convicted-insulting-turkish-150526097.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH0pTmDz2yfHsFljm_1UCc87363HRuYVwZVfR6Wyodue2f14XoITXvQJF9zWZ-ABSTeGKv1anZns_Ox7cIGvrY7sNZTxv6c-RzZdawWwAQi9_IjK7BpIMb3QT3gpDr9_IW5_HSVnmh3viDPoRk6QySzNJu4WNP6FfqB6MxPbuUvL,https://www.state.gov/turkeys-conviction-and-sentencing-of-istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu/,https://www.paturkey.com/news/erdogan-claims-he-has-no-influence-on-mayors-jail-sentence/2022/,https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/06/24/istanbuls-new-mayor-elect-emerges-as-top-erdogan-rival/,https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/06/24/istanbuls-new-mayor-elect-emerges-as-top-erdogan-rival/,https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/europe/2022/12/15/ekrem-imamoglu-erdogan-rival-istanbul-mayor-given-jail-term-and-political-ban/ ,https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/06/24/istanbuls-new-mayor-elect-emerges-as-top-erdogan-rival/,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fdd.org%2Fanalysis%2F2019%2F04%2F12%2Ferdogan-seizes-kurdish-municipalities-again%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7Ce4aad408995d4bf8877a08dae2ca1bda%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638071654941349327%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=EE9QyZfVRwRG%2BlHNiKExf3SDkk%2BD58AOwipA6iQsMnw%3D&reserved=0,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-turkey-security-kurds%2Fformer-head-of-turkey-pro-kurdish-party-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison-for-terrorist-propaganda-cnn-turk-idUSKCN1LN1K8&data=05%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7Ce4aad408995d4bf8877a08dae2ca1bda%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638071654941349327%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TRxsNsEpSMgB1oMuYRWWXIxZ8ykllmqPHBCENagNQ00%3D&reserved=0,https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/turkish-court-sentences-erdogan-rival-to-jail-with-political-ban/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu-sentenced-to-jail-over-fools-insult,https://news.yahoo.com/turkey-election-board-flags-risks-130801620.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-17/turkish-election-board-flags-risks-to-erdogan-rival-s-nomination?leadSource=uverify%20wall,https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/thousands-protest-in-turkey-over-istanbul-mayors-conviction/,https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-opposition-desperately-seeks-an-electable-leader/a-63109589,https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/88633?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss;Erdogan Misleads on Implications of Imamoglu’s Political Ban;;;;;;

As we can see – in fact, this is common knowledge – this plan has fallen through.”Putin and other Russian government officials routinely say they have nullified the sanctions’ negative effect on their country’s economy.Such claims distort the reality.The economic part of the sanctions targets vast sectors of Russia's economy. They are intended to signal that the West is unified in supporting Ukraine and limit the Kremlin’s ability to supply its war by reducing national resources and crippling foreign trade.Despite the temporary effects and possible backfiring of the restrictions, (more on this later) the sanctions in the long run are achieving their intended objectives.First imposed for Russia’s destabilizing of eastern Ukraine and annexing of the strategically located Black Sea Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the sanctions have been expanding since Moscow’s full-fledged military invasion on February 24.Speaking at a U.S. State Department briefing in August, experts with the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute said that the impact of sanctions on the Russian economy is “devastating.”Based on the data collected for a comprehensive study of the Russian economic outlook, the CELI study concluded: “From our analysis, it becomes clear: business retreats and sanctions are catastrophically crippling the Russian economy.”The study includes a list of some 1,100 private businesses that voluntarily pulled out of Russia in solidarity with Ukraine.“Until this, there’s nothing like this in world history to have 1,100 plus companies – multinational companies voluntarily pull out,” said Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.“Putin is thus continuing to drain his budget into his war in Ukraine,” he “may need to defund other international or domestic campaigns in the process” and “risks facing a financial predicament in which he will not be able to balance maximalist goals in Ukraine with his global power projection campaigns,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a December 12 report.Apart from declaring economic invincibility to the sanctions in his speech to the Council, Putin also proclaimed the Russian ruble “one of the world’s strongest currencies.”A one hundred rubles banknote is pictured in front of a one US dollar banknote. April 25, 2022. Russia's currency went down and up again since Russia's war in Ukraine and intensified Western sanctions. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)On the surface, Putin’s claim about the strength of the ruble appears to be accurate and confirmed by global financial market reports, at least for the first four months of 2022.Experts, however, say it is “simply not true,” as explained by Steven Tian of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute:“Putin loves to talk about the Russian ruble and how strong it is. That’s simply not true; it’s an artificial exchange rate. It’s a reflection of capital controls. Simply put, if you live in Russia right now, there is no legal way for you to obtain dollars. You can’t access dollar deposit accounts; you can’t buy dollars from the bank... And you can see the trading volume has plummeted across the ruble, showing that there’s a heavy premium being paid on the black market.” One of the measures Russia has taken to support its currency is telling the buyers of its natural gas to pay in rubles. In March, members of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, or G-7, declined the demand as “one-sided” and a “clear breach of existing contracts.”Russia has been using “the holes in the sanctions wall,” like Moscow’s ability to ensure a continued inflow of U.S. dollars by diverting its trade to the countries that did not join the sanctions, like China, India, and Turkey, an NPR story explained.Domestically, Moscow adopted a policy of restrictions including the requirement for Russian businesses to bring 80% of their money from overseas back to Russia, in rubles, and banning Russian brokers from selling securities owned by foreigners, thus stocking the money inside the country, and keeping the ruble from falling.Yet such “financial alchemy,” NPR said, is risky, as it only creates an illusion of strength, essentially creating “a Potemkin currency” – in a reference to the 18th century Russian government official who created fake villages to convince Empress Catherine of success.“The head of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, is essentially playing Potemkin to Putin's Catherine, using a range of tools to make the ruble look like a currency that has value when in fact very few people outside Russia want to buy a single ruble unless they absolutely have to and when many people inside Russia don't really want rubles either.” Moreover, the latest analysis by the Reuters news agency indicates that the efforts Russia put into creating the illusion of a strong ruble appear to be waning as the Russian currency hit a five-month low on December 15.The critics predict sanctions fatigue, saying that restrictions on Russian oil and gas add urgency to the European countries’ efforts to establish other energy sources. Plus, the dramatic reduction of Russian supplies prompted an energy crisis in Europe and boosted consumer prices.But there is a silver lining and a long-term benefit – analysts say freedom from dependency on Russian energy supplies gives Europe an opportunity to choose more reliable partners and focus on the transition to clean energy; it also deprives Moscow of further using its oil and gas for political blackmail.";http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70086,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-from-sputnik-a-gusher-of-disinfo-about-russian-crude/6858472.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-from-sputnik-a-gusher-of-disinfo-about-russian-crude/6858472.html,https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/russia-sanctions-framework ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/26/sanctions-russia-war-ukraine-putin-oligarchs ,https://www.state.gov/united-with-ukraine/ ,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/european-union-approves-new-sanctions-against-russia-over-ukraine-war ,https://www.state.gov/,https://som.yale.edu/story/0/chief-executive-leadership-institute-research-insights-business-retreats-and-sanctions-are ,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4167193 ,https://www.state.gov/,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-12,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-ruble-currency-russian-economy-sanctioms-2022/,https://www.state.gov/,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-ruble-gas-payments/31774413.html?utm_id=980516&orgid=1314&utm_att1=nprnews,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/04/05/1090920442/how-russia-rescued-the-ruble ,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/04/05/1090920442/how-russia-rescued-the-ruble ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-rouble-recovers-five-month-103719524.html ,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-countries-plan-gas-deals-replace-russian-fuel-draft-2022-12-14/,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/energy/europe-energy-2023-iea/index.html ,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariannelehnis/2022/11/25/which-european-renewable-energy-alternatives-will-dominate-in-the-long-term/?sh=10f581004201 ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gazprom-blackmail-backfires-eu-vows-141630219.html ;Putin’s Fictitious Optimism About Russian Economy;;;;;;

The meeting took place on December 7 in Paris, and covered a wide range of issues, from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to China’s efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.Lu tried to falsely portray protests that recently erupted in China against stringent pandemic-related lockdown measures as a “color revolution.”People hold white sheets of paper in protest of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions, after a vigil for the victims of a fire in Urumqi, as outbreaks of the coronavirus disease continue in Beijing, China, on November 27, 2022. (Thomas Peter/Reuters)Asked whether there had been progress in identifying the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, he dug up an old conspiracy theory.“In fact, as early as July (2019), the U.S. military's biolab in Fort Detrick was shut down following an accident,” he said.“Soon after that, cases of pneumonia emerged in the area. At the time, people did not know what disease that pneumonia was. Then the [former] head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted in Congress in March 2020 that those were COVID-19 cases.”Lu referenced the 2019 Military World Games held in Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in December of that year.“Five American military athletes fell ill and were picked up by an American charter plane,” he said. “It was October, and two months later, [COVID-19] cases were detected in Wuhan. We know that the novel coronavirus has an incubation period of at least two weeks. It’s unlikely that the virus had already existed in Wuhan and [infections] led to the U.S. underperformance in the Games. Is it even possible that the U.S. soldiers were infected as soon as they arrived in Wuhan?”Lu was then asked if he believed “the Americans brought COVID-19 to China.” He said, “[Y]ou can think for yourself and draw conclusions. I only provide facts.”Rather than “provide facts,” Lu repeated falsehoods and a conspiracy theory that has been thoroughly debunked by Polygraph.info and others.Opening ceremony of the 7th CISM Military World Games in Wuhan on October 18, 2019. (Reuters)Let’s take Lu’s claims point by point.First, in July 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for research to be halted at the U.S. Army lab at Fort Detrick, located in Frederick, Maryland, after safety concerns were raised over the institute’s chemical-based decontamination process.Published reports indicate no one was exposed to pathogens and nothing leaked outside of the facility. The lab fully reopened in March 2020.Lu then tried to link Fort Detrick with a rash of illnesses in the area. Chinese state media have previously raised suspicions over a respiratory disease outbreak in July 2019 at a Springfield, Virginia retirement community some 97 kilometers away from the U.S. Army facility.Health officials, however, tested specimens collected during that outbreak and found several bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and rhinovirus, “the cause of the common cold.”They did not find traces of COVID-19.What’s more, former CDC Director Robert Redfield never told the U.S. Congress those cases were linked to COVID-19.On March 11, 2022, during a U.S. House (of Representatives) Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on coronavirus response, then-California Democratic Representative Harley Rouda asked Redfield if it was possible that people in the United States who appeared to be dying from influenza were actually dying from COVID-19.Redfield said, “Some cases have actually been diagnosed in the United States that way today.”Redfield never said when or where those cases were documented and made no reference to Fort Detrick or any cases in the surrounding area.Next, there is no evidence five U.S. military athletes became ill at the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan and were flown back to the United States.Polygraph.info thoroughly covered this issue in August 2021, after Chinese state media attempted to spread that conspiracy theory.To recap, local Chinese media at that time reported on five foreign athletes becoming sick during the Games.On February 23, 2020, Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital (where the athletes were treated), told local media the incident “had nothing to do with COVID-19,” and speculation otherwise “doesn’t even deserve debunking.”Local media reported that two of the five sick athletes were from Africa, The nationalities of the other athletes did not come up, and no mention was made of American athletes.Screen grab from an online Chinese news portal, showing a photograph of an unidentified foreign athlete who received treatment at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital during the World Military Games in October 2019.China never provided evidence that the U.S. military scrambled planes to pick up sick athletes and return them to the U.S. for treatment prior to the Games coming to an end.Local media reported that two of the foreign athletes who fell ill expressed appreciation to hospital staff for their treatment, contradicting claims anyone was medically evacuated to another country. China has never provided medical records or passport information about the five athletes.Lu also said that as “the most powerful military” in the world,” it was “weird” the U.S. military athletes performed relatively poorly at the Games.“We can't say that because the virus had already appeared in Wuhan at that time, the United States did not get a good ranking in the military games. Could it be that American soldiers were infected as soon as they arrived in Wuhan?” Lu asked.Yes, the United States only received eight medals in the 2019 Military World Games, but that’s two more medals than the U.S. team received in either the 2015 Military World Games or the 2011 Military World Games.Why the U.S. underperforms at the Military World Games is a matter of discussion that has no relation to the origins of COVID-19.Meantime, investigations into the origins of COVID-19 continue. Debate still rages over whether COVID-19 emerged in nature and was transmitted from an animal to humans or was leaked from a lab.Many who believe COVID-19 is not natural in origin argue the virus which causes it leaked from the network of laboratories operated by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where SARS-related coronaviruses were studied. SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.China has vehemently denied that.On December 14, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed the need to understand how the pandemic began.“We continue to call on China to share the data and conduct the studies that we have requested, to better understand the origins of this virus,” Tedros said.“As I have said many times, all hypotheses remain on the table.”Tedros previously said China had withheld information from a WHO-led team dispatched to Wuhan in January-February 2021 to get to the bottom of the pandemic.China would later reject WHO calls to audit laboratories in Wuhan.;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russias-pravda-falsely-labels-chinese-protests-a-u-s-coup-/6854846.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/04/01/cdc-lifts-shutdown-order-army-biolabs-fort-detrick.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-disinfo-covid-19/6742435.html,https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/covid19/rumor-control,https://www.c-span.org/video/?470224-1/dr-fauci-warns-congress-coronavirus-outbreak-worse,https://www.polygraph.info/a/military-world-games-us-army-wuhan/6743108.html,https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-02-23/doc-iimxxstf3829555.shtml,https://www.tspweb.com/key/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%86%9B%E8%BF%90%E4%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Military_World_Games,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Military_World_Games,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/who-director-generals-opening-remarks-media-briefing-14-december-2022,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-china-report/data-withheld-from-who-team-probing-covid-19-origins-in-china-tedros-idUSKBN2BM26S;China’s Ambassador to France Dredges Up Debunked US Biolab COVID-19 Conspiracy;;;;;;

Nasr-Azadani was accused of belonging to an “armed group” that allegedly killed three security officers two days earlier, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).Iran’s state-run broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), identified the three slain security officers as Col. Esmaeil Cheraghi from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s powerful security force, and Mohammed Hossein Karimi and Mohsen Hamidi from the Basij, the IRGC volunteer arm that has cracked down on protesters.According to IranWire, a news site run by Iranian diaspora journalists and citizen journalists inside Iran, on November 20, IRIB released a video of forced confessions of three people accused of Cheraghi's death. IRIB said the three defendants’ names were published on social media following the video’s release, and that Nasr-Azadani was one of them.Nasr-Azadani has been charged with “rebellion, membership in illegal gangs, collusion to undermine security and therefore assisting in moharebeh,” Agence France-Press (AFP) reported on December 13, citing the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).The charge against Nasr-Azadani “could carry death penalty if proven that the accused had used a firearm, otherwise he could be sentenced to prison,” CNN reported, citing Iran’s penal code.However, on December 11, IranWire reported information that contradicts the allegations against Nasr-Azadani:“IranWire sources said that Nasr-Azadani had been present in some nationwide protests, but he was never present in the area where IRGC and Basij forces were killed. The source also said that his presence in the protests was short and limited to chanting slogans for a few hours.”Following Nasr-Azadani’s arrest, Iran’s security forces threatened members of the footballer’s family, telling them that if they talked about his arrest in public, he would be “issued the most severe sentence possible,” IranWire reported, citing one member of Nasr-Azadani’s family.IranWire said:“According to IranWire’s sources, the family was initially unaware of the reason for his arrest, as well as the judicial system's filing of a case to frame him for the involvement in the murder of three government forces. The family's efforts to be able to choose a lawyer for him were unsuccessful.”The source also told IranWire that after the family was informed of the charges, a government-appointed lawyer for Nasr-Azadani informed them that the charges were “only to cause fear,” but that “if the family members reacted and spoke to foreign media, the death sentence would become final.”The news outlet said that Nasr-Azadani's family “is still afraid of talking publicly or releasing news related to him.”“They think that by waiting and remaining silent, they may avoid the death sentence,” a source told IranWire.“The source said Nasr-Azadani had no role in the beating or killing of three government forces in Isfahan,” IranWire wrote.All the sources cited by IranWire were anonymous; speaking to journalists about sensitive or critical matters concerning the Islamist regime puts Iranian citizens at risk of persecution.If convicted, Nasr-Azadani would join 11 individuals who have been sentenced to death over the unrest and could be hanged “at any moment,” according to Amnesty International.“They include Mohammad Mehdi Karami, 21, arrested after attending a Nov. 3 mourning ceremony for a young protester killed in September, and Sahand Nourmohammad Zadeh, who is accused of tearing down highway railings and setting fire to rubbish bins and tires,” Bloomberg News reported.Amnesty International has identified 20 people “at risk of execution in connection with the protests.” Apart from the 11 known to have a death sentence, three have “undergone trials on capital charges and … are either at risk of being sentenced to death or may have already been sentenced to death, with no publicly available information on their status.”Six individuals “may be awaiting or undergoing trial on charges carrying the death penalty,” Amnesty said, Nasr-Azadani among them.FIFPRO, the international trade union for football players, said in a December 12 tweet that it was “shocked and sickened” by reports that Nasr-Azadani could face execution “after campaigning for women’s rights and basic freedom in his country.”Several prominent footballers, current and former, also expressed solidarity. “Do not execute Amir,” former Iranian national team player Ali Karimi said in a tweet directed at what he called Iran’s “child-killing” government.Oslo-based Iran Human Rights reported on December 7 that “at least 458 people including 63 children and 29 women have been killed” in 26 provinces in the first two months of the nation-wide protests. The organization noted that numerous incoming reports of deaths are still under investigation and its tally is “an absolute minimum,” with the actual death toll “certainly higher.”In a 486-page report, Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), affiliated with the U.S.-based rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran, documented the first 82 days of protests in Iran from September 17 to December 7.The report compiled “the identity of 481 deceased, including 68 children and teenagers, an estimated 18,242 arrested along with the identity of 3,670 arrested citizens, 605 students and 61 journalists or activists in the field of information…”Two 23-year old Iranians, Mohsen Shekari and Majidreza Rahnavard, were executed by public hanging on December 1 and December 5, respectively.“Shekari was accused of blocking traffic during protests and causing knife cuts to a member of Iran’s Islamic plainclothes militia. Rahnavard, who was executed just 12 days after the start of his trial, was accused of killing two members of the militia,” Bloomberg News reported.Some reports say arrested protesters have been tortured and coerced into making confessions.“The trials of those who are facing capital charges related to protests have been a total travesty of justice,” Tara Sepehri Far, senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch, said on December 13.“The defendants are reportedly tortured into confessing, deprived of access to lawyers of their choosing, and rushed through trial proceedings that bypass safeguards in Iran’s own penal code and criminal procedure law.”";https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23伊朗球员因支持女性将被处决%23,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/13/fifpro-sickened-by-iranian-footballer-death-sentence-reports,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/12/1131537,https://right groups,https://iranwire.com/en/politics/111162-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-in-danger-of-execution/,https://iranwire.com/en/politics/111162-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-in-danger-of-execution/,https://www.rokna.net/بخش-حادثه-245/845069-فیلم-لحظه-دستگیری-عاملان-شهادت-بسیجی-در-اصفهان,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-protests-executions-soccer-player-amir-nasr-azadani-risk-death-sentence/,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/middleeast/amir-nasr-azadani-iran-protests-fifpro-intl/index.html,https://iranwire.com/en/politics/111162-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-in-danger-of-execution/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/12/iran-public-execution-of-majidreza-rahnavard-exposes-authorities-revenge-killings/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/iran-protest-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-and-others-at-risk-of-execution,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/12/iran-public-execution-of-majidreza-rahnavard-exposes-authorities-revenge-killings/,https://twitter.com/alikarimi_ak8/status/1601625332314148865,https://iranhr.net/en/articles/5623/,https://www.en-hrana.org/a-comprehensive-report-of-the-first-82-days-of-nationwide-protests-in-iran/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/iran-protest-footballer-amir-nasr-azadani-and-others-at-risk-of-execution,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-forced-confessions-protesters-heavy-sentences-athletes/32176668.html,https://www.timesofisrael.com/activists-angry-at-forced-confession-of-iran-rapper-jailed-for-criticizing-regime/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/13/iran-death-sentences-against-protesters;Iran’s Embassy in China Misrepresents Case Against Footballer;;;;;;

Alexander Khudotioply/Reuters)The head of Russia's State Duma Defense Committee, Andrei Kartapolov, further played up “Washington’s military-biological programs” on December 5.""Despite the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the United States is the only country in the world that still has not completed getting rid of them,” Kartapolov said during at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a six-country alliance that includes Russia.“And, by the way, it has the newest technologies in service in this sphere.”That is false.While the United States has not yet fully eradicated its chemical weapons stockpile, it is not alone in possessing chemical weapons.Russia, which “officially” completed the destruction of its chemical weapons arsenal in 2017, maintains a chemical weapons capacity, and has actually deployed chemical weapons at home and abroad.The same goes for North Korea and Syria, which have close ties with Russia.The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) obliges state parties “to chemically disarm” by destroying all stockpiles they produced, including those “abandoned on the territory of other state parties.”Only four states – Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan – are not party to the convention, which is administered by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).Albania, India, Iraq, Libya, Syria, the United States, Russia and an anonymous state “widely believed to be South Korea,” all declared they had chemical weapons stockpiles when they joined the CWC, according to the Arms Control Association (ACA), a nonprofit that advocates for global arms control policies.All those countries except the United States have destroyed their declared arsenals. The key word is “declared,” which we’ll get to briefly.In August 2018, Paul F. Walker, director for environmental sustainability at Green Cross International, an environmental organization headquartered in Geneva, explained to Polygraph.info some of the technical complications in eliminating the U.S. stockpiles compared to Russia’s, which you can read here.It is also worth noting that the U.S. and Russia use different definitions of “destruction.” In the U.S. it is a complete process, while in Russia destruction does not include dealing with large volumes of highly toxic waste.The entrance to The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, Netherlands, April 20, 2017. (John Thys/AFP)Beyond that distinction, Russia and Syria clearly have maintained an undeclared chemical weapons capacity. And they have used it to deadly effect.Russia infamously employed the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in the March 2018 attack on former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, in Salisbury, England. The Skripals survived, but the attack resulted in the collateral poisoning death of British national Dawn Sturgess.Following the Salisbury attack, the OPCW added several Novichok agents to its list of Schedule 1 substances – chemicals which have little or no use outside of chemical warfare.Then, in August 2020, Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was poisoned with Novichok while traveling in Tomsk, Russia. An investigation by the news site Bellingcat and Russia’s The Insider (in cooperation with Der Spiegel and CNN) traced the attack to a team from Russia’s Federal Security Service.Although the Novichok variant used against Navalny was not included on the updated list of Schedule 1 substances, the OPCW told Polygraph.info in a written statement that “all toxic chemicals and their precursors, except when used for purposes permitted by the CWC in specified quantities, are chemical weapons,” and thus banned under the convention.In March, Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, told CNN that Russia’s use of Novichok “is a clear indicator that the Russian chemical weapons program has continued in some way.”Syria joined the CWC in September 2013. In January 2016, the OPCW confirmed that Damascus had destroyed all of its declared chemical weapons. Yet, the Syrian government has been linked to multiple chemical weapons attacks against its own people since declaring stockpiles destroyed.United Nation vehicles carrying the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors are seen in Damascus, Syria on April 18, 2018. (Ali Hashisho/Reuters)In July 2020, the OPCW said it had concluded “there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Republic used chemical weapons,” specifically chlorine and sarin gas, and condemned the use of those weapons.“[T]he use of such chemical weapons by the Syrian Arab Republic, by direct implication, establishes that the Syrian Arab Republic failed to declare and destroy all of its chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities, and demands that the Syrian Arab Republic immediately cease all use of chemical weapons,” the OPCW said.In April 2021, the OPCW suspended several of the Syrian Arab Republic’s rights and privileges due to those violations.Analysts believe North Korea has amassed large quantities of chemical and biological weapons and is capable of manufacturing thousands of tons of chemical weapons annually.North Korea has been implicated in the state-sponsored assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un, using VX, a deadly nerve agent that is odorless and tasteless.Soon after the attack at Kuala Lumpur airport, South Korean intelligence officials identified four of the suspects who flew out of Malaysia as North Korean spies.In 2018, a panel of U.N. experts concluded that North Korea was sending supplies to Syria that could help Damascus reestablish its chemical weapons program.The United States did produce tens of thousands of tons of chemical weapons from World War I to 1968 as a deterrent, according to the U.S. government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those weapons were never used in battle.In October, the OPCW’s director-general noted the “unprecedented efforts and progress of the United States to eliminate its chemical weapons stockpile.”He added that the “strong cooperation” of the U.S. “to support the OPCW’s verification at its chemical weapons destruction facilities strengthen the Organization’s efforts to permanently eradicate the scourge of chemical weapons.”The U.S. is slated to finish destroying its remaining chemical weapons stocks by September 2023. In April, the U.S. Defense Department said it had reached a milestone with destruction of the last rocket containing VX.";https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-foreign-ministry-attacks-u-s-over-chemical-weapons-stockpile-/6741901.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-biden-putin-killer-relations/6742864.html,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03686-y,https://www.rferl.org/a/everything-you-need-to-know-about-novichok/30964840.html,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/chemical-weapons-russia-what-matters/index.html,https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity,https://www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/07/ec94dec02(e).pdf,https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2021/04/conference-states-parties-adopts-decision-suspend-certain-rights-and,https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/north-korea-overview/,https://thebulletin.org/2017/06/sea-of-sarin-north-koreas-chemical-deterrent/,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39107796,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/world/asia/north-korea-syria-chemical-weapons-sanctions.html,https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/demil/history.htm,https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2022/10/opcw-director-general-meets-usas-deputy-assistant-secretary-defence ,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp,https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3036463/us-meets-milestone-in-chemical-weapons-stockpile-destruction/;Top Russian Misrepresents U.S. on Chemical Weapons, No Mention of Kremlin Poisoning Foes;;;;;;

Production plummeted. Conditions became so dire that people died in the streets. Some of the starving turned to cannibalism.Ukraine recognized the Holodomor as genocide in 2006. Since then, sixteen other countries have followed suit, including the United States. Argentina, Chile and Spain have declared it an “an act of extermination,” according to the Holodomor Museum in Kyiv.Responding to the Bundestag declaration, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed the Holodomor was caused by events beyond Soviet authorities’ control:“Its (the Holodomor) main reason was a large-scale crop failure. To a large extent, the famine was also promoted by Western countries, which demanded that the USSR pay with grain in foreign trade operations with them.”That is false. In fact, the overwhelming consensus among scholars is that the famine resulted from Stalin’s failed farming policies and brutal oppression of the peasant population. The word Holodomor derives from the Ukrainian holod (starvation) and mor (extermination).In 1929, the Soviet Communist Party under Stalin launched collectivization – the forced integration of individual land holdings and labor into state-controlled collective and state farms. The policy required farmers to rent their land, personal property and housing to state-controlled farms.Wealthy and dissenting peasants were sentenced to long terms of hard labor or executed. Some 5 million people were deported to Siberia. Food production dropped dramatically, shortages emerged and the peasants rebelled, sometimes violently.As noted by the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine, which is maintained by a team of scholars and editors from the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (CIUS), the resistance to Soviet collectivization was particularly strong in Ukraine:“In Soviet Ukraine, the scale of protests and riots, which reached their peak in early 1930, was greater than in the other Soviet republics. According to figures collected by the Unified State Political Administration (the OGPU — the Soviet secret police), 4,098 disturbances occurred in Soviet Ukraine (29.7 percent of the USSR total) with over a million participants (38.7 per cent of the USSR total), at a time when the republic accounted for about 20 percent of the USSR population.”Ukraine, as the center of grain production, was known as the Russian Empire’s breadbasket. Peasants in Ukraine were more affluent and didn’t want to give their property to the state. Also, many farmers had supported in efforts to create an independent Ukrainian state in 1917–1920, in resistance to the Bolsheviks who had engineered the communist revolution in Russia.Under collectivization, farmers in the Soviet Union had to fulfill mandatory grain quotas. The communist government used this grain to feed the country’s growing urban population and to finance the purchase of equipment from abroad, as part of the Soviet industrialization program.In 1930, for example, 22.3 million tons of grain were harvested in Ukraine. The state took 35 percent of the total – 7.7 million tons of grain. In 1931, Ukraine harvested 13.8 tons of grain, of which the state took 7.25 million tons, or 53 percent of the total.The small amount of grain that the state left for the farmers wasn’t enough to survive.On December 28, 1931, Karl Karlson, vice chairman of the GPU (secret police) of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), wrote in a top-secret report:“This year’s grain-procurement campaign is taking place in the context of widely held opinions that the plans are unrealistic and cannot be fulfilled…“In the village of Moskalivka in Vovchansk raion, a group of up to sixty collective farmers, mostly women, presented themselves in orderly fashion to the village council and demanded that bread be distributed. There were shouts: ‘Give us bread, we’re hungry’.""According to Bohdan Klid, research director at Canada’s Holodomor Research and Education Consortium, Ukraine’s food shortages were caused by the Soviet authorities’ confiscatory measures and unrealistically high grain quotas.Stalin cracked down:“When famine broke out in Ukraine … top Soviet Ukrainian government leaders informed the Kremlin of starvation, requesting aid and a reduction in the grain quota for the country. The Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, called instead for an intensification of grain collection efforts. He also voiced his distrust of Ukrainian officials, suspecting many of them as nationalists, and expressed fear that opposition to his policies in Ukraine could intensify, possibly leading to Ukraine’s secession from the Soviet Union.”In 1932, Ukrainian farmers again failed to meet the quotas. In response, authorities stepped up their requisitioning campaign, seizing even seeds, meat and potatoes. Special teams were sent to search the houses to confiscate grain and other foodstuffs.On August 7, 1932, the Soviets issued a decree known as the “Law of Five Spikelets,” under which the theft of even a few stalks of grain became an act of sabotage, punishable with death by firing squad. The entire harvest was declared “equivalent to state property.” To protect it, soldiers were placed on watchtowers so that no one could take even five spikelets.Starving rural inhabitants tried leaving their villages to find food, but the government issued a decree forbidding it. Thousands who managed to get away were detained and sent back. This meant they were effectively sentenced to death through starvation.In the early spring of 1933, British journalist Gareth Jones was able to travel from Moscow to Ukraine, even though Western journalists were forbidden from traveling outside the capital. Jones spent two weeks collecting evidence of the famine in Ukraine and wrote in an article published in the Manchester Guardian on March 29, 1933:“I walked alone through villages and twelve collective farms. Everywhere was the cry, ‘There is no bread; we are dying’. …In a train a Communist denied to me that there was a famine. I flung into the spittoon a crust of bread I had been eating from my own supply. The peasant, my fellow-passenger, fished it out and ravenously ate it. I threw orange peel into the spittoon. The peasant again grabbed and devoured it. The Communist subsided.”For more than half a century, the Soviet Union denied the Holodomor had occurred. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the archives of the Soviet Communist Party secret police and government confirmed that deliberate actions were to blame.According to an account in Britannica by journalist and historian Anne Applebaum, Ukrainian researchers determined that the overall death toll included 3.9 million Ukrainians, with mass graves dug in the countryside and corpses lining the streets of cities. But there was more:“The famine was accompanied by a broader assault on Ukrainian identity. While peasants were dying by the millions, agents of the Soviet secret police were targeting the Ukrainian political establishment and intelligentsia. The famine provided cover for a campaign of repression and persecution that was carried out against Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian religious leaders. The official policy of Ukrainization, which had encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language, was effectively halted.” Contemporary Russia maintains the Holodomor is not a genocide of Ukraine because it was “a severe famine broke out in the Soviet Union” in 1932-1933, that killed many nationalities.Zakharova's unsupported claim that the West demanded grain for payment is a stretch, based on the Holodomor Museum's information on grain exports during the famine:""At the time when millions of Ukrainians were dying in severe hunger agony, the Soviet government exported Ukrainian grain to other republics of the USSR. The restriction of grain exports in 1931 and its complete cessation in 1932−1933 could have prevented the famine.""Moreover, such decisions in no way influenced the process of industrialization because during this period world prices on wheat fell down. The USSR received significantly more profits from the export of timber and oil products.""In addition, quite large volumes of grain were accumulated in the state reserves, but these resources were not used to assist the hungry Ukraine. This shows the intentional actions for the organization of famine in Ukraine.""";https://www.euronews.com/2022/11/30/holodomor-germanys-parliament-recognises-ukraines-1930s-famine-as-genocide,https://www.britannica.com/event/Holodomor,https://www.britannica.com/event/Holodomor,https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/ukraine-horror-past-terror-future,https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/en/recognition-of-holodomor-as-genocide-in-the-world/,https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2022/kw48-de-holodomor-923060,https://ria.ru/20221130/golodomor-1835336519.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/26/AR2008042602039.html,http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamine6Genocideof1932hD73.htm,https://holodomor.ca/resource/entry-on-the-holodomor-in-the-internet-encyclopedia-of-ukraine/,https://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/day-after-day/holodomor-1932-33-genocide-gaps-evidential-basis,https://ewjus.com/index.php/ewjus/article/view/Andriewsky/24,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/stalin-collectivization.htm,http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamine6Genocideof1932hD73.htm,http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamine6Genocideof1932hD73.htm,http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/info.asp,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/26/AR2008042602039_2.html,https://youtu.be/Sr5WkhEiqcY?t=111,http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamine6Genocideof1932hD73.htm,https://holodomor.ca/resource/was-the-holodomor-a-genocide/,http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamine6Genocideof1932hD73.htm,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Internal-memorandum-from-the-Deputy-People%E2%80%99s-Commissar-of-Agriculture-of-the-USSR-A.-V.-Grinevich.pdf,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/From-a-summary-report-by-the-UkrSSR-GPU-On-the-Course-of-Grain-Procurement-in-Ukraine.pdf,https://www.ualberta.ca/canadian-institute-of-ukrainian-studies/news-and-events/seminars/2020/september/2020-annual-ukrainian-famine-lecture-bohdan-klid--the-last-stand-the-third-all-ukrainian-conference-of-the-communist-party-bolsheviks-of-ukraine-and-the-holodomor.html,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Letter-from-Hryhorii-Petrovsky-to-Molotov-and-Stalin.pdf,https://holodomor.ca/resource/was-the-holodomor-a-genocide/,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Resolution-of-the-Politburo-of-the-CC-CPBU-On-Measures-to-Intensify-Grain-Procurement.pdf,https://youtu.be/Sr5WkhEiqcY?t=304,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Letter-from-Vlas-Chubar-to-Molotov-and-Stalin.pdf,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Resolution-On-Safekeeping-Property-of-State-Enterprises.pdf,http://old.memorialholodomor.org.ua/eng/zakon_pro_5/,https://youtu.be/Sr5WkhEiqcY?t=476,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Political-summary-of-unpublished-letters-from-the-Reading-Office.pdf,https://youtu.be/wVkM44gym1c?t=2131,https://holodomor.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Letter-from-Hryhorii-Petrovsky-to-Molotov-and-Stalin.pdf,https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/en/news/a-tale-of-two-journalists-walter-duranty-and-gareth-jones/,https://emerging-europe.com/after-hours/mr-jones-ukraine-famine/,https://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/walking_tour.htm,https://education.holodomor.ca/teaching-materials/holodomor-denial-silences/,https://www.britannica.com/event/Holodomor,https://lenta.ru/news/2018/11/24/eto_bil_ne_genocid/,https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/en/export-of-grain/;Russia Falsely Blames the Famine That Killed Millions of Ukrainians on the West;;;;;;
17;;;;False;RT, Russian state media outlet;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/the-kremlins-false-portrayal-of-wagner-mercenaries-in-ukraine-/6863293.html;The Kremlin’s False Portrayal of Wagner Mercenaries in Ukraine;2022-12-05;polygraph;;On December 1, Margarita Simonyan, chief editor of the Russian state-owned MIA Rossiya Segodnya, published a video report praising the Wagner private military company (PMC) on her social media accounts in Twitter, Telegram and VKontakte.Simonyan wrote that an RT news crew was the first and only TV team allowed inside Wagner’s training camp “somewhere in south Russia.” She said the “unique report” they produced promised a look inside the secretive world of the “orchestra” – the nickname often used in Russia for PMC Wagner.Accompanied by dramatic music, the stylized, three-minute video is more like an extended advertisement than a news report. The video begins with RT journalist Anna Knishenko describing Wagner in heroic terms:“PMC Wagner is bravely defending the interests of the Russian world in the special military operation [in Ukraine], but the Western press calls them nothing other than ‘mercenaries’ and ‘soldiers of fortune.’”Except the portrayal is false. Not only is Wagner an aggressor in Ukraine (as are other Russian forces), and not a defender, but the company’s record of respect for human rights and the law is abysmal. Wagner is accused of war crimes in Ukraine, Syria and parts of Africa where it’s been a Kremlin tool.Wagner’s manager and financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is a long-time associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has personally recruited thousands of inmates from Russian penal colonies to fight in Ukraine. Many of those inmates had been doing life in prison for manslaughter and violent crimes.Wagner has been operating inside Ukraine since conflict began in 2014. Since Russia launched its all-out invasion in late February, Wagner has increased the number of mercenaries there and taken on a bigger role in the fighting.On December 1, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation to designate Wagner a foreign terrorist organization. The two main co-sponsors, U.S. senators Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, and Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, titled the measure the Holding Accountable Russian Mercenaries, or HARM, act.In a statement, the two senators said:“The Wagner Group is a paramilitary organization that employs thousands of mercenaries. It has been widely recognized for its work as a private military for Russian President Vladimir Putin, conducting terrorist operations in Ukraine, Mali, Sudan, and the Central African Republic that resulted in the massacre of civilians since 2014.“The Wagner Group has also murdered and threatened journalists, kidnapped children, deployed nerve agents against civilians, committed acts of torture, and engaged in rape and sex trafficking of women and children.”The United Nations, various governments, rights groups and journalists have gathered evidence of Wagner’s alleged violations of human rights, disregard for the laws of war and economic crimes around the world.On December 2, the U.S. State Department added Wagner to its list of Entities of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act, based on the group’s actions in Central African Republic. The list also includes terrorist organizations like Islamic State and al-Shabab.CNN cited a U.S. official as saying that Wagner “engaged in mass killings,” “disproportionally targeted members of religious minority groups,” and in “many instances did not discriminate between armed elements and ordinary civilians in religious minority communities.”The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Prigozhin. In 2018, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Prigozhin, who is also the principal of the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, a cyber hacking and spying outfit that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with the aim of aiding Donald Trump.The European Union also imposed sanctions against Prigozhin and PMC Wagner in 2019 for “breaching a U.N. arms embargo,” and “threatening security, damaging stability, and undermining peace process in Libya.”Canada sanctioned Prigozhin and members of his family in November for their role in Russia’s war on Ukraine. The United States and U.K. have also sanctioned Wagner and Prigozhin.All the sanctions haven’t stopped Wagner infest Africa, the U.S. State Department conceded in May:“Russia’s intensified application of disinformation and the use of the Wagner Group across Africa has spread a trail of lies and human rights abuses. Despite U.S., EU, and UK sanctions and exposure of Prigozhin-linked entities that spread disinformation, these actors continue operating in Africa, exploiting turbulent situations through disinformation to sway public support for the Russian government to expand its influence.”On December 2, a European investigative journalism collaboration said that Prigozhin has been extensively involved in the Central African Republic “blood diamond” trade with Belgium, using Wagner and a proxy firm called Diamville.Asked to respond to the evidence, Prigozhin issued a statement sarcastically claiming French President Emmanuel Macron was the actual “frontman” of the operation with the involvement of special NATO “racketeering units.”Since Wagner’s arrival in war-torn Mali in late 2021, violence and civilian deaths have spiked, analysts say. A recent report by NewsGuard, a U.S. disinformation fighting site, found that TikTok was hosting dozens of videos glorifying violence by Wagner mercenaries, including executions. The videos are used as recruiting tools and evaded TikTok’s content guidelines, NewsGuard said.;https://vk.com/wall561960677_615838,https://jamestown.org/program/unleashing-the-pmcs-and-irregulars-in-ukraine-crimea-and-donbas/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-s-chef-and-death-by-sledgehammer/6838465.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-after-years-of-falsification-putins-chef-owns-up-to-running-russian-mercenaries/6765898.html,https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/press-and-media/press-releases/helsinki-commissioners-announce-introduction,https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/12/wicker-cardin-lead-legislation-to-designate-wagner-group-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization,https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/08/africa/putins-private-army-car-intl/,https://acleddata.com/2022/08/30/wagner-group-operations-in-africa-civilian-targeting-trends-in-the-central-african-republic-and-mali/,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/02/politics/us-russia-wagner-group-religious-freedom-act/index.html,ttps://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/yevgeniy-viktorovich-prigozhin/yevgeniy-vicktorovich-prigozhin3.pdf/view,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-thirteen-russian-individuals-and-three-russian-companies-scheme-interfere,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russian-trolls-who-interfered-2016-u-s-election-also-made-n1013811,https://archive.ph/f5Q1v,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/02/canada-imposes-additional-economic-measures-on-russia-in-response-to-russias-attack-on-ukraine.html,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm787,https://alleyesonwagner.org/2022/12/02/car-prigozhins-blood-diamonds/,https://www.csis.org/analysis/massacres-executions-and-falsified-graves-wagner-groups-mounting-humanitarian-cost-mali,https://www.newsguardtech.com/misinformation-monitor/november-2022/;The Kremlin’s False Portrayal of Wagner Mercenaries in Ukraine;;;;;;

This illegal movement of arms into the region has heightened the proliferation of small arms and light weapons which continues to threaten our collective peace and security in the region.”The statement was signed and released by Buhari’s special advisor on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, on November 29.Buhari’s claim, however, is unsubstantiated. There have been no public reports of arms from the Eastern European conflict coming into the Lake Chad Basin region. Nor did Buhari provide any evidence to back up the assertion.Buhari won Nigeria’s 2015 presidential election on a counter-terrorism platform. But despite years of conflict and humanitarian losses, Boko Haram, one of the longest-operating Islamist military groups in Africa, and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA), continue to attack security forces across the region.Boko Haram has carried out multiple attacks “on religious and political groups, local police, and the military, as well as indiscriminately attacking civilians in busy markets and villages,” the Council on Foreign Relations reports.Long-running insurgencies by Boko Haram and other groups were responsible for more than 350,000 deaths through the end of 2020, a United Nations report found. Most of those deaths – 314,000 – were from indirect causes, such as lack of food or other basic needs, with the remainder involving combatants.According to the U.S. Department of State, Boko Haram and ISIS-WA have used “small arms, captured military equipment, detonated IEDs” to “carry out hundreds of attacks in Nigeria.” Cameroon, Niger, Chad and Nigeria created a Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to combat these groups and provide humanitarian aid in the Lake Chad region and elsewhere.In his remarks to the commission, Buhari did not specify who he believes is diverting the weapons and how. But one authoritative report that examined the matter, published in September of 2021, said arms have coming not from outside the region – but from the spoils of successful militant attacks.According to the International Peace Information Institute, an independent research group based in Belgium that tracks the arms trade, part of the problem is failed leadership of the multinational task force itself.“The quantity of seized small arms and light weapons is so great that it has sustained the insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin region for over a decade,” the institute said. “In fact, the study almost certainly significantly underestimates the true scale and scope of the challenge.”For one section of the report, the authors cited data on “more than 500 reported incidents of attacks on security sector personnel in the Lake Chad Basin region since January 2015 in which a Boko Haram faction is the likely perpetrator.”Those attacks resulted in nearly 2,400 dead security troops, with almost 2,000 of the total from Nigeria. The report said lack of readiness, corruption and low morale all contributed to the loss of weapons to the attackers:“A gun truck, fitted with a machine gun will frequently transport several tins of linked cartridges totaling hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A soldier may carry at least two or three magazines of 20 or 30 bullets each on his or her person. When a base is overrun, crew-served weaponry such as machine guns, mortars and towed as well as self-propelled artillery will frequently be left behind, as will thin-skinned and armoured vehicles…“More than 100 of the recorded attacks can be described as significant in terms of losses of materiel. 'Significant' is defined as an incident in which one of the following three criterion is met: (a) 10 or more weapons are seized; (b) 1,000 or more rounds of ammunition are seized; or (c) 1 or more gun trucks — or 'technicals' as these vehicles are frequently called — or armoured vehicles are seized.”In October, the United Nations office for Disarmament Affairs published a report on arms dynamics in the Lake Chad region. In regard to sources:""Main sources of illicit materiel are diversions from regional national stockpiles (mainly through raids and theft, and corruption to a lesser extent), materiel ‘recycled’ from previous conflicts in the region, as well as craft production...""Tracing of recovered materiel by specialist organizations indicates that diversions from the respective national stockpiles of [Lake Chad Basin] security and defense forces, as well as proliferation of pre-2011 Libyan stockpiles and leftovers from other conflicts in Africa are the main sources of weapons and ammunition held by Boko Haram. Materiel is acquired locally, either through battlefield capture or purchased on the illicit market.""The Nigerian president, a retired general, has been faulted for failing to make good on promises to resolve the security issues and wipe out Boko Haram. As recently as September, he described the group as “fraudulent people” and claimed they’d been defeated.But Boko Haram remains a deadly threat. Most recently, on November 22, attackers killed an estimated 30 Chadian troops “and made off with their equipment, including heavy weapons,” Al Jazeera and other outlets reported.The United States has provided Nigeria with helicopters, aircraft and other military equipment, some for use in fighting Boko Haram and other insurgencies.";https://saharareporters.com/2022/11/29/president-buhari-blames-russia-ukraine-war-insecurity-nigeria,https://projects.voanews.com/boko-haram-journey-from-evil/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=voa-special-projects&utm_source=homepage,https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/boko-haram-nigeria,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/470476-insurgency-has-killed-almost-350000-in-north-east-undp.html,https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2020/nigeria/,https://mnjtffmm.org,https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-president-ukraine-war-funneling-arms-fighters-into-lake-chad-basin/6856806.html,https://ipisresearch.be/publication/the-management-of-lethal-materiel-in-conflict-settings-existing-challenges-and-opportunities-for-the-european-peace-facility/?hilite=boko+haram+berman,file:///C:/Users/tdetz/Downloads/weapons_and_ammunition_dynamics_in_the_lake_chad_basin_final.pdf,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/04/failure-to-learn-from-our-boko-haram-experience/,https://saharareporters.com/2022/09/13/i-dont-know-why-people-fail-commend-my-government-performing-extremely-well-buhari,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/23/chadian-soldiers-killed-in-attack-by-shadowy-boko-haram,https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-nigeria/;Unsubstantiated: Buhari Claim That Ukraine War Feeds Arms to West Africa;;;;;;

In January, she was arrested on incitement charges but was released on bail in March.Human rights groups and several countries condemned her re-arrest, with the United States expressing “deep concern” on November 29.U.S. State Department Spokesman Ned Price accused Cambodian authorities of interfering “with the exercise of workers' rights by detaining union leaders and workers protesting the wrongful termination of NagaWorld employees.”“We urge Cambodian authorities to release Chhim Sithar and all detained trade unionists exercising their rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly, drop charges against them, and move to constructively resolve their disputes,” Price said in a statement.But Cambodian Justice Ministry spokesman Chin Malin said those criticizing Chhim Sithar’s arrest were feigning ignorance of Cambodia’s courtroom rules and regulations to “cover up” for the labor leader.He accused Sithar of violating her bail conditions by going abroad, adding that it is not persecution to expect compliance with the law.“All of these procedures [leading to Chhim Sithar’s arrest] are stated clearly in our laws and – in a democratic society operating under the rule of law – they must be followed.""That is misleading given Cambodia's politicized judicial system.Labor organizers have criticized Cambodian authorities for turning a union action into a criminal matter. Local human rights groups dispute that Chhim Sithar or her lawyers were made aware of any bail conditions.What’s more, under Prime Minister Hun Sen, a dictatorial strongman who has ruled Cambodia for nearly 37 years, democratic norms and the rule of law are routinely violated to persecute labor leaders and the political opposition.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen delivers a speech during the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus in Siem Reap on November 23, 2022. (Heng Sinith/AP)Analysts rank Cambodia among the world’s worst countries when it comes to the rule of law.Chhim Sithar was first arrested on January 4 and spent 74 days in pretrial detention. The charge was “incitement to commit a felony” after her union organized a strike demanding that NagaWorld reinstate and provide compensation to 365 workers the company had laid off.NagaWorld called the layoffs inevitable, citing losses from the COVID-19 pandemic’s business slowdown.Rights groups, however, said the Hong Kong-listed owner of NagaWorld, NagaCorp, had posted a profit of $102.3 million in 2020 and was pursuing expansion plans when it announced mass layoffs.NagaWorld casino workers hold hands to protect security personal during a rally in Phnom Penh on January 4, 2022. Labor union leader Chhim Sithar was arrested for the first time that day en route to take part in the strike. (Heng Sinith/AP)NagaCorp did post a $147 million loss for 2021. The main issue, however, is the right of Chhim Sithar and other NagaWorld employees to strike.Following Chhim Sithar’s initial arrest, United Nations human rights experts stressed that Cambodia’s constitution “enshrines the right to strike and the rights to freedom of association, expression, peaceful assembly, press and publication.”The U.N. experts said the arrest of trade union leaders and strikers at the Naga World casino may have violated human rights law.Cambodian civil society groups claim Chhim Sithar was never made aware that she was banned from traveling abroad.“Neither Sithar nor her lawyers were informed of any bail conditions,” a joint statement by 69 Cambodian civil society and human rights groups read.“Her lawyers’ request to view her case file, which would have contained such bail conditions, was never granted, in violation of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sithar was allowed by Cambodian immigration to leave the country earlier this month.”Prior to her re-arrest, Sithar had traveled to Thailand twice – once in September and then in October – without issue.The NagaWorld union’s vice president, Chhim Sokhom, who was likewise jailed and released on bail this year, also said she had not been made aware of travel restrictions.“On my paper, I didn’t see anything prohibited. I will let you see in case I am confused or something,” Cambodia’s independent VOD English news site quoted Sokhom as saying.Cambodia’s government-aligned Fresh News posted a document purportedly dated March 14 (and signed by a prosecutor, court clerk and judge) banning Sithar from traveling abroad.It is unclear if Sithar was shown that document, or when it was produced.Sithar’s arrest fits within a broader pattern of Cambodian authorities persecuting labor activists, the political opposition and independent media.A recent report by New York City-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented “widespread violations of workers’ rights to register, form, and join independent unions” at NagaWorld, and in other industries.HRW said restrictions under Cambodia’s “problematic” COVID-19 law were used to thwart the ability of workers to exercise their right to strike.“Authorities deemed virtually any strike to be ‘illegal,’ and police, non-uniformed police, and other security forces confronted strikers with excessive use of force, and forcibly removed them from picket lines onto city buses to transport them to the outskirts of the capital,” HRW said.The group said that in four documented cases, “authorities and employers used or threatened to resort to Cambodia’s politicized criminal justice system to silence union leaders and activist members by arbitrarily arresting, detaining, and prosecuting them, or threatening to do so if union actions did not stop.”HRW said “incitement to commit a felony” and other “bogus charges” under Cambodia’s pandemic law, “which imposes disproportionately high penalties on persons deemed to violate COVID-19 measures,” were used against the right to strike.Cambodia’s Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training spokesman dismissed the HRW report, saying it “does not reflect the truth on the ground.”But Cambodia’s dismal record on workers’ rights, and a lack of legal impartiality, are well-documented.Following a fact-finding mission in August (which included a visit with striking NagaWorld workers), Vitit Muntarbhorn, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Cambodia, made 10 recommendations.Contrary to claims that Cambodia is a democratic country, Muntarbhorn noted “the main opposition party (Cambodia National Rescue Party) was disbanded unjustly by judicial order” in 2017, effectively leaving the country “under single-party rule.”“This has led to systemic control by the powers-that-be, leading to political and other distortions undermining the call for a pluralistic democracy,” Muntarbhorn said.In November 2017, Charles Santiago, chairman of the advocacy group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, called the liquidation of the Cambodia National Rescue Party ""the final nail in the coffin for Cambodian democracy.”ASEAN is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-country regional group headquartered in Jakarta that focuses on cooperation.Muntarbhorn stressed the need to improve the judiciary, in part by distancing it “from the power base” to help ensure its “independence and impartiality.”A 2021 U.S. State Department human rights report said Cambodia’s “constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but the government did not respect judicial independence, exerting extensive control over the courts.”It continued:“Court decisions were often subject to political influence. Judicial officials, up to and including the chief of the Supreme Court, often simultaneously held positions in the ruling party, and observers alleged only those with ties to the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) or the executive received judicial appointments.

The Doctrine has been controversial, as some view it as a U.S. declaration of dominance in the Americas.“China does not meddle in anyone’s internal affairs,” Vidal stated.That is false. In fact, despite regular declarations otherwise, China has a substantial record of trying to influence politics and elections in foreign countries. The latest example involves Canada.On November 17, a video emerged of Chinese President Xi Jinping rebuking Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the G-20 summit over what Xi said were news media leaks from a prior meeting with Trudeau.“Everything we discussed has been leaked to the paper. That’s not appropriate,” Xi scolded Trudeau through a translator. “That’s not the way the conversation was conducted.”“If there is sincerity on your part, we can conduct good communications with an attitude of mutual respect,” Xi continued. “Otherwise, the results would be hard to tell.”Trudeau responded: “In Canada, we believe in a free and open and frank dialogue, and that is what we will continue to have. We will continue to look to work constructively together, but there will be things that we will disagree on…”“Let’s create the conditions first,” Xi replied, then walked away after a handshake.What were the “leaks” Xi complained about? In fact, they were Trudeau’s “serious concerns” about alleged Chinese interference in Canada’s internal affairs.According to The Wall Street Journal’s reporting, Trudeau raised the matter with Xi during an informal 10-minute discussion the pair had earlier at the summit in Bali, Indonesia. But those concerns had been highlighted by Trudeau and Canadian media long before then.On November 7, Trudeau warned that China was “continuing to play aggressive games with our institutions, with our democracies.”The remark followed an extensive expose by the Canadian network Global News saying China was suspected of “targeting Canada with a vast campaign of foreign interference, which includes funding a clandestine network of at least 11 federal candidates running in the 2019 election,” according to briefings by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).Two weeks earlier, Canadian police had announced investigations into a network of clandestine and illegal Chinese “police stations” in Toronto.The “police stations” were allegedly used to facilitate coerced repatriations of Chinese citizens targeted by Beijing’s Operation Fox Hunt, an anti-corruption program to bring purported overseas fugitives to China.(Polygraph.info has previously fact checked Operation Fox Hunt and the global network of Chinese overseas police stations.)The CSIS had been briefing Trudeau and some of his cabinet members about the Chinese activities since January, with “detailed examples” of Beijing’s alleged efforts to “further its influence and, in turn, subvert Canada’s democratic process,” the Global News report said, reporting:“[T]hose efforts allegedly involve payments through intermediaries to candidates affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), placing agents into the offices of MPs in order to influence policy, seeking to co-opt and corrupt former Canadian officials to gain leverage in Ottawa, and mounting aggressive campaigns to punish Canadian politicians whom the People’s Republic of China (PRC) views as threats to its interests.”One of the most stunning allegations was that Chinese consulate officials in Toronto had directed a large clandestine transfer of cash to at least 11 federal election candidates, from both the Liberal and Conservative parties, and to a network of Beijing operatives who worked as their campaign staffers, said the Global News report, citing intelligence sources familiar with the briefings.CSIS alleged that the funds were transferred through a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) of Ontario and a federal election candidate's staffer, Global News said.“Separate sources aware of the situation said a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) proxy group, acting as an intermediary, transferred around $250,000,” the news report wrote, adding that “some, but not all, members of the alleged network are witting affiliates” of the CCP.“China conducts more foreign interference than any other nation, and interference threats to Canada increased in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping elevated the CCP’s so-called United Front influence networks abroad,” Global News wrote, citing information from the 2022 intelligence briefings.China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a CCP lobbying entity accused of illicit intelligence and propaganda operations around the globe, has been a common actor in political interference allegations from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and others.(Polygraph.info has previously reported on China’s record of meddling in Australian politics and elections.)The UFWD, which “operates through Chinese consulates in Canada,” is responsible for “orchestrat[ing]” political interference in Canada, the 2022 intelligence briefings claimed, according to Global News.“United Front operations can include politicians, media, business, student and community groups, and are aimed at consolidating support for CCP policy as well as targeting critics and the causes of ethnic groups seen as ‘poisons’ by the CCP, such as Uyghurs and Tibetans,” Global News reported.In April 2021, a Conservative MP from British Columbia, Kenny Chiu, proposed a Foreign Influence Registration Act to counter interference activities that the CSIS had been sounding the alarm about.Chiu was subsequently attacked by a disinformation campaign allegedly orchestrated by China’s interference network in the 2021 federal election.Chiu’s proposed law “was condemned on Chinese-language social media, alleging his plan would ‘suppress the Chinese community’ in Canada. The comments were disseminated on apps and websites widely used by some Canadians of Chinese origin, who make up approximately half of his riding’s or constituency’s population,” Canada’s The Globe and Mail reported in January.The efforts targeting Chiu were documented and analyzed by the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council think tank in November 2021.The CSIS also alleged that the Toronto Chinese Consulate transferred $1 million Canadian to “unidentified proxy groups” that organized protests to support Toronto District School Board’s partnership with China’s Confucius Institute in 2014. Many parents, teachers and students had reportedly opposed the integration, which eventually failed.The UFWD in Canada also allegedly engaged in harassing critics of Beijing.Citing the CSIS briefings, Global News reported that Chinese intelligence agents allegedly “conducted in-depth background research” into the House of Commons MPs who had voted for a February 2021 resolution that declared China’s mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang province a genocide.The Global News also cited the CSIS briefings to report Chinese interference efforts to “infiltrate, surveil and ‘mess with’ Chinese diaspora communities.”Here is one example that targeted the Uyghur community, as reported by the Global News:""Turnisa Matsedik-Qira, a Uyghur-Canadian activist, said many in her community believe Chinese agents monitored and harassed them. She provided photos from her December 2021 Facebook posting that showed one alleged incident. In the post, Matsedik-Qira says she was protesting outside the Chinese Consulate in Vancouver when a van pulled up, and two men jumped out.“ 'I'm scared and worried for my safety. I think he is connected to the Chinese Consulate, for sure. The Consulate has many people in Canada working for China.' ” On November 15, the day Trudeau had the 10-minute discussion with Xi, Canadian authorities arrested Yuesheng Wang, a researcher at Canada’s largest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, on espionage charges.Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement that Wang allegedly ""obtained trade secrets to benefit the People's Republic of China, to the detriment of Canada's economic interests.""China has also been accused of political interference in elections in democracies including the United States, the U.K. and New Zealand.On July 4, 2017, Egypt authorities rounded up over 100 Uyghur Muslims from China, most of them university students who held valid residency permits, allegedly at Beijing’s request, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported in September 2017, citing sources including a Uyghur student who was later released.“We were first interrogated by the Egyptian police, but not tortured or mistreated,” the student told RFA. “After the interrogations, they told us that they had detained us because of a Chinese government request [amid concerns] that we were ‘terrorists.’ ”According to the student, the police told the detained students that “this is politics between two countries.” They told the students that no evidence of terrorism was found in the interrogations and that they would be released.(RFA is a sister U.S.-funded news agency to Voice of America and Polygraph.info.)";https://mobile.twitter.com/CGTNOfficial/status/1592125192871911424,https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/december-2-1823-seventh-annual-message-monroe-doctrine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/us-russia-putin-ukraine.html,https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/friends-and-enemies-a-framework-for-understanding-chinese-political-interference-in-democratic-countries/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-meddling-in-australian-politics/6743278.html,https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-growing-interference-domestic-politics-globally-and-united-states,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mps-probe-chinese-interference-elections-1.6651121,https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/chinas-xi-jinping-chides-justin-trudeau-at-g-20-video-shows-11668620157,https://globalnews.ca/news/9253386/canadian-intelligence-warned-pm-trudeau-that-china-covertly-funded-2019-election-candidates-sources/,https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/involuntary-returns-report-exposes-long-arm-policing-overseas,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-fox-hunt-operation/6743252.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-beijing-covers-up-after-china-s-overseas-police-spy-stations-are-exposed/6818553.html,https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/China%27s%20Overseas%20United%20Front%20Work%20-%20Background%20and%20Implications%20for%20US_final_0.pdf,https://globalnews.ca/news/9253386/canadian-intelligence-warned-pm-trudeau-that-china-covertly-funded-2019-election-candidates-sources/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-disinformation-campaign-against-hong-kong-canadian-mp-a-disturbing/,https://medium.com/dfrlab/china-linked-wechat-accounts-spread-disinformation-in-advance-of-2021-canadian-election-cb5a8389049,https://globalnews.ca/news/9253386/canadian-intelligence-warned-pm-trudeau-that-china-covertly-funded-2019-election-candidates-sources/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/15/canada-espionage-china-hydro-quebec/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/04/china-us-midterm-election-interference-meddling-social-media-cybersecurity-disinformation/,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/uk/uk-parliament-china-intl-gbr,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/magic-weapons-chinas-political-influence-activities-under-xi-jinping,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/egyptian-authorities-forcibly-disappear-16-uyghur-students-from-notorious-prison-09252017124938.html;How Canada Contradicts Chinese Denials of Meddling Abroad;;;;;;

Could a Russian strike on Poland, a NATO member, bring the U.S. and allies into the war?Polish President Andrzej Duda visits the site of an explosion in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland near the border with Ukraine, on November 17, 2022. (Jakub Szymczuk/KPRP/Poland's President Office Handout/via Reuters)At issue was Article 5 in the charter of the 30-member NATO alliance. That provision says an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.With that chilling prospect looming, Li Jingjing, a journalist at China’s state-run CGTN, posted a video on YouTube Shorts describing the G-20 in skit form.Li portrayed the mood of different countries using theatrical facial expressions and captions. But at one point, she insinuated that the U.S. hadn’t been forthcoming about the missile strike on Poland.Role-playing as both President Joe Biden and questioner, she said:Journalist: “Mr. President [Biden]. Can you tell us anything about the recent missile strike in Poland?”Biden: “No!”Screen capture from CGTN reporter Li Jingjing's YouTube Short, ""The 2022 G20 in Bali in a nutshell,"" uploaded on November 18, 2022. (Lijingjing/YouTube Shorts)Trouble is, the idea that Biden stonewalled the press is false.Initial reports from Ukraine said the missile strike appeared to be from Russia. That day, November 15, Russian forces had sent scores of missiles at targets across Ukraine.Following news of the Polish explosion, Biden convened an emergency meeting with Group of Seven and NATO leaders in Bali. And he later had the following exchange with a reporter:Question: “Mr. President, is it too early to say whether this missile was fired from Russia?”Biden: “There is preliminary information that contests that. I don’t want to say that until we completely investigate. But it is – I – it’s unlikely, in the minds of the trajectory, that it was fired from Russia. But we’ll see. We’ll see.”Question: “Mr. President, has Poland suggested invoking Article 4 or 5 from NATO, sir?”Biden: “The consensus is we’re going to probably have a meeting of the – of the – of the ambassadors. So that’s – it looks like we’re going to go do next.”On November 16, U.S. officials told the Associated Press their initial findings suggested the missile that struck Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces defending themselves from an incoming Russian missile.NATO shared that assessment but was quick to state it was not Ukraine’s fault.“Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, reaffirming Ukraine’s right to self-defense.Polish authorities and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also assessed the missile was of Ukrainian origin.But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy disputed that it was fired by Ukraine.“I have no doubt, it was not our missile, and not our missile strike,” Zelensky said.When a reporter asked Biden about Zelenskyy’s comments, Biden replied: “That’s not the evidence.”NBC news described the “public split” over the incident as potentially the “most significant rift so far between Ukraine and its supporters.”For its part, Russia denied targeting Poland, but it has continued to rain missiles down at civilian infrastructure targets throughout Ukraine in a strategy that Western politicians say amounts to a war crime.";https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/60201/2022-11-16-g20-declaration-data.pdf,https://apnews.com/article/british-politics-biden-g-20-summit-china-indonesia-fda2b5ad249d72cc49071f7a8b4503fc,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-a-polish-provocation-blatant-russian-disinfo-distracts-from-apparent-war-crimes/6837048.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-missiles.html,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/15/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-explosion-and-loss-of-life-in-eastern-poland/,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-officials-initial-findings-suggest-missile-hit-poland-93382667,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_209104.htm,https://meduza.io/en/news/2022/11/16/zelensky-on-the-missile-strike-in-poland-i-have-no-doubt-they-were-not-our-missiles,https://www.yahoo.com/now/biden-thats-not-evidence-061120610.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANnrWWcrMtdDpOoRCSSy35Mlwom12Wtcdcov9SsYhfDZrUxGoFbLqv_BsO_a_iHVdA24HFMCUp0wHoyIvzTr2m1UwN9uwFwNQjsnI6sLRMSjtB2xpop0911DncgB152Pj0vSGqUg4bRulrpsQNBkMWA35q5k_v2Yly6VoYykHgj_,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-allies-clash-poland-blast-biden-evidence-putin-war-rcna57631”,https://tass.com/defense/1537211;Chinese Disinfo Falsifies Biden’s Statement on Poland Missile Strike;;;;;;

As a result, the involvement of the Russian Federation in the conflict with Ukraine led the conflict to become an international one,” the court said in a summary of the verdict posted online.But Russia has steadfastly denied blame for the plane’s demise. Now, in reporting the verdict, Russia’s Sputnik news agency falsified the court’s extension of responsibility to the Kremlin.Sputnik reported: “The Hague District Court ruled that the crash of the MH17 plane was connected to a non-international armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.”In fact, the court said just the opposite.Polygraph.info has fact-checked Russian disinformation about MH17 numerous times over the years. The court’s ruling marks a milestone that leaves no room for doubt that a Russian Buk anti-aircraft system was transported across the Russian border into Ukraine and deliberately used to fire on flight MH17 as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.All four defendants remain at large and were tried in absentia. The court handed life sentences to Russians Igor Girkin and Sergey Dubinskiy, and to Ukrainian separatist Leonid Kharchenko. Another Russian, Oleg Pulatov, was acquitted for not having firsthand involvement. The court also awarded the families of those killed $16.5 million in damages.The court found that Dubinskiy, commanding officer for the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DPR) militants, was in charge of getting the Russian Buk system to the launch site from across the Ukraine border. Kharchenko, as executive commander, ensured that it was guarded thus a “co-perpetrator.”Girkin, the court said, was highest DPR military leader in eastern Ukraine and bore ultimate responsibility. “He also actively endeavored to make the [launcher] used on 17 July 2014 disappear as quickly as possible, rather than condemning its use,” the court said.Girkin is a former colonel in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), while Dubinskiy is a former officer in the Russian military intelligence service or GRU. The court acquitted Pulatov, another ex-GRU officer aware of the Buk’s arrival but not present at the launch.Sputnik’s report on the verdict also recycled old Russian claims that the Dutch investigation had refused to accept “evidence” from Moscow “proving” a Ukrainian missile was used.However, the court cited a sweeping volume of evidence:“In the view of the Court, it has been proven that Flight MH17 was hit by a [Russian] Buk missile fired from a farm field near Pervomaiskyi in Ukraine. This field was located in separatist-controlled territory. “The Court has no doubt whatsoever that the MH17 was hit by a Buk missile fired from this farm field. This is clear from photographs of a smoke trail in the sky, statements by a protected witness, satellite images, intercepted telephone conversations and transmission mast data, photographs and videos of a Buk TELAR being brought in and removed, and examination of fragments in the remains of a crew member and in the truss and the groove of the aircraft. “Investigation in the Netherlands and abroad has not revealed any traces of evidence tampering. Alternative scenarios, for example, that the Buk missile was fired from a different area, are ruled out based on the evidence.”Explaining the rationale for life sentences, the court said:“Causing the crash of Flight MH17 and the murders of all persons on board is such a serious accusation, the consequences are so devastating, and the attitude of the accused is so reprehensible, that a limited period of imprisonment will not suffice.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement welcoming the verdict as the result of international collaboration.“Today’s decision is the result of sustained work by a Joint Investigation Team comprised of authorities from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine,” he said, “and reflects the Netherlands’ firm commitment to establish the truth and pursue accountability in this case.”;https://www.courtmh17.com/en/news/2022/summary-of-the-day-in-court-17-november-2022---judgment.html,https://www.courtmh17.com/en/news/2022/summary-of-the-day-in-court-17-november-2022---judgment.html ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-mh17-trial/6743134.html ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlins-debunked-mh17-theories/6741839.html ,https://sputniknews.com/20221117/dutch-court-issues-guilty-verdict-to-three-accused-acquits-one-in-mh17-trial-1104054804.html,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=MH-17&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10 ,https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-russian-crimes-of-2014?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=auto_share,https://www.polygraph.info/a/as-russia-walks-away-from-mh17-crash-talks-more-recycled-spin/6742626.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlins-debunked-mh17-theories/6741839.html ;Russia’s Sputnik Falsifies Court Ruling in Malaysian MH17 Shootdown;;;;;;

This, after U.S. President Joe Biden just held calming talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.U.S. President Joe Biden, right, and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands before a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit meeting on November 14, 2022, in Bali, Indonesia. (Alex Brandon/AP)“The U.S. is preparing for a provocation comparable to [U.S. House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi's visit to Taiwan,” state-run Sputnik reported.“China may beef up its defenses in the Spratly Islands following the U.S. vice president's visit to Palawan. Progress in resolving the South China Sea issue deprives the United States of the tools to exert pressure on China.”But it’s false to equate Pelosi’s August visit to Taiwan with Harris’ planned visit to Palawan. The two are apples and oranges.Beijing claims the island of democratic Taiwan as its territory. Though China also claims control of the Spratly Islands, Palawan is incontestably recognized as a part of the Philippines, by treaty a U.S. ally and important security partner.What’s more, China’s militarization of the South China Sea [and Spratly Islands] has prompted the Philippines to ramp up military cooperation with the U.S.Let’s step back a bit.In 2009, China claimed it has “indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof.”This includes the Spratly Islands, which also are claimed in part or in whole by six other countries. (The U.S. has not weighed in on those sovereignty claims but maintains freedom of navigation operations in the region).The USS Ralph Johnson (DDG 114) operates in waters near the Spratly Islands on July 14, 2020. (Anthony Collier/U.S. Navy)The Philippines challenged China’s claims at the international Permanent Court of Arbitration, and in 2016, the court largely found in the Philippines’ favor.The court did not rule on issues of territorial sovereignty or maritime boundaries in the South China Sea, but it did reaffirm the right of states to operate within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). These zones are recognized in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea as the 200-nautical mile stretch of sea from the coast of a state.China has ignored the court. China continues to assert claims inside the Philippines’ EEZ and periodically denies the Philippines the right to operate there.Take Mischief Reef, an atoll in the eastern part of the Spratly Islands located 201 kilometers from Palawan Island and 962 kilometers from China’s Hainan Island.An airstrip made by China is seen beside structures and buildings at the man-made island on Mischief Reef on March 20, 2022. (Aaron Favila/AP)Mischief Reef falls within the Philippines’ EEZ, yet China took control of it in 1994.The Sputnik report claimed China may beef up its defenses in the Spratly Islands in response to Harris’ visit. But China has been doing that already, having fully militarized Mischief Reef and other features in the Spratly Islands.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has built facilities on six of the 15 Spratly Islands features it occupies, including Subi Reef, which is 26 kilometers from Thitu Island in Palawan province.Beijing has installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on three of its fortified Spratly Island outposts.China also seized the Scarborough Shoal, 220 kilometers east of the Philippines island of Luzon. China’s military blockade of the shoal violates the international court’s 2016 ruling.In March 2021, the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs intensified demands that China withdraw dozens of “maritime militia” ships “moored, anchored and stationary at Julian Felipe Reef,” in the Spratly Islands and the Philippines’ EEZ, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported.(RFA is a sister U.S. government-funded news organization to the Voice of America and Polygraph.info.)In April 2021, two missile-equipped Chinese navy vessels chased a Philippine civilian vessel with a news crew on board 144 kilometers from mainland Palawan.In November 2021, China’s coast guard blocked and used water cannons against Philippine resupply ships headed to the Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, a submerged reef in the Spratly Islands that is within the Philippines’ EEZ.The Philippines has lodged more than 300 diplomatic protests against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea. Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said war could erupt with China if the Philippines asserts its rights in its EEZ.Thus, Sputnik’s claims that the U.S. is meddling in the South China Sea disputes so it can continue “exerting pressure on China” does not reflect the reality of what’s actually been happening in the South China Sea.In fact, China has been systematically exerting pressure on its neighbors.The Philippines and U.S. signed a mutual defense treaty in 1951 and an enhanced defense agreement in 2014 allowing for a bigger U.S. military presence.On November 15, Manila announced that the United States would spend $66.5 million toward construction of training and warehouse facilities at three of its military bases, Reuters reported.Rather than provoking China, South China Sea expert Gregory Poling told Reuters that Harris’ visit would signal U.S. support to the Philippines “without angering Beijing,” as the visit is not to a disputed territory.""It will be reassuring to the Philippines by sending a clear signal that, even with Ukraine and Taiwan center stage, the United States still recognizes the South China Sea as central to the future of the U.S.-Philippine alliance,"" said Poling.The situation regarding Taiwan is a different matter.A military statue and Taiwanese flag on top of an arch built in remembrance of the Battle of Guningtou in 1949 at Taiwan's Kinmen islands, which lie 3.2 kilometers from mainland China's coast.

(Sam Yeh/AFP)During talks with Biden in Bali, Xi stressed Beijing’s view that Taiwan is an integral part of China.""The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations,” Xi said, according to news reports.On August 2, Pelosi visited Taiwan to “honor America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy” and reaffirm U.S. support for their shared interests, “including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”China responded by ramping up military drills around Taiwan, bringing tensions to their highest level in decades.The U.S. is considering an “unprecedented” military aid package for the island nation, with U.S. lawmakers arguing they should do for Taiwan what they should have done for Ukraine — arm the island before China invades.Taiwan’s democratically elected government rejects Chinese Communist Party rule, and operates as an independent country, although it has never officially declared independence.In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the People’s Republic of China as China’s “only legitimate representatives” at the U.N., and expelled representatives of the Republic of China [Taiwan] from the body.The U.S. maintains a ""One China"" policy, under which Washington recognizes the Chinese Communist Party as “the sole legal government of China” but leaves the status of Taiwan undetermined while only “acknowledg[ing]” Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China.”";https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-kamala-harris-visit-philippine-island-edge-south-china-sea-dispute-2022-11-15/,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-china-us-relations,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reacts-fiercely-to-pelosi-s-taiwan-visit-/6686365.html,https://amti.csis.org/mischief-reef/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/southchinasea/china-artificial-islands-10312022043801.html,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/china-added-missile-systems-on-spratly-islands-in-south-china-sea.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/demand-03312021154924.html,https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/9/Chinese-vessels-chase-Filipino-crew-West-Philippine-Sea.html,https://amti.csis.org/the-second-thomas-shoal-incident-and-the-reset-in-philippine-u-s-ties/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-protests-chinas-illegal-acts-disputed-south-china-sea-atoll-2022-06-11/,https://news.usni.org/2014/04/29/new-defense-agreement-philippines-u-s-basics,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-kamala-harris-visit-philippine-island-edge-south-china-sea-dispute-2022-11-15/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-tells-biden-taiwan-issue-is-first-red-line-that-must-not-be-crossed-2022-11-14/,https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-asia-beijing-nancy-pelosi-8fa31bee2bc1dc9979ecd21f7185f7ec,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/11/13/taiwan-china-invasion-military-aid/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-so-taiwan-has-been-chinese-for-two-millennia-lets-check-the-history/6743451.html,https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter;US Veep’s Philippines Visit Is Not a Taiwan-Style ‘Provocation’;;;;;;

Reuters said it wasn’t immediately able to confirm the video, which was titled, “The hammer of revenge.” It showed Nuzhin being violently bludgeoned to the ground with a sledgehammer. On November 14, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the founder of Wagner, filed for a criminal investigation of the video with the Russian General Prosecutor’s office. Prigozhin’s press service published a copy of his complaint on Telegram.In the complaint, Prigozhin confirmed that the man in the video was Nuzhin and that he had been a Wagner mercenary. But without providing any evidence, Prigozhin asserted that Nuzhin’s death came at the hands of American agents.He said:“It is absolutely clear to me that Nuzhin was kidnapped and brutally killed by the employees of the U.S. intelligence services.” ""Wagner employees are distinguished by their exemplary discipline and strict adherence to international standards and globally accepted rules of social behavior."" In fact, rights groups have documented alleged human rights abuses by Wagner mercenaries in Africa and elsewhere, including summary executions. Prigozhin’s accusation that the U.S. killed Nuzhin, on the other hand, is unsubstantiated.Wagner has been called “Putin’s secret army” because of Prigozhin’s long ties to the Russian president and the company’s history of working with Russian-aligned forces in Syria, Libya, other African countries, and Ukraine. Prigozhin is popularly known as ""Putin's chef"" because of the Kremlin catering contracts his businesses have obtained over the years.After long denying a connection to Wagner, Prigozhin recently said he founded the company in 2014 as ""a group of patriots to fight for the independence"" of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Since then, Wagner has become notorious for a long record of alleged atrocities.In 2019, for instance, a Wagner-associated account on the Russian social platform vKontakte shared a gruesome video of a Syrian man being tortured, killed with a sledgehammer, beheaded, dismembered, and set on fire by six Russian-speaking individuals wearing military attire.A joint investigation by the independent Russian news organization Novaya Gazeta, the International Federation for Human Rights, the Russian Memorial Human Rights Center (recently banned in Russia), and the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression identified the victim as a Syrian refugee and his executioners as mercenaries with Wagner.In March 2021, the three nongovernmental organizations filed a criminal complaint against Wagner with the Russian Investigative Committee on behalf of the victim’s brother. (On January 21, the court in Moscow rejected the complaint.)Prigozhin’s first reaction to the Grey Zone bludgeoning video was not to file a complaint or issue a denial. To the contrary, his company’s press service quoted Prigozhin as commenting that Nuzhin had “met with unkind but just people.”He added:“I think this movie is called 'To a Dog, a Dog’s Death.' It's a great directorial work, a breathtaking film. I hope that not a single animal was injured during the production of the film.”The next day, Prigozhin followed with a longer comment via his press service, stating that “betrayal of your people is the highest degree of treachery,” and deserves the most severe punishment.“Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed consciously,” Prigozhin said on Telegram via his press office.Something changed two days later. Then, Prigozhin flatly denied any connection to events in the video, which had prompted questions from the press at the Kremlin and the prosecutor’s office.On November 14, the Kremlin press spsokesperson Dmitry Peskov also denied any knowledge of the video and questioned its authenticity. “We don't know what that is or how true it is. It's none of our business,” Peskov said.The Russian human rights watchdog Gulagu.net said on November 13 that it asked for a war crimes investigation of Wagner on behalf of Nuzhin’s family.Nuzhin’s statement about defecting to Ukraine corresponds with multiple interviews he gave to Ukrainian news media, including a September 15 session with prominent Ukrainian journalist Yury Butusov. In that interview, Nuzhin said Prigozhin had recruited him from a penal colony, where he had been serving 28 years for manslaughter.On November 15, Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said that Nuzhin signed a voluntary prisoner swap consent agreement before being returned to Russia. Nuzhin was part of a ""package"" exchange of 45 Russian POWs, Podolyak told the independent Russian news channel Rain.This undated photograph handed out by French military on Jan. 6, 2022, shows three Russian mercenaries, right, in northern Mali. (French Army via AP)The United Nations and international rights groups have reported a recurring disregard for international norms by Wagner in Syria, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, Libya, and Ukraine.Experts at the U.N. Human Rights Office said in an October 27, 2021, report on the CAR that Wagner Group mercenaries:“… are committing systemic and grave human rights and international humanitarian law violations, including arbitrary detention, torture, disappearances, and summary execution, a pattern that continues unabated and unpunished.” “Wagner Group officers have committed rape and sexual violence against women, men, and young girls in many parts of the country. It is not clear how many people have been victims of sexual violence because survivors are terrified to bring their cases to justice for fear of retaliation.” In Libya, Wagner mercenaries have been employed by the oppositional Libyan National Army since 2019 in a “breach of the existing arms embargo” by the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. rights office said, and Wagner mercenaries are also accused of summarily executing three civilians in Libya in 2019.";https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sledgehammer-execution-russian-mercenary-who-defected-ukraine-shown-video-2022-11-13/ ,https://t.me/concordgroup_official/32,https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/07/08/putin-s-not-so-secret-mercenaries-patronage-geopolitics-and-wagner-group-pub-79442 ,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/volodymyr-zelensky-russian-mercenaries-ordered-to-kill-ukraine-president-cvcksh79d,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-after-years-of-falsification-putins-chef-owns-up-to-running-russian-mercenaries/6765898.html ,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/man-in-syrian-torture-video-identified-as-wagner-group-mercenary-fqss9q2qm ,https://www.newarab.com/news/russian-mercenaries-behead-syrian-refugee-gruesome-leaked-video ,https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/syria-q_a-en_11_march_1_.docx.pdf ,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/15/europe/rights-groups-lawsuit-russian-wagner-mercenaries-intl/index.html ,https://the film.” https://theins.ru/en/news/256970 ,https://t.me/concordgroup_official/27 ,https://theins.ru/en/news/256970,https://theins.ru/en/news/256970,https://gulagu.net/news/2022-11-13-1504.html ,https://youtu.be/t4dJRPHuzFg ,https://news.yahoo.com/fighter-wagner-group-killed-camera-084510553.html,https://t.me/tvrain/59900,https://acleddata.com/2022/08/30/wagner-group-operations-in-africa-civilian-targeting-trends-in-the-central-african-republic-and-mali/ ,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2021/11/car-russian-wagner-group-harassing-and-intimidating-civilians-un-experts ,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2020/06/libya-violations-related-mercenary-activities-must-be-investigated-un-experts ;Putin’s Chef and Death by Sledgehammer;;;;;;

He Said Just the Opposite.;2022-11-04;polygraph;;"A Twitter user called “UkraineNews” with nearly 40,000 followers is spreading a manipulated video that falsely portrays Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as threatening war.The blurry video is not dated. Zelenskyy is younger and wears civilian clothes instead of the military attire he adopted after Russia attacked Ukraine in February.The video appears under the heading: “We will wage war on #Donbass! – Zelenskyy.” In the video, Zelenskyy says:“From this day on, we have martial law. We are going to war. Our army is ready. We will wage war on Donbas. We will take our territories back by war. We are not indifferent to how many people will die, but we are ready to take back our land. We are ready for direct military action on the occupied territories.” Trouble is, the video has been selectively edited to remove the full context for those words; in complete form, Zelenskyy actually rejects war.It turns out that the 30-second cut is taken from Zelenskyy’s remarks during several hours of questioning by journalists at the Kyiv Food Market on October 10, 2019.The entire session has been posted to YouTube by various media and state channels, including by Ukraine’s Channel 24 TV and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Ukrainian Service. (RFE/RL is a sister U.S.-funded news agency to the Voice of America and Polygraph.info.)In the complete video, the Ukrainian president is asked about the necessity of a tougher response to Russian military activities in Donbas, where the Kremlin incited an armed conflict in 2014. (Donbas is in eastern Ukraine, along the Russian border.)Zelenskyy answered:“I am the president of peace. Ending this war is of utmost importance to me. People did not vote for a president who’d come in and say that from this day on we have martial law. We are going to war. Our army is ready. We will wage war on Donbas. We will take our territories back by war. We are not indifferent to how many people will die, but we are ready to take back our land. We are ready for direct military action in the occupied territories.” But importantly, Zelensky continued the passage by saying:“The reality is that our army is not ready. I, the president, am not ready to sacrifice our people. And that is why I choose diplomacy.” The misleading excerpt has been shared online with captions justifying Russia’s February invasion and September’s fake referendums orchestrated by the Kremlin in occupied regions.As of November 4, the UkraineNews video tweet had almost 200,000 views and more than 3,500 retweets and likes. Who is behind the Twitter account is unclear, but it uses the Soviet Union's coat of arms in its profile and a photograph of Russia’s nuclear missile “Sarmat” being paraded across Moscow’s Red Square.Most of the UkraineNews followers on Twitter appear to be anonymous, with many using Russian and brandishing the invasion’s signature symbol “Z”.

Dutch authorities said an investigation is under way to determine the exact nature of the stations’ activities.Days earlier, Ireland also ordered China to shut down a “police service station” operating in Dublin. And investigations into China’s overseas policing activities are happening elsewhere as well, thanks to an expose by the Spanish human rights organization Safeguard Defenders alleging the operations are illegal.On November 2, a journalist from Agence France-Presse asked Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian about the matter, noting the Dutch government said Beijing had never asked permission to open police service stations in the Netherlands.Zhao denied that China was operating such stations on foreign soil:“[T]he sites you mentioned are not ‘police stations’ or ‘police service centers.’ They assist overseas Chinese nationals who need help in accessing the online service platform to get their driving licenses renewed and receive physical check-ups for that purpose.”That is misleading.Zhao asserts that the centers are solely intended to “assist overseas Chinese nationals” with documents and other administrative actions. But evidence from Safeguard Defenders argues they are part of China’s broader effort to bring home dissidents and accused criminals under China’s “persuasion to return policy.”The Chinese Embassy in Rome, Italy on October 27, 2022. China has reportedly established dozens of “overseas police stations” in around the world that could be used to track and harass dissidents. (Gregorio Borgia/AP)Existence of the stations — sometimes called 110 Overseas, after China’s emergency phone number — was revealed in September. Safeguard Defenders said China runs at least 54 such stations in “dozens of countries across five continents.”Although Chinese overseas assistance centers have existed without an extraterritorial policing role, Safeguard Defenders said that starting in 2018 they took on the “more sinister goal” of cracking down on alleged criminal activity and dissident behavior “involving overseas Chinese.”Safeguard Defenders said the impetus was China’s desire to track down individuals accused of financial and telecommunications fraud, specifically in “nine forbidden countries,” including Myanmar and Cambodia, where Chinese nationals were believed to be engaged in such activities.However, the group said most of police service stations are in Western democratic nations, particularly in Europe, not the “nine forbidden countries.”And Safeguard Defenders said Chinese authorities provided “direct evidence” of the centers' involvement in coercing Chinese nationals to return home.The group described the case of a suspect identified as Liu residing in Spain. Liu was wanted in connection with environmental pollution in China. In that case, Chinese authorities operating in Spain and China worked together to see that Liu would eventually surrender in Qingtian, a county in southeastern Zhejiang province.“Following the success of the operation, Ji Yongjun, a full-time member of the Procuratorate Committee of Qingtian County and chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC), was quoted to have said that ‘the procuratorate will launch a quick mechanism for handling cases involving overseas Chinese,’ ” Safeguard Defenders said.Spanish newspaper El Correo reported that video evidence confirms the Chinese prosecutor's office worked with ACFROC and the Qingtian Overseas Chinese Association in Spain to intimidate Liu, with a relative present, through one of the three Madrid police service centers.El Correo said it had verified that two Madrid-based businesses mentioned by Safeguard Defenders cooperated with Chinese police.Speaking with El Correo, an official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, who spoke on condition of anonymity, defended the operation.""Bilateral treaties are very cumbersome, and Europe is reluctant to extradite [to] China. I don't see what's wrong with pressuring criminals to face justice with all the guarantees contained in Chinese law,"" El Correo reported the source as saying, including the claim that “only legal means are used.”But Safeguard Defenders said the activity “violate[s] the international rule of law and may violate the territorial integrity of third countries.” Safeguard’s report said:“In eschewing regular cooperation mechanisms, the [Chinese Communist Party government] manages to avoid the growing scrutiny of its human rights record and the ensuing difficulties faced in obtaining the return of ‘fugitives’ through legal proceedings such as formal extradition requests. It leaves legal Chinese residents abroad fully exposed to extra-legal targeting by the Chinese police, with little to none of the protection theoretically ensured under both national and international law.”Separately, the Dutch-language outlets Follow the Money and RTL Nieuws, said at least two police stations had been opened in the Netherlands since 2018.The two identified stations, in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, were used to pressure dissidents to return home. Wang Jingyu, a Chinese dissident, told the Dutch news platforms that the Rotterdam station had urged him “to go back to China” and to “think about” his parents.As with other Chinese repatriation efforts, Safeguard Defenders said, “collateral punishment” against the family members of dissident and alleged criminal suspects is a key part of the “persuasion to return” operation.Safeguard Defenders outlined one such case in Mozambique:“On April 11, 2022, an ‘110 Overseas’ notice was received from Mozambique by the Yangxia Police Station, with a businessman reporting that one of his employees had stolen a large amount of cash from the company before fleeing back to China in 2020.“Upon receiving the notice, the police station immediately took to investigate and arrested the suspect on 18 May. When the suspect confessed to the existence of an accomplice, ‘Yu,’ the police quickly identified Yu and immediately mobilized to persuade him (to return) after confirming that he was still in Mozambique. After being persuaded to return, [Yu] decided to cooperate with the police and fly back to China from Mozambique.”“According to another official source on this case, the local police ‘contacted Yu’s relatives back in China and urged them to persuade Yu to surrender as soon as possible’ and, meanwhile, ‘directly got in touch with Yu and told him relevant laws and policies’, making Yu give in.”The Safeguard Defenders’ report noted that on May 23, 2019, China's People's Public Security News published an article that “expressly references the overseas centers’ role in the 'collection of overseas Chinese sentiments, public opinions and policy information push,’ as well as its global policing efforts under Operation Fox Hunt.”Polygraph.info previously reported on Operation Fox Hunt, a controversial anti-corruption program to force purported overseas “fugitives” to China.Fox Hunt entails dispatching global teams of Chinese fugitive hunters to persuade individuals to return to China, or forcibly take them, Safeguard Defenders said. The operations are at times carried out without notifying or coordinating with the government of the country where the target lives.Fox Hunt has been absorbed into a larger program called Sky Net, which expands the range of measures to target corrupt officials and others abroad. Safeguard Defenders said the goal is to crack down on money laundering, fake passports and seizing the illegal income of those who have left China.The problem, Safeguard Defenders said, is that:“Abandoning any pretext of due process or the consideration of suspects’ innocence until proven guilty, targeting suspects’ children and relatives in China as “guilty by association” or “collateral damage,” and using threats and intimidation to target suspects abroad, is now itself becoming an endemic problem.”Safeguard Defenders cited a range of sources for its report, including government documents and announcements along with Chinese state media coverage of the policing efforts.";https://www.voanews.com/a/netherlands-tells-china-to-close-police-stations-/6815747.html,https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2022/10/27/chinese-overseas-police-station-in-dublin-ordered-to-shut/,https://safeguarddefenders.com/sites/default/files/pdf/110%20Overseas%20%28v5%29.pdf,https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/230000-policing-expands,https://jamestown.org/program/chinese-assistance-centers-grow-united-front-work-department-global-presence/,https://www.elcorreo.com/internacional/asia/operaciones-secretas-policia-20221009175227-ntrc.html,https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/onofficiele-chinese-politiebureaus-in-nederland?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sharebuttonnietleden&utm_source=twitter ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-fox-hunt-operation/6743252.html;Beijing Covers Up After China’s Overseas Police Spy Stations Are Exposed;;;;;;

Lavrov hailed Russia’s solidarity with Muslim nations:""Russia and the states of Islamic civilization are long-standing reliable partners, cooperating in ensuring security and stability, and in solving economic problems."" Russia may well have some “reliable partners” in Islamic nations – like-minded autocracies in Syria and Iran come to mind – but the impression that the Kremlin gets along well with all Muslims is misleading at best.Just ask Crimea’s Tatars, the Muslims who suffered persecution and exile under imperial Russia and the USSR, and who are now the target of atrocities under Vladimir Putin’s illegal occupation.Russia illegally annexed Ukraine in 2014, sending in troops with unmarked uniforms, staging a fake referendum and targeting Crimean Tatars as extremists. The main reason for the persecution? Disagreement with Russia's annexation.Russian authorities outlawed the representative body of the Crimean Tatars, called the Mejlis, and the Crimean Tatar TV channel was closed. Within a year, the U.K.’s Amnesty International had documented human right abuses against Tatars and opposition figures.In a March 2015 report, Amnesty cited seven reports of abduction, and another abductee found dead, apparently after being tortured. Amnesty documented the abduction of three Tatars and the head of the rights group Ukrainian House, Andriy Schekun, also tortured while being held.That was just the start. The Russian occupiers went after leaders of the Mejlis, forcing some to leave and arresting others, Amnesty reported in December 2016. John Dalhuisen, then the group’s Europe and Central Asia director, said:“As the most visible and cohesive group in Crimea opposed to the Russian occupation, the Crimean Tatar people have been deliberately targeted by the de facto local and Russian authorities in a wave of repression aimed at silencing their dissent and ensuring the submission of every person in Crimea to the annexation.” “Through the adoption wholesale of the repressive Russian legal framework in Crimea, which was in itself a violation of international law, the Russian authorities have prosecuted and forced into exile virtually all dissenting voices, including key leaders and activists within the Crimean Tatar community.”Dozens of Crimean Tatars have been imprisoned after being convicted of belonging to the Hizb ut-Tahrir Islamic group, banned in Russia and some other countries but not in Ukraine. Hizb ut-Tahir says it supports nonviolent efforts to bring Muslims together under a sole caliphate, but some members have been linked to attacks and plots in Russia, Europe and the Mideast.In its 2016 report, Amnesty called the accusations of membership in Hizb ut-Tahir “highly questionable.” Meanwhile, “No progress has been made in the investigations into the spate of enforced disappearances that followed shortly after the peninsula’s annexation,” Amnesty said.In a November 2017 report, Human Rights Watch echoed many of Amnesty’s findings and said persecution of Crimean Tatars by Russians had “intensified:”“Since Russia’s occupation began, Russian authorities and their proxies have subjected members of Crimean Tatar community and their supporters, including journalists, bloggers, activists, and others to harassment, intimidation, threats, intrusive and unlawful searches of their homes, physical attacks, and enforced disappearances. Complaints lodged with authorities are not investigated effectively. Russia has banned Crimean Tatar media and organizations that criticized Russia’s actions in Crimea…”Between 2014 and 2022, an estimated 10% of the Tatars left in Crimea fled to mainland Ukraine, while Russians poured into the peninsula, overhauling its ethnic makeup. By spring of 2018, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (a sister U.S. news agency to VOA and Polygraph.info) reported:“According to official Russian statistics, some 247,000 Russians have moved to Crimea since annexation. At the same time, about 140,000 people have left, mostly Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars who moved to the Ukrainian mainland. Ukrainian officials, however, say the real numbers are much greater – by hundreds of thousands.”Fast forward to today, after the Kremlin’s all-out war on Ukraine, and Putin’s “partial mobilization” to round up troops to replace the thousands of Russian soldiers who’ve been killed trying to take over first the entire country and now, at least some eastern and southern provinces.Occupying authorities in Crimea began to distribute draft papers, and Crimean Tatars became their main target. At least in the first days, they were mobilized to war disproportionately.One 27-year-old man from Simferopol fled on September 23 to avoid mobilization: “I didn’t serve in the army, but it was clear that Crimean Tatars were taken first of all, that raids had begun, to our places of compact residence,"" he told the Russian-language Belarusian opposition news site Zerkalo.Refat Chubarov is leader of the Mejlis, now exiled in Kyiv. ""About three thousand Crimean Tatars, avoiding mobilization, were forced to leave Crimea after September 23. But there are those who foresaw this and left earlier,"" he said.According to an October 4 report by Politico, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the round-up “a deliberate attempt by Russia to destroy the Crimean Tatar people,” while Chubarov said the mobilization amounted to an international war crime. Politico’s report said:“His legal reasoning is solid. The fourth Geneva convention prohibits an occupying power from compelling occupied populations to serve in its armed forces. Since annexation, Russia has already conducted 15 illegal conscription campaigns and enlisted over 30,000 people in Crimea. According to the Ukrainian general staff, at least 139 Crimeans have been killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine since February, and 22 are currently prisoners of war.”On November 1, the European Union (EU) confirmed the lopsided mobilization of Muslims on the peninsula. “Crimean Tatars are being deliberately and disproportionately targeted in the implementation of Russia’s order and reportedly forcibly involved in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, their traditional homeland,” said an EU statement.The Ukrainian nongovernmental group CrimeaSOS said that Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions says an occupier has no right to conscript people from occupied territories.“According to preliminary estimates, about 90% of the [mobilization] subpoenas in Crimea were received by Crimean Tatars. At the same time, Crimean Tatars make up 13%–15% of the population of the peninsula. Such a scale of mobilization can lead to a covert genocide of the Crimean Tatar people,” said Yevhen Yaroshenko, an analyst at CrimeaSOS.";https://sputniknews.com/20221024/lavrov-russia-intends-to-boost-cooperation-with-islamic-countries-1102583592.html,https://ctrcenter.org/en/o-krymskih-tatarah,https://religionmediacentre.org.uk/factsheets/factsheet-crimean-tatar-muslims-in-ukraine/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/07/revolving-door-persecution-crimea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2014/11/25/russias-crackdown-on-crimeas-muslims,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/what-the-banning-of-crimean-tatars-mejlis-means/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/01/dispatches-crimean-tatar-tv-station-forced-close,https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/17/crimea-human-rights-decline,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2016/12/crimea-in-the-dark-the-silencing-of-dissent/,https://www.rferl.org/a/crimea-tatars-lengthy-prison-terms/31746476.html,https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2019/11/13/7231794/,https://www.counterextremism.com/threat/hizb-ut-tahrir,https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/14/crimea-persecution-crimean-tatars-intensifies,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-accused-of-reshaping-annexed-crimea-demographics-ukraine/29262130.html,https://ru.krymr.com/a/news-tasheva-povestki-krym/32046774.html,https://krymsos.com/krymsos-mobilizacziya-krymskyh-tatar-mozhe-pryzvesty-do-genoczydu/,https://news.zerkalo.io/world/24263.html,https://korrespondent.net/ukraine/4529518-krym-posle-obiavlenyia-mobylyzatsyy-pokynuly-okolo-3-tysiach-krymskykh-tatar,https://www.politico.eu/article/murder-putin-draft-target-crimea-tatars/,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/ukraine-statement-spokesperson-russian-conscription-and-mobilisation-crimea_en,https://krymsos.com/ru/krymsos-mobilizacziya-krymskyh-tatar-mozhe-pryzvesty-do-genoczydu/,https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1a13044f3bbb5b8ec12563fb0066f226/2c777c1f24172394c12563cd0042c5aa,https://ru.krymr.com/a/news-povestki-krymskie-tatary-genozyd/32047683.html,https://krymsos.com/ru/krymsos-mobilizacziya-krymskyh-tatar-mozhe-pryzvesty-do-genoczydu/;Crimean Tatars and the Kremlin’s Oppression of Muslims;;;;;;

Videos and transcripts of the briefings are published on the Russian MoD Telegram channel.Polygraph.info collected the data from the briefings for the month of October to check total number of U.S.-provided HIMARS rockets and launchers the ministry “destroyed.” (The total does not include rockets reported as “intercepted.”)The U.S.-provided HIMARS has been widely credited as a game changer in the war, providing Ukraine with the ability to strike ammo and fuel depots behind Russian lines. Since the HIMARS units arrived, Ukraine forces have recaptured big swaths of territory.As we checked Russia’s accounting, something seemed amiss.Based on 31 briefings reviewed, the defense ministry claimed that at least 600 HIMARS rockets, six HIMARS launchers, and three ammunition depots with HIMARS rockets were destroyed.We’re judging that total as unsubstantiated for the reasons below, plus the fact that the ministry did not offer photographs of debris or any other forensic evidence to support its various counts.Polygraph.info asked Washington, D.C., think-tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) to assess the count of HIMARS destruction claimed by the ministry. The institute has been scrupulously monitoring the war and filing reports almost daily. The ISW’s Russia analyst Karolina Hird responded:“ISW cannot confirm specific counts of Ukrainian equipment destroyed by Russian forces. However, the Russian MoD does not typically provide visual evidence to corroborate these claims, and it is highly likely that the presented numbers are part of a larger effort on the part of the Russian MoD to overstate Ukrainian losses. The Russian MoD is likely falsifying data on Ukrainian losses in order to over-exaggerate Russian capabilities and present Ukrainian capabilities as increasingly degraded to damage morale.”The military blog Oryx also has been fly-specking arms and materiel losses for both Ukraine and Russia. In an October 28 report headlined, “Lost in Lies: Keeping Track of Russian Propaganda Claims,” the site noted numerous discrepancies. Oryx wrote:“Arguably the most amusing of Russia's claims is the amount of HIMARS it claims to have neutralized. Despite the fact that Ukraine only received 16 HIMARS by the 1st of October 2022, Russia miraculously claims the destruction of 19 HIMARS and the capture of another by that date.”“To provide evidence of the destruction of two HIMARS, the Russian MoD released footage of a precision missile strike against the second floor of a three-story office building, a rather unconvincing hiding place for truck-based rocket launchers.”In an overall assessment of Ukraine’s equipment losses published October 29, Oryx went further:“With Russia meanwhile outgunned and outranged on most fronts, the biggest threat to the operations of Ukrainian HIMARS, M270 and Western-donated tube artillery does not appear to be the destruction by Russian counter-battery fire or loitering munitions, but rather a lack of ammunition and barrel wear as a result of continued operations…”“And despite claiming the destruction of 20 HIMARS launchers, Russia has brought forward no evidence that supports the destruction of even a single HIMARS.”The HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, is a long-range, precision-fire launcher compatible with a family of MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System) munitions.HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, long-range precision launcher compatible with MLRS munitions. (Lockheed Martin handout)A Pentagon fact sheet from October 28 says that the United States has provided Ukraine with 38 HIMARS systems, but it does not mention the number of rockets sent to Ukraine.Russia’s claims about HIMARS prior to October 1 have been debunked by fact-checkers and ridiculed on social media. In August, Popular Mechanics magazine said the Russian claim that it had “hacked” into HIMARS rocket launchers system was most likely “a big fat lie.”“HIMARS does use an internal computer system, but it is unlikely it broadcasts signals detectable by Russian forces at range. The likelihood Russian forces have hacked HIMARS is right around zero.”The article also explained why HIMARS launchers and rockets are not an easy target for the Russians to destroy:“Could Russian counter-battery radars help destroy HIMARS systems? Absolutely. Counter-battery radars like the Zoopark-1 can detect six 13-foot-long rockets soaring into Russian-held territory. HIMARS is a wily target, however: the M142’s truck chassis, the use of GPS to quickly lay in a HIMARS firing position, and Ukraine’s excellent network of paved roads mean that a HIMARS truck can quickly ‘shoot and scoot’ before Russian artillery can rain down on its position.”The Ukrainians also faked the Russians out. In a fact check, Newsweek reported that:“According to The Washington Post, Ukrainian forces have tricked their Russian opponents into attacking several decoy HIMARS, which are largely made of wood.”Sure enough. The Post said:“After a few weeks in the field, the decoys drew at least 10 [Russian] Kalibr cruise missiles, an initial success that led Ukraine to expand the production of the replicas for broader use, said the senior Ukrainian official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters.”The Russian MoD regularly exaggerates its actions and makes false and misleading claims, past Polygraph.info fact checks show.On October 8, The Wall Street Journal reported from Ukraine about how HIMARS operators work in a stealthy fashion, casting more doubt on the Russian claims.“The supply chain for Himars units consists of factory-packaged rocket pods stashed at pickup points in the nearby countryside and usually hidden by foliage. A cargo truck deposits the camouflage-green pods – each a little bigger than a single bed – at a string of designated locations, not unlike a commercial delivery route.“Himars teams drive to the ammo drop spots, where a waiting three-man loading team removes spent pods and swaps in full ones within five minutes, using a crane integrated into the vehicle....“...Russian forces in Ukraine are lobbing dozens of shells per acre to hit one objective. Himars can do the job with one rocket carrying a 200-pound explosive warhead. Each Ukrainian Himars carries one six-rocket pod that can effectively land the punch of more than 100,000 lbs. of traditional artillery.”;https://t.me/mod_russia,https://www.understandingwar.org/,https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/10/lost-in-lies-keeping-track-of-russian.html,https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/10/how-is-russia-faring-against-nato.html,https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/himars.html,https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/mfc/documents/himars/TSM-Fast-Facts-HIdMARS.pdf,https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/28/2003104896/-1/-1/1/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-OCT-28.PDF,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-why-russia-trash-talks-us-gifted-himars-to-ukraine/6743442.html,https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2022/07/fact-check-russia-did-not-destroy-two-himars-on-july-6-2022.html,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a40958633/russia-claims-it-hacked-himars-rocket-launchers/,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/fact-check-did-russia-claim-it-destroyed-44-himars-launchers-in-ukraine/ar-AA11oipm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/30/ukraine-russia-himars-decoy-artillery/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-even-in-retreat-russian-defense-ministry-spins-a-phony-tale-of-success/6777423.html,https:// https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-unleashes-missile-terror-on-ukrainian-civilians-falsely-claims-military-targets/6785062.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-attack-what-attack-russia-denies-stinging-ukrainian-strike-on-crimean-airfield/6743450.html,https://www.wsj.com/articles/himars-transform-battle-for-ukraine-modern-warfare-11665169716;Russia Claims 600+ HIMARS Kills, Blowing Its Credibility to Bits;;;;;;

But what is clear is that during his campaign, Bolsonaro consistently misrepresented his stewardship of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest.Brazil's former President and presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks at an election night gathering on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Sao Paulo, October 30, 2022. (Carla Carniel/Reuters)Why does that matter?Because the Amazon, which covers an area about half the size of the U.S., is the world’s most important ecosystem. Its vast and diverse expanse of rivers, trees and vegetation sustains 10 percent of all species and 500 Indigenous communities. It produces about 6 percent of the world’s oxygen and is an enormous repository of carbon dioxide, the main cause of global warming.Scientists estimate the forest stores the equivalent of five or six years’ worth of human-made carbon. But now, thanks to uncontrolled destruction in the forest – from logging, fires, grazing, and dams – they say the Amazon may have flipped to a net contributor to global warming.The pace of that deforestation escalated rapidly under Bolsonaro and was a top campaign issue. Defending himself in September at the United Nations General Assembly, Bolsonaro said:“Our agribusiness is a source of national pride. In the Brazilian Amazon region, an area as big as Western Europe, more than 88.0 percent of the rain forest remains untouched and pristine, contrary to what is often reported by the mainstream national and international media.” But the claim that 88 percent of the Amazon is “untouched” is misleading.In fact, Alberto Setzer, a senior scientist at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, told the PBS NewsHour that perhaps less than half the rainforest remains untouched by development, and it’s possible there may really be only “10 percent or 15 percent left.”In September alone, the Amazon lost about 1,500 square kilometers to deforestation. That is roughly the size of greater London, according to The Guardian.“Environmental criminals raced to wreck the region before a possible change of president could bring Jair Bolsonaro’s era of destruction to an end,” the paper reported.Aerial view of a burnt area in the Amazon rainforest near the Lago do Cunia Extractive Reserve in northern Brazil, on Aug. 31, 2022. Experts say Amazon fires are caused mainly by illegal farmers, ranchers and speculators clearing land. (Douglas Magno/AFP)The Guardian said illegal loggers and ranchers were “scrambling” to clear rainforest as quickly as possible before da Silva has a chance to reverse Bolsonaro’s lax development policies.“The Climate Observatory watchdog said that [deforestation] figure was up 47.7% compared with last September and on a par with the destruction wrought in September 2019, the first year of Bolsonaro’s far-right administration. August saw an 81% rise in deforestation.“The number of Amazon fires rose 147% compared with September 2021, with more than 41,000 blazes [were] detected by satellites.“ ‘This is a very dangerous moment,’ warned Marcio Astrini, the Climate Observatory’s chief executive. ‘The Bolsonaro government is a forest-destroying machine.’ ”Bolsonaro has encouraged an increase in farming, ranching, and mining in the Amazon. The environmental group Greenpeace said that under his rule, deforestation has increased by about 53 percent in the last three years.National Public Radio (NPR) reported from Brazil that the government was doing little to punish those responsible for illegal logging and fires.""I've been fined three times"" for deforestation, one cattle rancher told NPR as he lit a blaze to clear grazing land. ""But it's a joke. Nobody around here ever bothers to pay.""Critics say Bolsonaro dismantled environmental agencies and silenced activists. His administration cut funds for IBAMA, a Brazilian agency that monitors environmental policy, by 30 percent in 2019. The Environmental Department’s budget in 2021 was the lowest it's been since 2010. And there were 20 registered killings of environmental activists in 2021.In his defense, Bolsonaro has pointed fingers at Indigenous people. In 2020, the Amazon was experiencing the worst fires in 10 years. That year, Bolsonaro told the U.N. General Assembly that “the fires practically occur in the same places, on the east side of the forest, where peasants and Indians burn their fields in already deforested areas.”Da Silva has pledged to protect the forest. He served two terms as president from 2003 to 2011 and was able to reduce deforestation. He said that conserving natural resources and protecting biodiversity could produce a profit and be beneficial to the pharmaceutical and beauty industries.Brazil’s largest agricultural organizations backed Bolsonaro’s campaign, as did many farmers.Polygraph.info has previously fact-checked some of Bolsonaro’s suspect environmental claims:Bolsonaro’s New Climate Change Promises Weren’t New At AllBolsonaro’s Son Covers For Agribusiness on Amazon DeforestationFantasy and Failure to Protect The Amazon Under Bolsonaro";https://www.voanews.com/a/lula-da-silva-wins-brazil-s-presidential-runoff-vote/6812487.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/world/americas/brazil-election-results-bolsonaro-lula.html,https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a28910396/amazon-rainforest-importance/,https://www.regnskog.no/en/what-we-do/the-amazon#:~:text=The%20Amazon%20rainforest%20stretches%20across,than%20half%20of%20the%20US.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/amazon-rainforest-now-appears-to-be-contributing-to-climate-change,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/future-of-amazon-rainforest-at-stake-in-brazils-presidential-election,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/07/brazil-rainforest-loss-climate-bolsonaro,https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/52098/bolsonaro-president-brazil-amazon-environment/,https://www.npr.org/2022/10/01/1126161100/brazil-election-amazon-deforestation-forest-fires,https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/52098/bolsonaro-president-brazil-amazon-environment/,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-un-assembly-brazil-idAFKCN26D1ZF,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/07/brazil-rainforest-loss-climate-bolsonaro,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/americas/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-wins-intl/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/americas/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-wins-intl/index.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-bolsonaros-new-climate-change-promises-werent-new-at-all-leaders-summit-on-climate/6742929.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-bolsonaro-son-covers-for-agribusiness-on-amazon-deforestation/6742897.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-brazil-fantasy-and-failure-to-protect-the-amazon-under-bolsonaro/6742748.html;On Exit, Bolsonaro Clearcuts A Swath of Amazon Distortion;;;;;;

Putin also introduced heightened security regimes in Russian-occupied Crimea and Russian regions bordering Ukraine.Putin sought to justify the martial law declaration as a response to Ukraine ostensibly ignoring the sentiment of the people in regions occupied by Russian troops. Last month, Moscow staged rigged referendums in four provinces to join Russia.“The Kyiv regime, as you know, refused to recognize the will and choice of the people, and rejects any proposals for negotiations. On the contrary, shelling continues; civilians are dying,” Putin said.“Neo-Nazis are frankly using terrorist methods – sabotage at vital facilities and arranging assassination attempts against local authorities. Like their ideological predecessors – Bandera, Hitler's accomplices – they are trying to create a bandit underground, sending sabotage groups into our territory.”People in Sevastopol, Crimea, watch on a large screen on September 30, 2022, as Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech after Moscow carried out sham referendums to justify annexing four regions of Ukraine. (Associated Press)Putin’s statement weaves together multiple falsehoods, including the widely debunked smear that Ukraine’s government and troops are neo-Nazis.The statement obscures Russia’s flagging military fortunes in parts of occupied Ukraine where Putin declared martial law. And it distracts from Russia’s renewed attacks on civilian infrastructure and long trail of war crime allegations in Ukraine.Russian law states that martial law can be declared in response to “aggression against the Russian Federation or a direct threat of aggression.”It defines “aggression” as “the application of armed force by a foreign state (group of states) against the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation or in any other way, incompatible with the [United Nations] Charter.”Putin has turned this on its head by imposing martial law inside Ukraine after launching a full-scale military invasion – in other words, as part of a Russian war of aggression against Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.According to the presidential martial law decree, Russian authorities may “implement measures to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation” and other Russia-backed forces; “carry out mobilization measures in the economic sphere;” and implement other “measures for civil defense.”In practice, these sweeping powers could allow resettling Ukrainians against their will, restricting their movements, seizing their property, imposing curfews and even forcibly conscripting them into the Russian army.Heightened security regimes, including restrictions on movement, have been enacted in the Russian regions of Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Krasnodar, Rostov and Voronezh, all adjacent to Ukraine.In September, Moscow conducted hastily organized referendums in four Ukrainian border provinces – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson— to justify its attempted land grab.Regarding the “will and choice” of residents, those referenda were characterized by Moscow-installed officials and armed soldiers going door-to-door to collect votes.Photos have surfaced showing soldiers standing over people filling out their ballots.Witnesses in recently liberated territories confirmed that Russian authorities had intimidated the referendum voters.A woman in Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia region, told the BBC she had to cast her vote “verbally” and then a soldier filled out the ballot and kept it.“The referendum is taking place in the occupied city of Kherson under the muzzle of an automatic rifle,” Galina Luhova, head of the Kherson City Military Administration, told The Washington Post from Ukrainian-held territory.“They ring the doorbell of apartments, knock down the doors of those who don’t open them and demand that people come out and put a mark that they agree to join the Russian Federation.”Many Ukrainians had already fled before the referendums, and Russia did not have full control over any of the regions at the time of the sham votes. Military hostilities were still ongoing in all four provinces.In Zaporizhzhia, for example, at the time the referendum was held, Ukraine still controlled Zaporizhzhia city, which had a pre-war population of 700,000.Two of the provinces where referendums were held, Luhansk and Donetsk, are already home to self-proclaimed “people’s republics” – Kremlin-controlled breakaway areas declared after Russia’s clandestine invasion of Crimea in 2014.Since Russian proxy forces took over those areas in 2014, the U.N. human rights watchdog said basic civil rights have been “severely restricted,” with pro-Ukrainian views essentially criminalized.The referendums are also illegal under Ukrainian and international law.Earlier this month, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution by a large majority calling on countries not to recognize Russia’s claim to the four regions.The resolution said the four regions were “temporarily occupied by Russia” in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence. The resolution demanded that Moscow reverse its “attempted illegal annexation.”The referendums corresponded with Russian setbacks on the battlefield.The same day referendums were announced, Putin also ordered a “partial” mobilization in Russia amid a Ukrainian counteroffensive that liberated more than 3,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. Russian troops were pushed out of the northeastern Kharkiv region, and advances continue elsewhere.Putin’s mobilization has sparked fear across Russia, triggering a mass exodus of Russian men of military age.Likewise, Putin’s martial law declaration comes amid signs that Ukraine’s campaign to retake Kherson, in southern Ukraine, is gathering steam.On October 18, the Moscow-installed deputy administrator of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, warned “the battle of Kherson” would soon begin, and told civilians to evacuate the city of Kherson “as soon as possible.”Vladimir Saldo, the head of the city’s Moscow-installed military–civilian administration, said 50,000-60,000 civilians would leave Kherson and surrounding towns in the coming days, along with occupation administration officials.The Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Russia of staging a propaganda show to convince residents of Kherson to flee by scaring them “with fake messages about the shelling of the city by our army.”Analysts say Putin is trying to compel more Ukrainians to fight in the Russian army. Russia-backed fighters in occupied areas of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region have already forced local men, including Ukrainian citizens, to join the military.Rights activists say Crimean Tatars, who are largely pro-Ukrainian, have disproportionately faced conscription in Russian-occupied Crimea.Forcibly conscripting Ukrainians and then forcing those conscripts to relocate to Russia would violate the Geneva Convention.";https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russian-attacks-on-civilian-infrastructure-in-ukraine-war-crimes-says-eu/2715197,https://www.reuters.com/world/un-finds-russia-responsible-vast-majority-potential-war-crimes-ukraine-2022-10-18/,http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/bank/17804,http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69632,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-martial-law-parts-ukraine-what-will-it-mean-2022-10-19/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-under-threat-of-nukes-moscow-stages-phony-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine/6756952.html,https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/sep/24/with-kalashnikov-rifles-russia-drives-the-staged-v/,https://twitter.com/GER_OSCE/status/1573563966676140033,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63013356,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/24/ukraine-putin-referendums/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/entire-villages-empty-out-ukrainians-flee-russian-annexation-refugees-say-2022-09-28/,https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/01/interactive-dialogue-oral-update-ukraine,https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107972,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492,https://www.rferl.org/a/russiams-anxious-mobilization-poll-levada/32059441.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/28/russia-turkey-partial-mobilization-ukraine/,https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1582472381519781888,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks/32090900.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks/32090900.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/pro-russian-separatists-step-up-forced-conscription-as-losses-mount,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/25/a-way-to-get-rid-of-us-crimean-tatars-decry-russia-mobilisation,https://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/crimea-conscripts-russia-continues-to-flout-the-geneva-conventions/;From Fake Elections to Martial Law: A Double Dose of Putin Duplicity;;;;;;

Russian equipment is being used, you know about it, with Russian designations.”That is false.Photographic and other forensic evidence, along with intelligence and media reports, confirm that since August Russia has deployed Iran-made Shahed and Mojaher drones.Ukraine’s Defense Ministry reported a Russian attack using Iranian Shahed-136s on September 13 in the city of Kupiansk, Kharkiv province. Russia tried to disguise the Iranian drones with the name M412 Geran-2, the ministry said.Ukraine recovered the wreckage of the drones and shared the photographic evidence of Iranian manufacture with news media. “Independent experts who examined photographs of recent drone wreckage from the Kharkiv region say that it appears to be Shahed-136, the latest evolution of Tehran’s delta-wing design,” The Wall Street Journal reported September 17.Ukrainian forces have destroyed 223 Iran-made Shahed-136 drones Russia deployed over Ukrainian towns and cities since September, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry reported on October 19.The National Resistance Center under Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces reported on October 18 that Iran sent at least 20 instructors into Ukraine to train and help Russian troops operate Iranian drones. “In particular, the instructors are deployed at the Chauda training ground, the Kirovskyi military airfield, and near Cape Tarkhankut [Crimea],” the center said.According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia purchased at least 2,500 drones from Iran. “[The] Shahed-136 has become a means for the Russian Federation to launch constant methodical attacks on the cities of Ukraine,” the Defense Ministry said in an October 19 report. The Ukrainian reports are corroborated by others. On October 12, the U.K. Defense Ministry reported that Russia had been using “Iranian manufactured” drones in Ukraine “since at least August 2022.”The Washington Post, citing “U.S. and allied security officials,” said on October 16 that Iran had begun supplying Russia with a “large number” of Shahed-136 and Mohajer-6 drones in August. Iran is “expanding its role as Russia’s military supplier,” now shipping weaponry that includes “two types of Iranian surface-to-surface missiles” and more drones, the newspaper reported. Iranian envoys finalized the deal in Moscow on September 18, the intelligence officials told the Post. Iran’s Shahed-136 drones are packed with explosives and preprogrammed to loiter overhead until they nosedive into a target. They are 11.5 feet long, eight feet wide, weigh 440 pounds, have a 50-horsepower engine, and a maximum range of 1,500 miles. They are not equipped with cameras, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said.In an October 17 report, PBS explained how Russia benefits from using Iranian drones as a budget option:“At a mere $20,000 apiece, the Shahed is only a tiny fraction of the cost of a more conventional, full-size missile. For example, Russia’s Kalibr cruise missiles that have seen widespread use in the nearly eight months of war cost the Russian military about $1 million each.“At such a low cost, the Shahed can be deployed in massive numbers to saturate a target, whether it’s a fuel depot or infrastructure and utilities like power or water stations.”And Shahed-136 drones can be difficult to intercept. Russia has used Iranian drones against civilian areas and infrastructure, National Public Radio quoted Ukrainian and foreign officials as saying. On October 17, a Russian drone attack in Kyiv killed at least four people. That same day, Russia used Iranian drones and Russian missiles to attack civilian infrastructure in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy, killing three and wounding nine. Thousands were left without electrical power, CNN reported. The Guardian newspaper reported on October 19 that it costs Ukraine more to shoot down the Iranian drones than it does for Russia to deploy them.“With the price of the Iranian-made Shahed-136s standing at €20,000 to €50,000 for each vehicle, the total cost to Russia of the failed drone attacks unleashed on Ukraine in recent weeks is estimated by military analysts at the NGO Molfar to be between $11.66m (£10.36m) and $17.9m (£15.9m) …""“The estimated cost to Ukraine stands at more than $28.14m (£25m), according to the analysis, which is based on open sources. The data includes drones launched between 13 September and 17 October.”In a TV address on October 18, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy system, attacking at least 10 regions in recent days. “We should remember that the very fact of Russia's appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin's recognition of its military and political bankruptcy. For decades, they've been spending billions of dollars on their military-industrial complex, and in the end, they went to bow to Tehran to get rather simple drones and missiles,"" Zelenskyy said.Zelenskyy said Russia’s attacks over a week had ""destroyed"" 30% of Ukraine's power stations and caused ""massive blackouts"" across the country.For its part, Iran denies selling weapons to Russia and claims neutrality in the conflict.However, on October 18, Reuters cited “two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats” who confirmed their country’s weapons supply to Russia. “A deal was agreed on Oct. 6 when Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, two senior officials from Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards, and an official from the Supreme National Security Council visited Moscow,” Reuters reported.According to Reuters, Iran’s latest deal with Russia also includes Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, which are “short-range surface to surface ballistic missiles capable of striking targets at distances of between 300 km and 700 km (186 and 435 miles).”The United States, which with European allies has spent billions supplying Ukraine with arms, has pledged to make it harder for Iran to send weapons to Russia.""We will continue to take practical, aggressive steps to make these weapons sales harder, including sanctions, export control actions against any entities involved,"" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said on October 18, Reuters reported.";https://ria.ru/20221018/bespilotniki-1824832788.html,https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/iranian_shahed_136_kamikaze_drones_already_used_by_russia_first_photos_and_specs-4207.html,https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-use-of-iranian-kamikaze-drones-creates-new-dangers-for-ukrainian-troops-11663415140,https://en.defence-ua.com/news/ukraines_air_force_reports_staggering_number_of_downed_iranian_made_shahed_136_kamikaze_drones-4585.html,https://www.facebook.com/sprotyv.official/posts/pfbid02hoWK9T5dDrFcGGsZDkCmyo6xmkdNvfSgSLr97kuDTxDXQs12gzFxSesM2L8NLdxrl,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3595454-iranian-instructors-help-russians-launch-kamikaze-drones-from-crimea-kherson-region.html,https://en.defence-ua.com/news/ukraines_air_force_reports_staggering_number_of_downed_iranian_made_shahed_136_kamikaze_drones-4585.html,https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1580056524092678144?s=20&t=b8pi0YNjfelqC4Wa-KZMDw,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/10/16/iran-russia-missiles-ukraine/,https://mil.in.ua/en/news/ukrainian-military-showcased-captured-iranian-mohajer-6-uav/,https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/irans_shahed_136_kamikaze_drone_how_to_identify_look_and_sound_from_the_air_video-4313.html,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-explosive-drones-strike-ukraines-capital-4-killed,https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2022/10/17/1129422759/kyiv-russian-drone-attack-october,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/europe/kyiv-kamikaze-drone-strikes-intl/index.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/financial-toll-ukraine-downing-drones-vastly-exceeds-russia-costs#:~:text=The%20estimated%20cost%20to%20Ukraine,13%20September%20and%2017%20October,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine,https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/russia-ramps-up-attacks-on-key-ukrainian-infrastructure-targets-150945861573,https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-strike-several-energy-power-station-ukraine-cause-outage-zelenskyy/ ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-evidence-shows-russia-is-using-iranian-drones-against-ukraine-/6775472.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-iran-agrees-ship-missiles-more-drones-russia-defying-west-sources-2022-10-18/,https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-iran-agrees-ship-missiles-more-drones-russia-defying-west-sources-2022-10-18/,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-take-practical-aggressive-steps-make-sale-iranian-drones-harder-2022-10-18/;Russia Denies Using Iranian Drones.

How a Chinese Think Tank Distorted Russia’s Annexation of Crimea;2022-10-18;polygraph;;"On October 10, Wang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, published an article in which he defended Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.Wang visited Russia in September, including Crimea, where he met with top officials of the Black Sea peninsula’s Russia-imposed government. He boasted on his blog that more than 160 Russian media outlets reported on “the first trip by a Chinese think-tank scholar to Crimea.”He said the trip had “great academic value in understanding the developments of Russia-Ukraine conflict, deeply grasping the future situation of Russia and other significant issues.”In his article for Guancha.cn, Wang showered praise on Russian-ruled Crimea for what he described as its “rapid economic growth in eight years.” He also lamented the “rocky future” Crimea faces due to the ongoing war, which Russian President Vladimir Putin launched against Ukraine in February.He described what happened to Crimea eight years ago as follows:""After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the issue of who owns the Crimean Peninsula became a long-standing dispute between Ukraine, Russia and the local government of Crimea. Crimea had been constantly calling for full independence or returning to Russia, with the situation around it tightened and loosened until March 16, 2014, when there was a referendum in Crimea and over 96% of the voters favored Crimea’s accession to Russia.“Russia said it respected and supported the choice of the Crimean people. Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Crimea’s accession to the Russian Federation.""That characterization of Russia's invasion and takeover of Crimea is misleading.Crimea has been part of Ukraine since 1954, when then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast from what was then the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or RSFSR, to what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, or UkrSSR. The presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union’s legislature, formally authorized the transfer. Historians are still debating the motivation behind the transfer. Prior to that, Crimea had been part of Russia since 1783, when Russian Tsarina Catherine the Great annexed the peninsula from the Ottoman Empire after the invading Russians defeated the Ottoman forces.Before the tsarist annexation, however, Crimea had existed as the Crimean Khanate, an Ottoman Empire protectorate, for more than three centuries starting in the mid-1400s. According to some historians, the name “Crimea” was from the language of the Crimean Tatars, “a Turkic ethnic group that emerged during the Crimean Khanate,” The Washington Post reported in 2014.During the time Crimea was ruled by imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union before 2014, the indigenous Crimean Tatars, along with large numbers of Greeks, Armenians and other ethnic groups, were persecuted and expelled from the peninsula by both regimes. Crimea eventually became predominantly Russian, reaching 60% of the Crimean population in 2001, with Ukrainians constituting 24%, after the waves of deportations of the indigenous populations.According to official Crimean, Soviet and Ukrainian census data, the Crimean Tatars’ share of the peninsula’s population dropped from 34.1% in 1897 to zero in 1959, climbing back up to 12% by 2001.The Washington Post explained the drastic drop of the Crimean Tatar population to zero in 1959 this way:“Once the [Soviet] Red Army retook Crimea [from Nazi Germany] in 1944, it forcibly deported the entire population of Crimean Tatars to Central Asia as punishment for collaboration with German forces. Almost half are believed to have died along the way. The Tatars, who had been on the peninsula for centuries, were not allowed to return to Crimea until the end of Soviet Union.”Crimea formally became part of the Soviet Union in 1921, when it was established as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The republic was transformed into the Crimean Oblast in 1945, an administrative region of Soviet Russia, until its transfer to Soviet Ukraine in 1954.Khrushchev at General Assembly meeting in New York, Oct. 1, 1960. (AP)“Crimea was part of Soviet Ukraine for longer than it was part of Soviet Russia,” wrote Orysia Lutsevych, research fellow at Britain’s Chatham House think tank.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, “many apparently expected new President Boris Yeltsin to demand that Crimea be returned to Russia,” The Washington Post noted. But that didn’t happen.Even though 60% of Crimea’s population was ethnic Russian, 54% of the peninsula’s voters favored remaining part of Ukraine in a December 1991 Ukrainian referendum on independence.“It was a majority, but the lowest one found in Ukraine. Following a brief tussle with the newly independent Ukrainian government, Crimea agreed to remain part of Ukraine, but with significant autonomy,” wrote The Washington Post.Crimea became the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (ARC), the newly independent Ukraine’s only self-governing region. The ARC had its own constitution, legislature and prime minister.It remained that way until Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, which followed the ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych amid a wave of Ukrainian populist protests.Masked men wearing Russian-style combat uniforms without identifying insignia and carrying Russian weapons moved into Crimea on February 27, a few days after Yanukovych fled to Russia. The locals called them “little green men.”These troops seized control of Crimea. Putin and other Russian officials initially denied they were Russians and called them “self-defense units” organized by Crimean locals. A year later, however, Putin admitted on television the units were actually Russian forces he had ordered into Crimea.A referendum was staged – under the Russian military occupation – on March 16, 2014, in an internationally condemned attempt to legitimize permanent annexation of Crimea to Russia.“Crimea's March referendum on leaving Ukraine for Russia ostensibly garnered 97% support, but it occurred in a rush, without international monitors, and under Russian military occupation,” Vox news reported in 2014.“A draft U.N. investigative report found that critics of secession within Crimea were detained and tortured in the days before the vote; it also found ‘many reports of vote-rigging.’ Had the referendum been held in a transparent and legal manner, it's not clear which way the vote would have gone.”As Reuters reported in March 2014, Crimean voters could only choose between full or partial takeover by Russia, without an option to remain part of Ukraine.Chatham House’s Orysia Lutsevych reported that the Kremlin “substantially inflated voter turnout.”“While it said that 82% of voters had cast their ballots, a member of Russia’s presidential Civil Society and Human Rights Council reported that turnout was likely to have totaled 30–50%. Election fraud such as multiple voting was also reported,” Lutsevych wrote in May 2021.“Public opinion polling prior to Russia’s aggressive disinformation campaign spoke clearly in favor of Crimea remaining part of Ukraine,” Lutsevych said, citing a May 2013 opinion poll conducted by the Baltic Surveys/Gallup on behalf of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. non-profit organization.The survey showed that 53% of respondents wanted Crimea to remain part of Ukraine and only 23% said they would rather have Crimea separated from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.Backed by 100 members including the United States and European Union, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on March 27, 2014, condemning the referendum as invalid. China abstained in the voting.China has toed a fine line when it comes to Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for Ukraine's territorial integrity since the war began. According to an article last month in the Chinese Communist Party paper Global Times:""Cui Heng, an assistant researcher at the Center for Russian Studies at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday that China has adhered to its principle of stressing countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity, which means we respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries."" 'Just like China's position on Crimea in 2014, we always adhere to the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,' Cui said.""In response to questions on whether China would recognize the referendum results in Crimea, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said at a media briefing on March 17, 2014 that China always respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries.""";https://www.guancha.cn/WangWen/2022_10_10_661366_s.shtml,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uawq0oZy0zrM1K7IqLrXIQ,https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/119638.pdf?v=9c6737c4342d1343676044065d49f510,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/02/separatism-in-ukraine-blame-nikita-khrushchev-for-ukraine-s-newest-crisis.html,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-did-russia-give-away-crimea-sixty-years-ago,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/02/27/to-understand-crimea-take-a-look-back-at-its-complicated-history/,https://www.businessinsider.com/crimea-demographics-chart-2014-3,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/02/27/to-understand-crimea-take-a-look-back-at-its-complicated-history/,https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/05/myths-and-misconceptions-debate-russia/myth-12-crimea-was-always-russian,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/02/27/to-understand-crimea-take-a-look-back-at-its-complicated-history/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/02/27/to-understand-crimea-take-a-look-back-at-its-complicated-history/,https://www.rferl.org/a/from-not-us-to-why-hide-it-how-russia-denied-its-crimea-invasion-then-admitted-it/29791806.html,https://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/18088560/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know,https://www.businessinsider.com/richard-balmforth-crimea-vote-doesnt-offer-no-option-2014-3,http://www.president-sovet.ru/members/blogs/bobrov_e_a/problemy-zhiteley-kryma-/,https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/05/myths-and-misconceptions-debate-russia/myth-12-crimea-was-always-russian,https://www.iri.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/iri.org/2013%20October%207%20Survey%20of%20Crimean%20Public%20Opinion,%20May%2016-30,%202013.pdf,https://press.un.org/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm;Will of the Crimean People?

An airstrike killed over 50 people at a school and [refugee] site, violence has forced 340,000 people to flee in Afar and Tigray, and fighting makes it very difficult to reach people with assistance.”Esleman Abay, a journalist at the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), responded to Power by accusing USAID of supporting the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which is fighting Ethiopian government forces.“It's USAID arm & fund TPLF terror group for all this crisis? tons of @USAID food aid for civilians found in trenches which was meant for Tigray civilians not TPLF. @SamanthaJPower's @USAID kept supporting & feeding TPLF terrorists,” he tweeted.That is false.Abay accompanied his tweet with a video showing sacks of USAID foodstuffs that appeared to have been plundered. But the presence of those USAID provisions does not indicate USAID is arming, supporting or funding the TPLF. USAID supplies, like those from other relief organizations, have been looted during the conflict. There is no evidence showing the United States is aiding the TPLF. In fact, the U.S. has threatened all parties to the conflict with sanctions.Tigray People’s Liberation Front forces have been at war with the Ethiopian National Defense Forces since November 2020. In March 2021, Ethiopia confirmed that neighboring Eritrean troops had joined its side of the fighting.A truce brokered in March broke down in August. Renewed peace efforts have stalled.The U.N. Commission of Human Rights Experts last month warned “civilians in northern Ethiopia are at risk of further atrocity crimes.” Its chair said “the humanitarian crisis in Tigray is shocking, both in terms of scale and duration.”The United States says more than 5 million people in Ethiopia need humanitarian aid, and as many as 900,000 in the Tigray region are living under famine conditions, “more than anywhere else in the world today.”The U.S. and others have tried to support civilians caught in the conflict. Assistance has not been extended to active combatants, although Tigray forces have stolen humanitarian aid and other resources.In late August, USAID said Tigray forces looted its warehouses in the neighboring Amhara region, which Tigray rebels entered after fighting renewed that month.“We do have proof that several of our warehouses have been looted and completely emptied in the areas, particularly in Amhara, where TPLF soldiers have gone into,” said Sean Jones, USAID's mission director in Ethiopia.Polygraph.info reached out to USAID to clarify the nature of that proof. USAID did not reply by the time of publication.Tigray forces also seized 12 fuel tankers from the World Food Program, imperiling its ability to deliver humanitarian aid, the United Nations said.In April, USAID said the U.S. “is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the northern Ethiopia response efforts, and we remain committed to helping all people in need across Ethiopia.”“The U.S. has provided more than $995 million in humanitarian assistance to northern Ethiopia since the crisis began, including more than $885 million through USAID and nearly $110 million through the U.S. Department of State,” USAID said.Eysa Mohammed, 15, sits in her house after sustaining injuries on her right leg from an explosive that was left near her house in the aftermath of the fight between the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Kasagita town, Afar region on February 25, 2022. (Tiksa Negeri/Reuters)But only a sliver of assistance for civilians is getting through.“Less than 10 percent of the needed humanitarian supplies, however, have reached the Tigray region over the past month due to obstruction of aid access. Let me repeat that: less than 10 percent of needed supplies,” a senior White House official said in September 2021.Earlier this month, the European Union called the Tigray situation “one of the worst man-made humanitarian crisis in the world.”Power said earlier that obstruction by all sides had hampered efforts to get aid to those in need. During a visit to Ethiopia in August, she warned of the perils of “dehumanizing rhetoric.”Ammunition is seen next to a tank destroyed in a fight between the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Kasagita town, Afar region, on February 25, 2022. (Tiksa Negeri/Reuters)The Ethiopian government has called U.S. actions in response to the Tigray crisis “misguided” and “regrettable.”Some Ethiopian government supporters have conflated U.S. criticism of the Ethiopian military’s actions in Tigray and role in the humanitarian catastrophe with support for the TPLF.Critics likewise cite U.S. relations with the TPLF, which ruled Ethiopia from 1991 to 2018, as evidence that the U.S. supports Tigray rebels.But U.S. support to Ethiopia, including roughly $1 billion in annual aid, continued under the administration of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.The U.S. is threatening sanctions against the warring parties to encourage a peaceful solution.On September 17, President Joe Biden approved an executive order “establishing a sanctions regime to increase pressure on the parties fueling this conflict to sit down at the negotiating table and, in the case of Eritrea, withdraw forces.”;https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-resumption-of-hostilities-in-northern-ethiopia/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict/ethiopian-pm-confirms-eritrean-troops-entered-tigray-during-conflict-idUSKBN2BF1NT,http://www.fides.org/en/news/72917-AFRICA_ETHIOPIA_Peace_talks_postponed_to_a_date_to_be_defined_to_stop_the_war_in_Tigra,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/09/un-experts-warn-potential-further-atrocities-amid-resumption-conflict,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/17/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-ethiopia/,https://www.state.gov/delivery-of-humanitarian-assistance-in-tigray/,https://www.icrc.org/en/document/ethiopia-icrc-resumes-aid-convoys-tigray-after-six-months-0,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-agency-says-tigrayan-forces-looted-aid-warehouses-ethiopias-amhara-region-2021-08-31/,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125442,https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/apr-21-2022-united-states-provides-nearly-313-million-additional-humanitarian-assistance-northern-ethiopia,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/17/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-ethiopia/,https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/usaid-chief-concerned-by-dehumanising-rhetoric-ethiopia-amid-war-tigray-region-2021-08-04/,https://apnews.com/article/africa-ethiopia-government-and-politics-afbee66ac235a6333437838082e6be1b,https://borkena.com/2022/09/05/washington-ethiopians-protest-united-states-tplf/,https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/08/30/us-backed-tplf-resumes-war-in-northern-ethiopia/,https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-12-2021-united-states-provides-additional-humanitarian-aid-and-airlifts,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/17/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-ethiopia/;USAID Isn’t Arming and Funding Tigray Rebels in Ethiopia;;;;;;

W. Bush authorized “Operation Just Cause,” sending additional troops to the Panama Canal Zone to arrest Noriega on drug trafficking charges.Thirty-three years later, Russia’s top diplomat cited the U.S. action in Panama as justification for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including widespread bombardments of non-military targets, the deaths of thousands of civilians and the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory.On October 3, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed Russian lawmakers as they took up treaties to absorb parts of Ukraine in violation of international law:“Washington has never hesitated to use force under fabricated pretexts anywhere in the world, using false claims to justify its actions such as the need to protect the lives and well-being of U.S. citizens ... “Before the occupation of Panama, then U.S. President George H.W. Bush … told the dramatic story about one fatally shot American soldier, another one arrested, and yet another one beaten, whose wife, allegedly, underwent rough interrogation and was threatened with rape.“This was enough to invade these countries and install governments that suited Washington.”That effectively fictionalizes the Noriega story by omission and oversimplification, while extending a line of Soviet disinformation hatched in the Cold War climate of the time.References to false precedents are a favorite tool of Russian propaganda. Polygraph.info previously debunked Moscow’s comparison between this war and the NATO-United Nations intervention in Kosovo in 1998-99 to stop the Serbian attacks on Albanian Muslims.Lavrov’s version of the Panama conflict is another flawed example.Start with Noriega, an iron-fisted, corrupt general who ruled Panama like a mob boss from 1983 until U.S. troops captured him. From the 1950s, Noriega had collaborated with U.S. diplomats and intelligence agencies. Over time, the relationship deteriorated as he dealt with other spy agencies and drug cartels.In February 1988, U.S. grand juries in Miami and Tampa charged Noriega with racketeering, smuggling cocaine and marijuana, money laundering and taking some $5 million in bribes from the Medillin cartel in Columbia.Prosecutors said Noriega allowed the cartel to run operations out of Panama after U.S. authorities had cracked down.In April of 1988, Noriega infamously waved a machete over his head at a rally and vowed never to buckle to U.S. pressure to remove him.After the indictments, Noriega’s downfall played over a matter of months. As Britannica.com recounts, he’d been no paragon of democracy, either:“Despite the presence of international observers (including former U.S. president Jimmy Carter), Noriega annulled the results of the May 1989 Panamanian presidential election when it appeared that it had been won by a wide margin by Guillermo Endara, the opposition civilian candidate. In addition to overturning the results of the election and installing a former classmate, Francisco Rodríguez, as a puppet president, Noriega had Endara and his supporters beaten in the streets. “The Organization of American States (OAS) responded by calling for a ‘peaceful transfer of power’ to an elected government, and U.S. Pres. George Bush dispatched 2,000 troops to U.S. bases in the Panama Canal Zone. In the meantime, having survived a coup attempt in October, Noriega persuaded the Panamanian National Assembly to name him “maximum leader” on December 15, 1989. “At his behest the Assembly also declared that a state of war existed between Panama and the United States.”That appeared to put the safety of approximately 35,000 American citizens in Panama at risk.That risk was real. Here is what happened the next day, according to an official U.S. military history:“During the evening, four U.S. officers, apparently on a Saturday night outing, took a wrong turn and approached a PDF checkpoint at the Comandancia. At about [9 p.m.], guards from the Panama Defense Force stopped the car and tried to force the officers outside. “When the Americans refused to leave their vehicle, a PDF soldier loaded a magazine into his AK-47; the car pulled away. As the guard fired, the car sped off, only to approach another PDF guard post. The soldiers there also began firing. Their bullets wounded three of the officers in the car; one of them, Marine First Lieutenant Robert Paz, died of his wounds in the Gorgas Military Hospital.“While the U.S. officers were trying to escape, a U.S. couple who witnessed the incident, a junior U.S. naval officer and his wife, were brought to a police station for questioning. Interrogators kicked the officer in the groin, hit him in the mouth, and pointed a gun at his head. Other PDF members forced his wife to stand against a wall while they groped her; she collapsed.”Valid treaty obligations also were at stake regarding the U.S.-built Panama Canal.In 1903, the United States and Panama signed a treaty granting the U.S. exclusive canal rights and establishing the Panama Canal Zone. The canal was completed in August 1914, and the U.S. eventually established bases and a garrison to protect the zone and ensure free travel of ships.In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos, who preceded Noriega, signed treaties under which the canal was to revert to Panamanian control by 2000. Bush cited the need to make good on those treaties when announcing the plan to go after Noriega in December 1989.By comparison, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and annexations of Crimea and other areas arguably violate treaties in which the Kremlin pledged to respect Ukraine’s boundaries.So, Lavrov’s allegations of “fabricated pretexts” and “false claims” are both bogus and hypocritical.After ousting Noriega, the U.S. didn't annex Panama. In 1999, it handed over the canal as promised.Noriega was captured and taken to the United States, where he was tried and sentenced to decades years in prison. In 2010, Noriega was extradited to France and sentenced to even more time in a conviction for money laundering.In 2011, France extradited him to Panama, where he was sentenced to 60 years for crimes committed during his reign. Noriega asked Panamanians for forgiveness in 2015, then died two years later at age 83 after a brain tumor.We presume Lavrov is not defending a special Russian prerogative to launch invasions based on fabrications.

Red Square, Moscow, September 30, 2022. (AFP)On October 2, Putin tasked Andrey Klishas, a ranking member of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia’s parliament, with amending the nation’s constitution to include the occupied Ukrainian territories. The council is scheduled to vote on the package October 4.Klishas wrote on the Telegram messaging service that Ukrainian will lose its status as an official state language. “Nobody is going to ban the Ukrainian language, but it won’t be granted an official status either,” Klishas said, according to the Russian Defense Ministry’s Zvezda TV channel.On October 2, Russia’s Constitutional Court in Moscow ruled the annexations legal, even though they violate international law and have been condemned by the United Nations secretary general and many countries. The next day, the parliament ratified the annexations “with more votes in favor than deputies present,” the independent Russian outlet Meduza reported.Russian news outlets said the currency in these occupied/annexed areas will be the ruble, armed militia will become part of the Russian military, and Russian federal administrators, judges and prosecutors will be installed by June 1, 2023.Russia now recognizes national borders where the front lines of conflict were on the day of each referendum, the new amendments say. That border was short-lived in Lyman, a city in partly occupied Donetsk province that Ukrainian forces recaptured on October 2.Notably, one of the false pretexts Russia cited before its all-out invasion of Ukraine in February was a complaint that the Ukrainian state was run by Nazis who were “banning” the Russian language and committing atrocities against Russians.In late September, the head of the Russian occupation administration in Ukraine’s Kherson region also promised that Ukrainian would have “equal” status with the Russian language.Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya raises his hand against a Security Council vote on a draft resolution opposing Russia's annexation of war-occupied Ukraine territory, Sept. 30, 2022.(AP)On September 30, Russia vetoed a U.N.

Danish and Swedish prime ministers cited “deliberate action.”The undersea pipelines are 745 and 767 miles long. Russia hasn’t been pumping gas into Nord Stream 1, citing repairs. Germany had frozen completion of the newer Nord Stream 2 project just days before Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24.But it was weeks before then that Biden, at the White House with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, was asked if Germany would “pull the plug” on Nord Stream 2 “if Russia invades Ukraine.”In that event, Biden said, “There will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.”Scholz added, “[W]e have intensively prepared everything to be ready with the necessary sanctions if there is a military aggression against Ukraine.”So, the context was about whether Germany and the U.S. would block the project to bring economic pressure to bear on Russia, which prior to the war provided half of Germany’s natural gas (and 40 percent of Europe’s, much of it transiting Ukraine).Pulling the plug is entirely different from blowing things up.On February 23, after Russia’s “recognition of independence” of two breakaway Ukrainian regions in Donbas, Germany halted the licensing and certification of Nord Stream 2, and the U.S. announced new sanctions on the pipeline and its partners.As Biden promised, that shut down the project.U.S. officials have called the suggestion that the United States or allies damaged the pipelines “absurd.”On September 28, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said about Zakharova’s representation of Biden’s comment:“So, look, the President said that [Nord Stream 2] wouldn’t become operational and we would work with Germany on that. And he was right, because Germany took the step in February to freeze it, which was widely reported by all of you. And so that is what the President was talking about at that time.”On September 28, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said, “The idea that the United States was in any way involved in the apparent sabotage of these pipelines is preposterous.”The Kremlin has denied suggestions that Russia was behind the pipeline leaks as “predictable and stupid” while claiming the U.S. has benefited from supplying Europe with liquified natural gas.On September 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Turkish leader Recep Erdogan, that the ""unprecedented sabotage"" of the pipelines was ""an act of international terrorism,"" and that Russia intends to call an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the situation, Russia's TASS news agency reported.The next day, Putin went inched further toward specifically blaming the United States and Western allies. During a speech announcing that Russia would annex areas of Ukraine it has partially occupied based on rigged referendums, Putin said: ""Sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons: They moved on to sabotage. It is hard to believe but it is a fact that they organized the blasts on the Nord Stream international gas pipelines, which run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea ... It is clear to everyone who benefits from this,"" Reuters reported.With Russian gas supplies off the table, European Union countries have been scrambling to stockpile and find replacement supplies ahead of winter. A goal is to cut consumption by 15 percent by year’s end, in part by turning down thermostats and turning off the lights.Though Russia isn’t pumping natural gas to Europe, high prices thanks to its war have helped the majority state-owned Gazprom, which posted record revenues and profits in August.Why might Russia sabotage pipelines that aren’t even in use but could be an avenue for putting pressure on a freezing Germany this winter? Analysis abounds.Writing in Time on September 29, European energy analyst Suriya Jayanti said:“Natural gas prices did jump on news of the explosions … but beyond that very short-term consequence there is little leverage to be gained by the sabotage. That lack of logic is the single factor making anyone pause before attributing the explosions to Russia – they just don’t make much strategic or tactical sense….“That pause is brief, however, given that Russia has been blowing up or shelling energy targets across Ukraine, too. … Given the targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine, just one incidence of which plunged five million Ukrainians into darkness, it seems likely that Putin bombed Nord Stream 1 and 2 simply to terrorize Europe.""Calling Russia the ""chief suspect,"" analysts at the Center of Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank said on September 29:“In recent years, Russian activity around undersea Euro-Atlantic infrastructure has increased. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as NATO, have issued particular warning of Russian submarine presence near undersea cables in the North Atlantic Ocean. ...“However, the Kremlin’s motives for conducting an attack on its own pipelines are not fully clear. Russia may be warning and signaling to Europe and the West that it is willing to target civilian infrastructure. Attacks on gas pipelines today could foreshadow attacks on undersea data cables tomorrow.“Additionally, by severing the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Europe, Russia could be signaling to Europe that it is Russia, not Europe, that has decided to cut energy ties and decouple and that there is no going back. This would seem to contradict the conventional wisdom that Russia was hoping Europe will buckle this winter due to rising energy costs and will seek to pull back from sanctions and pressure Ukraine to negotiate. But Putin may have realized that such hopes were fanciful — especially as Europe has found ways to restock its gas supply for the winter — and is now resorting to new tactics.""";https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63057966,https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/083122-high-gas-prices-push-russian-gazproms-h1-profit-to-record-high,https://news.yahoo.com/coons-nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-143409022.html,https://factba.se/biden/transcript/joe-biden-press-conference-olaf-scholz-germany-february-7-2022,https://www.dw.com/en/us-announces-sanctions-on-nord-stream-2/a-60891522,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/09/28/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-september-28-2022/,https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-september-28-2022/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63071552?at_campaign=KARANGA&at_medium=RSS&curator=biztoc.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/09/28/nord-stream-gas-pipeline-blown-up-the-latest-twist-in-the-crazy-energy-sector/?sh=9369bdc7a024,http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69460,https://kremlin-ru.translate.goog/events/president/news/69460?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US,https://www.reuters.com/world/extracts-putins-speech-annexation-ceremony-2022-09-30/,https://time.com/6218125/russia-gas-pipelines-energy-war/,https://www.csis.org/analysis/security-implications-nord-stream-sabotage;Biden Did Not Threaten to Sabotage Nord Stream Pipelines as Russian Disinfo Claims;;;;;;

(Akhtar Soomro/Reuters)Amid Pakistan’s woes, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed for engagement with China on debt relief and restructuring “so that Pakistan can more quickly recover from the floods.”That prompted a harsh response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.“The Chinese government has provided 400 million RMB ($55.6 million) worth of humanitarian assistance, and China’s civil society has also lent a helping hand. We will continue to do our utmost to help the Pakistani people overcome the floods and rebuild their homes at an early date,” he said.“China and Pakistan have had fruitful economic and financial cooperation. The Pakistani people know it best. Instead of passing unwarranted criticism against China-Pakistan cooperation, the U.S. side might as well do something real and beneficial for the people of Pakistan.”Wang’s misleading deflection failed to address the issue Blinken raised about Pakistan’s debt to China. It also ignored the fact that the United States has provided Pakistan with much aid and assistance in the face of the natural disaster.First, Pakistan’s estimate of flood-related damages – $30 billion – is equal to the amount of money the country owes to China.According to Bloomberg, that is around a third of Pakistan’s total external debt. And some of this debt is tied up in what Fortune magazine described as “opaque” emergency loans.China, the world’s largest bilateral lender, has given a total of $32.8 billion in emergency loans to debt-laden Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Argentina, Fortune reported, citing information from AidData at The College of William & Mary in Virginia.Largely, these loans have been used to prevent default related to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – Beijing’s $1 trillion trade and diplomatic program to connect with Eurasia and Africa with Chinese-built infrastructure projects, Fortune said, citing a report by the Financial Times calling China an emerging competitor to the Western-led International Monetary Fund.Fortune reported:""[R]esearchers have found that the bulk of China’s overseas lending — around 60% — is now to low-income countries that are currently mired in debt distress, or at high risk of it. Beijing’s pivot to short-term rescue lending highlights its growing role as an emergency lender of last resort, rendering it an alternative to the Western-backed International Monetary Fund (IMF).""Experts are concerned about what comes next, as many of the nations that took loans from China are facing an extraordinary debt crunch amid an era of inflation and climate change.""Pledged Chinese investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a flagship project of the BRI – has been valued at $62 billion.VOA’s sister news agency, Radio Free Europe\Radio Liberty, reported in August that “the viability of some projects have been brought into question in Pakistan.”That includes a deep-sea port China is building in Gwadar under a 40-year lease agreement signed in 2017. The presence of Chinese fishing ships at Gwadar and their impact on local fisherman have prompted protests there.Commentators told the U.K.’s Financial Times newspaper that China’s rescue lending is only worsening problems for debt-distressed countries.“I see these as a major impediment to crisis resolution,” Gabriel Sterne, a former senior IMF economist told the Times. “The suspicion is that countries seek out the loan to avoid going to the IMF, which demands painful reform.”In May, the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized democracies called on China to “contribute constructively” to help “low-income countries facing debt-sustainability challenges.”Meantime, the United States is doing something beneficial.Blinken recently announced the U.S. was giving Pakistan an additional $10 million in food security assistance, on top of the $56 million already marshaled for flood-related humanitarian assistance.Blinken noted that the U.S. has “been able to send about 17 planes full of supplies, like food and materials to build shelters, tents, tarps.”The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which is providing more than $50 million of the total assistance pledged by the U.S. so far, deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) “to lead the U.S. government’s humanitarian response efforts in Pakistan.”USAID said “[t]he United States is the single-largest humanitarian donor to Pakistan.”Local workers unload relief sent by the U.S. government at Noor Khan Air Base in Islamabad on September 9, 2022. (Pakistan Foreign Ministry Press Service/via AP)“Since 2009, the U.S. government has committed over $5 billion in civilian assistance to Pakistan and over $1 billion in emergency humanitarian response,” the website of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Pakistan reports.“The United States has also donated more than 61 million vaccine doses to Pakistan, in addition to more than $78 million in direct and in-kind support to help Pakistan respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.”Notably: “U.S. assistance to Pakistan is always in the form of grants, which does not add to Pakistan’s debt burden or balance of payments challenges.”China routinely attempts to dismiss or distort U.S. assistance to developing countries.Chinese diplomats often use crude memes to argue that Beijing is a force for good in the world, and the U.S. is solely a force for violence.";https://apnews.com/article/floods-pakistan-united-nations-climate-and-environment-256f6b5e82035ea449791e76ce775bb8,https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-pledges-2-billion-for-flood-ravaged-pakistan-/6762469.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/us-asks-pakistan-to-seek-debt-relief-from-china-after-floods?sref=8HTMF4ka,https://www.yahoo.com/video/china-gave-tens-billions-secretive-191658920.html,https://www.imf.org/en/home,https://cpecwire.com/connectivity/cpec-news/chinas-62-billion-bet-on-pakistan/,https://www.rferl.org/a/china-debt-crisis-belt-road-initiative-kyrgyzstan-pakistan-/31970756.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-falsely-denies-gwadar-protests-as-fake-news/6743211.html,https://www.ft.com/content/f27a543b-7678-4130-9c05-db0492d9c240,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-20/g-7-urges-china-to-contribute-constructively-on-debt-workouts,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-additional-10-million-for-flood-victims-in-pakistan-urges-debt-relief-from-china/6765013.html,https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-9-2022-united-states-providing-20-million-additional-humanitarian-assistance-pakistan,https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-9-2022-united-states-providing-20-million-additional-humanitarian-assistance-pakistan,https://pk.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/us-assistance-to-pakistan/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-beijing-lies-about-a-photo-to-smear-blinken-s-outreach-in-africa/6743454.html;How China Misrepresented U.S. Flood Aid to Pakistan;;;;;;

I cleaned the old weapons myself, figured out the bulletproof vests myself, and found specialists who could help me with this,” Prigozhin said.“From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later acquired the name BTG [Battalion Tactical Group] Wagner.”Prigozhin also confirmed Wagner’s involvement in conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Africa and Latin America, something he had repeatedly denied.Prigozhin’s connections to Wagner have been widely reported, yet he went so far as to sue journalists for saying he created the company. Prigozhin denied any connections to the Wagner Group as recently as February 16, when he sued the Dutch investigative journalism group Bellingcat in a Moscow court, demanding a retraction.“The contested publications contain false information that the plaintiff [Yevgeny Prigozhin] is affiliated with the Wagner Group, finances it, and that the Wagner Group belongs to him,” the court filing stated.Wagner Group mercenaries participated in the 2014-2021 fighting by Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists in Donbas, and in the Syrian civil war on the side of the dictator Bashar Assad. Wagner troops have seen action in Libya, the Central African Republic and Mozambique as well. They have been accused of looting and abuses.As recently as February 12, Prigozhin applied to the General Court of the European Union with a demand that the EU Council retract wording describing him as sponsor of Wagner Group and justifying sanctions against him.“Yevgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin] has always denied and continues to deny the existence of any links between him and any militarized or paramilitary structures,” Concord said.In June 2021, Prigozhin sued Alexei Venediktov and Vitaly Ruvinsky, the heads of the Ekho Moskvy radio station, for claiming on air that the businessman was owner of the Wagner Group.Prigozhin first denied his involvement with the Wagner Group in November 2017 in an interview with the Russian website RBK.“We are not aware of the activities of the organization you mentioned. Yevgeny Viktorovich [Prigozhin] also asked me to convey that he was extremely surprised by the very fact of the existence of this company and had nothing to do with its activities,” the Concord company said. Prigozhin has denied not only his ties with the Wagner Group, but also the company’s involvement in the war with Ukraine.In July 2022, the independent Russian news site Meduza, based in Latvia, published an investigation into Russian mercenaries in Ukraine. Prigozhin demanded that the authors be criminally prosecuted.His representatives cited the questions Meduza sent him alleging that the Wagner Group was taking part in the Russian-Ukrainian war.“The questions asked contain the initial information of their authors that a certain private military company, Wagner, is directly involved in the special operation conducted by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine,” Concord said, referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.According to analysts and news reports, Wagner is closely connected to the Russian Defense Ministry. Its mercenaries use Russian military bases, are transported by Russian military aircraft, are served by military medical services, and receive passports as Defense Ministry employees, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank, reported in September of 2020.In September, a video emerged showing a man resembling Prigozhin inviting convicts in the Russian Mari El prison colony to sign up as mercenaries. Later, Prigozhin, told critics that “either PMCs (private military contractors) and prisoners, or your children,” would be fighting in the Ukraine war.Prigozhin himself is a former criminal who did time in Russia in the 1980s. He has been on U.S. sanctions lists starting in December 2016, when he was designated for assisting with Moscow’s military provocations in eastern Ukraine.In February 2018, a federal grand jury charged Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg firm allegedly controlled by him and involved in propaganda and disinformation campaigns as well as hacking, for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Concord disputed the charges, which later were dropped.In December 2018, the U.S. Treasury “took action against Russian actors that attempted to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections” and imposed sanctions on Russia’s RIA FAN (Federal News Agency) for links with the Internet Research Agency. Treasury targeted the private planes, yacht and front companies associated with Prigozhin.The U.S. list of sanctioned companies associated with Prigozhin expanded after he tried to evade sanctions by using several front companies. As of early 2021, according to the U.S. Treasury, “Prigozhin continued to coordinate messages in an attempt to spread disinformation about the United States government.”The 2018 indictment landed Prigozhin on the FBI's ""most-wanted"" list.";https://archive.ph/hkO3z,https://ria.ru/20220926/vagner-1819431778.html,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/08/14/pmc-structure-exposed/,https://vk.com/concordgroup_official?w=wall-177427428_1194,https://ria.ru/20220216/isk-1773055260.html,https://vk.com/concordgroup_official?w=wall-177427428_873,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/11/17/inside-wagnergate-ukraines-brazen-sting-operation-to-snare-russian-mercenaries/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-wagner-africa-car/6743465.html,https://www.interfax.ru/world/821718,https://rtvi.com/news/prigozhin-podal-v-sud-na-venediktova-iz-za-zayavleniya-o-chvk-vagnera/,https://t.me/aavst2022/2993,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/15/11/2017/5a0c04e49a7947d9f6a12c2e,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/15/11/2017/5a0c04e49a7947d9f6a12c2e,https://meduza.io/news/2022/07/13/evgeniy-prigozhin-poprosil-sk-vozbudit-ugolovnye-dela-protiv-redaktsionnogo-direktora-meduzy-tatyany-ershovoy-i-zhurnalistki-lilii-yapparovoy,https://meduza.io/news/2022/07/13/evgeniy-prigozhin-poprosil-sk-vozbudit-ugolovnye-dela-protiv-redaktsionnogo-direktora-meduzy-tatyany-ershovoy-i-zhurnalistki-lilii-yapparovoy,https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/band-brothers-wagner-group-and-russian-state,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/europe/russia-wagner-ukraine-video.html,https://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2018/09/21/1733712.html,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/06/29/prigozhin-s-criminal-past-straight-from-the-source,https://meduza.io/news/2016/12/20/prigozhin-i-kovalchuk-popali-pod-amerikanskie-sanktsii,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-how-the-kremlin-propagandized-bolton-remark-about-planning-coups-/6743426.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-justice-dept-abandons-prosecution-of-russian-firm-indicted-in-mueller-election-interference-probe/2020/03/16/5f7c3fd6-64a9-11ea-912d-d98032ec8e25_story.html,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/19/12/2018/5c1a86fb9a7947ac5e581452,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm787,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628,file:///C:/Users/tdetz/Downloads/Yevgeniy%20Vicktorovich%20Prigozhin3-1.pdf;After Years of Falsification, Putin's ‘Chef’ Owns Up to Running Russian Mercenaries;;;;;;

(AFP)Iran claims Amini died of heart failure. The regime says accusations that she was injured in police custody are fake news.The Islamic Republic News Agency said:“The western media and influencers during the recent days spent tremendous efforts aimed at aggravating the dimensions of unrests in Iran and claimed that the death of Mahsa Amini was due to the harsh dealing of the police forces against her, while the Iran Police publishing [sic] a videoclip showed that her death was due to a heart attack, proving the false news broadcasted by the western media and the anti-Iranian press.”The claim that the video clip of Amini collapsing in a detention center “proves” she died of a heart attack is false.Without an independent autopsy, the exact cause of Amini’s death remains unknown. But there is evidence indicating Iran’s morality police beat her for wearing a hijab in a way they found improper.Iranian police released the CCTV video, which shows a woman they identify as Amini interacting with a female police officer at the detention center. After a brief conversation, Amini presses her hands to her head, grips a chair and collapses.Iran has said the video refutes claims Amini was struck by police, and that she “lost her life due to heart failure.”But witnesses did not claim she was beaten in the detention center. Rather, they allege she was beaten inside a police van after being arrested outside a metro station in Tehran on September 13.Erfan Mortezaei, Amini’s cousin, told the U.K.’s Sky News that Amini lost her vision and fainted at the center as the result of “a concussion from a blow to the head.""Mortezaei said a witness inside the van said Amini “was tortured and insulted” during the trip to the police station.Amini’s father also claims the CCTV footage was doctored. Doctored or not, the footage alone does not prove Amini died of heart failure.By releasing the footage, Iranian authorities appear to be implying that if Amini had been severely injured by police, she would not have been able to walk in the detention center, interact with others, or otherwise appear “normal.”But head trauma can express itself in many ways. Take the sport of boxing, where most fatalities result from traumatic brain injury. There have been cases where boxers appeared to recover after bouts and were able to walk on their own and conduct post-fight interviews, only to later die from brain injuries.The Mayfield Clinic, which specializes in brain and spine surgery, said of traumatic brain injury:“At first the person may appear fine, but their condition can decline rapidly. After the initial impact occurs, the brain undergoes a delayed trauma — it swells — pushing itself against the skull and reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood. This is called secondary injury, which is often more damaging than the primary injury.”Of course, this also does not prove Amini died of a head injury. However, other evidence that Amini suffered a head injury has surfaced.A person holds a sign depicting Mahsa Amini as they take part in a protest following her death, in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, on September 23, 2022. (Christian Mang/Reuters)The U.K.’s Guardian newspaper reported that a computed tomography (CT) scan “of Amini’s head showed a bone fracture, hemorrhage, and brain edema, seemingly confirming that she died due to being struck on the head.”The source of those images and other medical documents is an unnamed hacktivist group that purportedly leaked the scans to the London-based Persian language broadcaster Iran International.The documents have not been independently verified as Amini’s.Iran International reports that the medical documents and images “corroborate earlier accounts” from hospital sources that Amini died of brain trauma following “multiple blows” to the head.Iran International has faced criticism of bias for financial links to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s major Mideast rival. The station maintains it is editorially independent.Other verified photographs of Amni at Kasra Hospital in Tehran, where she died, do appear to show she was bleeding from an ear and had bruising under the eyes.A top Iranian medical official wrote to the president of Iran's Medical Council that apparent injuries visible in the photos were “consistent with the symptoms associated with a head injury and the resulting bleeding,” not a heart attack.Doctors on social media observed that “bleeding from her ear could be [from] a blow to the head,” reported VOA’s sister news organization, Radio Free Europe\Radio Liberty.Iran’s interior minister claimed Amini “apparently had previous physical problems.” But her family said Amini was not suffering from a known medical condition. They said hospital staff did not allow them to see her body.Iran has tried to pin growing internal unrest sparked by Amini’s death on the West. With more than 75 demonstrators reportedly killed in clashes with security forces, internet access has been curbed, and journalists covering the events were arrested.State media pundits claim the United States is manipulating Amini’s death to “incite ‘regime change' in Iran.”On September 22, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iran’s morality police “for abuse and violence against Iranian women and the violation of the rights of peaceful Iranian protesters.”";https://en.isna.ir/news/1401070401732/Iran-criticizes-US-West-s-double-standards,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-mahsa-amini-west-death-protests-backlash-grows-rcna49363,https://en.irna.ir/news/84889658/Iranian-police-releases-footage-of-young-woman-died-after-arrest,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62954648,https://news.sky.com/story/mahsa-amini-was-tortured-and-insulted-before-she-died-in-police-custody-in-iran-her-cousin-says-12705226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20948404/,https://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3b7501dc1c51d2783f3f50b7d9270483,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-51183445,https://mayfieldclinic.com/pe-tbi.htm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/mahsa-amini-iran-protests-enter-third-day-after-kurdish-womans-death-in-custody,https://www.iranintl.com/en/202209195410,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/31/concern-over-uk-based-iranian-tv-channels-links-to-saudi-arabia,https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/israel-iran-saudi-arabia-battle-for-supremacy-in-the-middle-east/,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-amini-death-head-injury-doctor/32042587.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-amini-death-head-injury-doctor/32042587.html,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-62954648,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/middleeast/iran-protests-mahsa-amini-father-internet-blackout-intl-hnk/index.html,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/09/27/world/iran-protest-death-toll/,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-issues-license-to-expand-internet-access-for-iranians/6760646.html,https://www.insidevoa.com/a/voa-denounces-the-arrests-of-multiple-journalists-in-iran-/6764111.html,https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/09/25/689825/US-manipulates-Mahsa-Amini-death-regime-change-Iran,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0969;Video of Mahsa Amini’s Collapse Does Not Prove She Died of a Heart Attack;;;;;;

(Reuters)Li signaled support for Russia’s ongoing attacks on Ukraine and blamed the war on the West. He called for a strengthening of “exchanges” regarding “external interference, sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.”“The United States and NATO directly forced their way onto Russia's doorstep, which concerns Russia's national security and the safety of its people's lives. Under such circumstances, Russia has taken measures that it thinks should be taken,” Li said. “China understands that and provides coordinated responses on different aspects.“In my opinion, it can be said that Russia was forced into a corner, and under such circumstances, Russia took a counterattack to safeguard the core interests of the country.”The claim that Russia was “forced into a corner” or otherwise compelled by the West to attack Ukraine is false.Li’s comments ignored several key facts that undermine the idea that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was in response to actions by NATO, a defensive alliance.Ukraine removed its legal prohibition against joining NATO only after Russia annexed Crimea and took other aggressive actions against Ukraine in 2014.A recent Reuters report showed that Ukraine offered to take future NATO membership off the table in exchange for peace, a plan Putin rejected.Putin has telegraphed his imperial intent, consistently denying Ukraine’s right to exist.Moscow’s aggression prompted Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, and Russia’s response was muted.It is Russia’s actions that prompted NATO countries to beef up defenses.So, let’s unpack this.On September 14, Reuters, citing three people close to the Kremlin, reported that Putin’s chief envoy on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, had hammered out a provisional deal with Kyiv as the war began that would have satisfied “Russia's demand that Ukraine stay out of NATO” in exchange for peace.But Putin rejected the offer and “expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory,” the sources told Reuters.Russia’s war against Ukraine actually started long before in 2014, when it annexed Crimea and fomented conflict in Ukraine’s eastern provinces, clandestinely helping create “independent” people’s republics that are puppets of the Kremlin.As Polygraph.info previously reported, Ukraine had dropped its pursuit of NATO membership in 2010 and passed a law affirming its status as a military non-aligned country, a status that precludes joining NATO.Ukraine only abandoned its non-aligned status in December 2014, after Russian troops occupied Crimea and became directly engaged in fighting on Ukrainian soil, including during the Battle of Ilovaisk in August-September 2014.Still, NATO has never offered Ukraine a Membership Action Plan — the official pathway for entry to NATO.Moreover, it was Russia’s attacks on Ukraine that prompted NATO to bolster its defensive forces in response, and the U.S. and its European partners to later spend billions on arms and ammunition for Ukraine.“In response to Russia's use of military force against Ukraine, NATO deployed four multinational battle groups to the Baltic States and Poland in 2016. Before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no Allied troops in the eastern part of the Alliance,” NATO said.The recent decisions by Sweden and Finland to join NATO also show that Russia’s concerns over NATO expansion are overblown.Ukrainian servicemen pass a heavily damaged building in a recaptured area of Izyum on September 14, 2022. (Leo Correa/AP)Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finnish leaders said in May that “Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.” Days later, Sweden’s foreign minister signed the country’s application to join NATO.Finland and Sweden officially applied to join NATO on May 18.But while Russia first warned of “retaliatory steps” against the two countries, it later signaled that their NATO membership would not be an issue.“We don't have problems with Sweden and Finland like we do with Ukraine,” Putin said in late June.What problems does Russia have with Ukraine?According to some Russian pundits, and Putin himself, Ukraine is wrong to believe it has a right to exist as an independent country with a unique national identity.In 2008, Putin told then-U.S. President George W. Bush: “You have to understand, George, Ukraine is not even a country.”In a July 2021 article titled, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,” Putin wrote “that Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole.” He also claimed “there is no historical basis” for “the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians.”Underscoring Russia’s expansionist ambitions, Putin said, “Kyiv simply does not need Donbas,” the region in eastern Ukraine where Russia helped establish separatist republics and which Russian forces now occupy.On the eve of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, Putin argued in a televised address that Ukraine never had “real statehood,” adding that the country was an integral part of Russia’s “own history, culture, spiritual space.”A Ukrainian soldier helps his wounded fellow soldier on the road in the freed territory of the Kharkiv region, Ukraine, on September 12, 2022. (Kostiantyn Liberov/AP)Putin also claimed that Ukraine could be called “Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's Ukraine,” falsely arguing that Ukraine was the Soviet dictator’s creation.In a June speech in which he compared himself to Peter the Great, Putin claimed that through the war in Ukraine, he, like the imperial Russian monarch, was returning Russian lands.In July, Russia signaled its intent to grab even more territory in southern Ukraine.Moscow’s plans to hold bogus referendums on joining Russia in occupied Ukrainian territory were reportedly thwarted by Ukraine’s recent advances on the battlefield.Top Russian officials and media pundits regularly use genocidal language concerning Ukraine.A prominent Russian state media pundit compared Russia’s actions in Ukraine, some of which are alleged war crimes, to removing “worms” from a sick cat.Vladislav Surkov, a former chief Kremlin ideologue who advised Putin on matters concerning Russia’s clandestine actions in eastern Ukraine, said in 2020 that “[t]here is no Ukraine. There is Ukrainian-ness,” which he defined as “a specific disorder of the mind.”Such rhetoric is normalized on Russian state TV and other state media, despite an extremism law that criminalizes incitement of hatred against ethnic groups.;http://duma.gov.ru/en/news/55208/,https://www.politico.eu/article/putin-russia-no-problem-finland-sweden-join-nato/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-war-began-putin-rejected-ukraine-peace-deal-recommended-by-his-aide-2022-09-14/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-concocts-nato-war-fantasy-to-justify-russias-ukraine-invasion/6743430.html,https://www.derechos.org/peace/russia/doc/ukr2229.html,https://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/14/battle-ilovaisk-details-massacre-inside-rebel-held-eastern-ukraine-282003.html,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/115204.htm,https://apnews.com/article/sweden-finland-sauli-niinisto-4ede1942b679dd15bd3021f9b194cbec,https://www.thelocal.se/20220517/swedish-foreign-minister-signs-nato-application/,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_195468.htm,https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220629-live-ukraine-war-to-take-centrestage-at-crucial-nato-summit,https://news.yahoo.com/what-the-west-doesnt-understand-about-russia-or-ukraine-215609030.html,https://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181,https://time.com/6150046/ukraine-statehood-russia-history-putin/,https://communistcrimes.org/en/mythbuster-no-lenin-did-not-create-ukraine,https://www.britannica.com/place/Russian-Empire/The-reign-of-Peter-the-Great,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hailing-peter-great-putin-draws-parallel-with-mission-return-russian-lands-2022-06-09,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-moscow-64ded5439b69c0fdea84d5d2d625e805,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-delays-referendums-occupied-regions-setback/32028735.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/09/russia-putin-propaganda-ukraine-war-crimes-atrocities/,https://www.justsecurity.org/81789/russias-eliminationist-rhetoric-against-ukraine-a-collection/,https://www.newsweek.com/russian-tv-ukraine-no-longer-exists-simonyan-russia-1-deworming-1726014,https://ukraine.un.org/en/188268-new-report-un-human-rights-shows-shocking-toll-war-ukraine,https://www.rferl.org/a/in-first-interview-since-departure-russia-s-former-gray-cardinal-questions-existence-of-ukraine/30456301.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/09/russia-putin-propaganda-ukraine-war-crimes-atrocities/,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-anti-extremism-law-blunt-instrument-navalnu-jehovahs-witnesses/31230149.html;While Putin Trumpets Imperial Designs on Ukraine, China Falsely Blames the West for War;;;;;;

Special Rapporteur Richard Bennett meets Taliban authorities. (Taliban/Handout)Afghan authorities rejected the findings, with Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid responding on Twitter.“The report of the United Nations representative Richard Bennett on human rights is biased and far from reality,” he claimed. “Today, there is no threat to the life of women in Afghanistan … no one dishonors Afghan women.”That is false. Taliban rights abuses, especially targeting women and girls, have been extensively documented by the U.N., rights groups and think tanks that follow Afghanistan.The U.N. report debunks the Taliban’s claims that the rights of Afghan people are protected under the Islamic law in effect since the country’s 2004 democratic constitution was suspended and government and civil society oversight dissolved:“Although the Taliban have repeatedly claimed that their administration is inclusive, it lacks gender, ethnic, religious, political and geographical diversity.""The grand assembly of 4,500 religious scholars and clerics held in Kabul from 30 June to 2 July 2022, was a further missed opportunity to establish an inclusive political process. The all-male assembly was devoid of diversity and achieved little more than reaffirming support for the de facto authorities.""Under this patriarchal system, women and girls have “rapidly disappeared from all spheres of public life,” the report says. Instead, they have been victims of domestic violence, forced into child marriages, suspended from high schools and had professional licenses revoked.Mandatory hijabs, a ban on wearing colored clothing, required male chaperones and other restrictions on women’s freedom of movement “significantly affect their ability to access health care and education, earn a living, seek protection and escape situations of violence,” the report states.“Despite their pledge to allow all Afghan girls to return to school after 21 March 2022, they announced two days later that girls’ secondary schools would remain closed until policies and uniforms followed principles of Islamic law and Afghan culture. The Special Rapporteur notes with grave concern that this prohibits girls from attending secondary schools. Girls’ secondary schools are closed in 24 of 34 provinces, forcing about 850,000 girls from school.”Adding a human dimension, the U.N. report gives voice to Afghans Bennett interviewed during his visit in the country.“A young woman the Special Rapporteur met expressed her frustration, “During the last months, I wake up with tears. I tell myself this is a nightmare because the future looks darker every day. I had dreams to study finance and open my own clothing business. I wanted to travel to many countries and learn from them and bring this knowledge back to Afghanistan. From one day to another, mine and my friends’ lives and dreams were hijacked. I want the international community to remember that without them, we, the girls of Afghanistan, can never win this battle, alone.”The Taliban's Islamic law permits girls under the age of 15 to be married, leading to a “surge of child marriages,” Bennett reported. On top of that, an alarmingly high number of female suicides and homicides requires “urgent study,” the report said.“The Special Rapporteur met with women human rights defenders who had been harassed, detained and ill-treated for peaceful protest. Others have become victims of violence, enforced disappearance, ill-treatment and torture. To be released, some had to make video confessions, declare in writing they would not engage in any activities seen as harmful to the authorities and had their identity documents confiscated.”The economic consequences for women have been harsh, the U.N. report says:“The restrictions on Afghan women are disproportionately affecting their ability to sustain themselves, thereby further diminishing their enjoyment of other basic rights. In early 2021, about 17,369 women-owned businesses were creating over 129,000 jobs, over three-quarters held by women, and many more unregistered women-owned businesses operated in the informal economy.“By March 2022, 61 percent of women had lost their job or income generating activities; the current restrictions are estimated to contribute to an immediate economic loss of between US$600 million and US$1 billion (about 3 to 5 percent of GDP). In the informal sector, women can no longer take products to market due to movement restrictions and the closure of many women’s markets.”The report also says that women have been excluded from the country’s decision-making circles and judicial system, where they had made substantial inroads under Afghan democracy.On July 19, for example, the Taliban’s Ministry of Finance said on Twitter that women had been asked to “voluntarily nominate” male relatives to replace them at their workplaces.In August, Human Rights Watch said the international response to the Taliban’s treatment of women has been “inadequate” and called for more concrete steps to right the wrongs.In July, Amnesty International issued a report on the plight of Afghan women under the Taliban, titled “Death In Slow Motion.”Bennett’s report did not focus exclusively on women. Other findings included:Reprisal killings: Although the Taliban claimed to have called a general amnesty after the April 15, 2021, takeover of Kabul, the report cites at least 160 extrajudicial killings of former Afghan government defense and security force members through June 2022:“Residents of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces reportedly discovered over 100 bodies of men dumped in canals and other locations. The number killed is likely much higher, as family members of victims are often reluctant to report for fear of retribution.”Minority rights: Ethnic Hazara Afghans, who practice a different form of Islam, are routinely persecuted. The report cites allegations of forced eviction, summary execution, religious taxation and enforced disappearances. People with disabilities or different sexual orientations face discrimination.Children suffering: This group may be suffering the greatest harm under the Taliban. The report says “an estimated 9.2 million children [are] suffering malnutrition. Many families are utilizing harmful coping strategies, including the sale of children, child marriage, child labor and decreasing spending on healthcare and education.”Freedom of speech and media: The right to independently report the news is sharply curtailed, and 84 percent of women media workers have been forced out of jobs. Six journalists have been killed, four wounded and more than 100 detained. Arbitrary rules are used to censor, abuse and intimidate journalists, and 15 provinces have seen 40 percent to 80 percent of their news outlets close.";https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/A_HRC_51_6_AdvanceEditedVersion-EN.docx,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/09/afghanistan-un-expert-warns-human-rights-crisis-presages-authoritarianism,https://twitter.com/zabehulah_m33/status/1569396819938910208?s=46&t=M2gkw6X6dl9I_2Pl2lAlyA,https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-women-rights-taliban-freedoms/32024050.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/afghanistan-international-community-must-urgently-action-upon-the-un-special-rapporteurs-recommendations/,https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/statement/2022/08/statement-meticulously-constructed-policies-of-inequality-afghanistan-one-year-on,https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/afghanistan,https://www.csis.org/analysis/women-owned-businesses-afghanistan-are-jeopardy,https://twitter.com/afghanistanmof/status/1549377432033058817?s=20&t=G2BvD5D6hB88oh-JgZYJoA,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/08/16/afghan-women-need-global-action-halt-taliban-abuse,https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/5685/2022/en/;Taliban Falsehoods After Blistering Report on Women’s Rights;;;;;;

(Kostiantyn Liberov/AP)Late last month, state parties to the international Biological Weapons Convention began a formal consultative meeting following a request from Russia in June. The basis: Russia claims the United States is secretly developing bioweapons in Ukraine.While that accusation has been repeatedly debunked, on September 12, Putin confidante and Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, Nikolay Patrushev, repeated the allegation that dozens of U.S. biolabs in Ukraine endanger Russia.“The network of biolaboratories created by the U.S. around our country also poses a threat to the safety of the population. There were more than 30 of them in Ukraine alone,” Patrushev said.“During the special military operation, many facts were revealed confirming that such laboratories developed components of biological weapons and their means of delivery.""Problem is, there is no actual evidence that the United States has ever developed biological weapons in Ukraine. Of course, Russia says there is, as in March, when the ambassador to the United Nations raised the issue before the Security Council, claiming with alarm that new documents had been found in occupied Ukraine.Here is how the ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, trumped up supposed evidence into a nefarious-sounding tale of conspiracy in May:“As we take from the documents of Project 3007 ‘Monitoring of the epidemiological and environmental situation regarding hazardous diseases of aquatic origin in Ukraine’, Ukrainian specialists, supervised by American scientists, systematically collected water samples in a number of major Ukrainian rivers, including the Dnepr, Danube and Dniester, as well as in the North Crimean Canal.“The goal was to determine the presence of particularly dangerous pathogens, including cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E pathogens, and draw conclusions about their possible waterborne spread to assess the damage properties of the selected samples. All the collected strains were subsequently exported to the USA.“A question begs itself – what for? Why does the United States need a collection of dangerous pathogens that can spread in the rivers of that region?” How about the explanation that it could be used to prevent an outbreak of disease?Russian biologists inside and outside of Russia said the bioweapons research claim was an outright fabrication, the Intercept’s Robert Mackey reported.The biologists, speaking at ""risk to their safety,"" said the documentation presented by Russia merely showed the innocent collection of pathogens for benign public health research, not for military purposes.Moscow State University microbiologist Dr. Yevgeny Levitin told Sibir Realli, an outlet of the VOA’s sister organization Radio Free Europe\Radio Liberty, that the “deliberate lie” by Russia would “become obvious to any person who takes the trouble to simply carefully read the documents attached to the allegation of the creation of biological weapons in Ukraine.”“That's how propaganda works. The [Russian] Ministry of Defense made a false, unfounded statement – and now, if I talk to people, 90 percent of them will say: ‘Bioweapons were made in Ukraine,’” Levitin said.Experts writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists likewise said outside specialists and independent journalists had found no evidence U.S. research in Ukraine supported “anything other than peaceful activities.”Nor is the work hidden. “[U]kraine, unlike Russia, makes annual reports to the Biological Weapons Convention on its activities, known as confidence building measures, publicly available,” they wrote.Take the case of German researchers, who openly collaborated with scientists in Ukraine to study bat parasites that potentially posed a risk to human health. Those parasites were shipped to Germany for DNA study and to identify pathogens.The researchers presented their findings at a German Veterinary Society conference in 2021, the journal Science reported.The German researchers were then surprised to find that their “very basic epidemiological research” was presented by Russia as proof of a “Western-funded bioweapons effort.”“It’s very strange to be blamed for an almost absurd thing,” parasitologist Cornelia Silaghi, a leader of the collaboration, told Science. “The Russians must know it’s a lie.”Montreal journalist Justin Ling reported that Moscow used the idea of destroying U.S. biolabs as one pretext for invading Ukraine in February.In fact, biosecurity experts said it is Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities that “have raised the risk of an escape of disease-causing pathogens,” Reuters reported.The bioweapons conspiracy theory misrepresents the intent and workings of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Biological Threat Reduction Program, which started in the 1990s to “reduce legacy threats from nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons left in the Soviet Union’s successor states, including Russia.”The U.S. State Department notes that Russia initially “was the foundational partner of the threat reduction program.” Contrary to Moscow’s claims, the purpose is to “reduce and eliminate the risk of biological weapons development and proliferation,” the U.S. says.The program’s activities in Ukraine are similar to work the U.S. once conducted in Russia, specifically “collaborative biological research and biosafety and biosecurity upgrades at laboratories.” Russia eventually ended that cooperation.According to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, the program’s priorities in Ukraine “are to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern and to continue to ensure Ukraine can detect and report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats.” The program has worked. As Ling wrote for the Foreign Policy news site:“A 2007 review of the agency’s work by the National Research Council endorsed the program and found that ‘the national security payoffs from a robust and far-reaching program in this field are considerable.’ A 2019 fact sheet from the agency claims it destroyed some 4,700 tons of chemical weapons and facilitated the ‘construction or renovation of more than 100 laboratory and storage facilities’ as well as coordinated ‘more than 300 cooperative research projects aimed at safely studying, detecting, and diagnosing especially dangerous pathogens.’”Apart from the U.S., the labs involved have also received funding from the European Union and World Health Organization. Regarding the consultative meeting requested by Russia, the United Kingdom published a toughly worded statement on September 7 concerning Russia’s “unfounded allegations against the U.S. and Ukraine.”That statement read, in part:“[R]ussia has asked that we take their allegations seriously. It is hard to do so, when their presentation yesterday, delivered by a parade of nameless individuals, contains no more than misrepresentations of assorted public documents quoted incorrectly or out of context, and copy-pasted images from Wikipedia. This is not only an abuse of the time and resources States Parties have devoted to this meeting, in respect for the provisions of the Convention. It is a dangerous attempt to exploit the Convention for aggressive political purposes.”A look back shows this propaganda line by the Kremlin is decades old.The United States shut down its bioweapons research program in the 1960s. The Soviets did not. Yet the Soviet Union spread disinformation for decades that it was the United States developing biological weapons.That disinformation campaign saw a brief pause in 1988, was revived in 1995, and continued under Russian President Vladimir Putin. The outbreak of COVID-19 prompted renewed amplification of bioweapons disinformation targeting the United States.As previously reported by Polygraph.info, “Stories about non-existent U.S.-run biolabs in Ukraine have been a staple of Russian disinformation since the conflict began after Moscow illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.”Patrushev has also targeted Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Armenia with false biolab claims, conflating disease surveillance and public health activities with nonexistent bioweapon programs.Russian officials have gone so far as to accuse the United States of training migratory birds to deliver bioweapons to Russia, and wildly claimed that Ukrainian soldiers have been turned into “cruel and deadly monsters” through the injection of a secret serum.Chinese state media have echoed Russia’s false bioweapons claims.";https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-presses-new-offensive-as-russian-troops-retreat-from-kharkiv-region-/6740250.html,https://meetings.unoda.org/meeting/bwc-fcm-2022/,https://russiaun.ru/en/news/unsc_130522,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114272,https://theintercept.com/2022/03/17/russia-ukraine-bioweapons-misinformation/,https://www.sibreal.org/a/eto-soznatelnaya-lozh-ekspert-o-sozdanii-biooruzhiya-v-ukraine/31746506.html,https://thebulletin.org/2022/07/russia-finds-another-stage-for-the-ukraine-biolabs-disinformation-show/,https://thebulletin.org/2022/07/russia-finds-another-stage-for-the-ukraine-biolabs-disinformation-show/,https://www.science.org/content/article/russians-must-know-it-s-lie-ukrainian-bat-research-spun-false-tale-bioweapons,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/10/bioweapons-ukraine-russia-disinformation/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-who-says-it-advised-ukraine-destroy-pathogens-health-labs-prevent-2022-03-11/,https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3057517/fact-sheet-on-wmd-threat-reduction-efforts-with-ukraine-russia-and-other-former/,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Response-of-the-United-States-to-Questions-Posed-by-the-Russian-Federation.pdf,https://ua.usembassy.gov/embassy/kyiv/sections-offices/defense-threat-reduction-office/biological-threat-reduction-program/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/10/bioweapons-ukraine-russia-disinformation/,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/biological-and-toxin-weapons-convention-article-5-formal-consultative-meeting-september-2022-uk-statement,https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/NonProliferationReview_False%20allegations%20of%20biological%20weapons%20use%20from%20Putin%20s%20Russia.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-phony-biolab-claims-newest-russian-disinfo-on-ukraine-/6743305.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-azerbaijan-russia/6743369.html,https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kbmgg/russia-ukraine-bioweapons-trained-birds,https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-lawmakers-tout-baseless-claims-ukrainian-super-soldiers-2022-7,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-russian-lies-us-bioweapons-ukraine/6743423.html;Russia Can’t Stop Lying About U.S. Bioweapon Labs in Ukraine;;;;;;

The Russian army abandoned tanks, trucks and ammunition, and hundreds of soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, according to a raft of news reports.Moreover, the additional loss of the city of Izium sharply reduced Russia's ability to achieve its stated goal in the Donbas, military analysts said.The Russian army occupied Izium, a key logistics hub in the east of the Kharkiv region, in early April, after a month’s siege. The railroad connecting Kharkiv with Donbas passes through the city, military analysts told the BBC, making Izium a crucial supply juncture.On September 6, Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, catching Russian forces by surprise. In the first 48 hours, Ukrainian troops advanced at least 12 miles into Russian-occupied territory and recaptured about 150 square miles. By September 8, Ukraine reported that more than 20 towns and villages in the Kharkiv region had been liberated. Two days later, the Ukrainian army had pushed up to 40 miles into Russian-occupied territory and liberated more than 1,000 square miles, Ukraine defense officials said.In five days, Ukraine regained more territory than Russian troops had seized in the previous four months. That is the biggest setback for Russia since March, when its forces around the capital Kyiv were pushed back to Russia and Belarus.According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in Washington, D.C., the rapid counteroffensive is a “major operational defeat” for Russia.“Russian forces are not conducting a controlled withdrawal and are hurriedly fleeing southeastern Kharkiv Oblast [province] to escape encirclement around Izium,” the ISW reported on September 10.Russia's retreat from Izium undermines its plans to control Donbas, which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces abutting Russian borders. Russia recognizes the areas as breakaway republics from Ukraine.“The loss of Izium dooms the initial Russian campaign plan for this phase of the war and ensures that Russian advances toward Bakhmut or around Donetsk City (of Donbas region) cannot be decisive (if they occur at all),” the ISW assessment wrote on September 11. The losses around Kharkiv infuriated pro-war hardliners in Russia.Igor Girkin (Strelkov), a former state security officer who once commanded pro-Russian forces in Donbas, acknowledged a stinging setback. “For our part, we can only talk about how to prevent the development of an operational defeat into a strategic one,” Girkin wrote on Telegram.Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin whose forces are participating in the war, said that Russia’s Defense Ministry made mistakes.Unless strategic changes are made, Kadyrov said, he would “have to contact the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the leadership of the country to explain to them the situation that really exists there on the ground.”Kremlin officials continued to insist the war is on plan and that there are no plans to mobilize more troops. But Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had ominous words for critics of the campaign.""As for other points of view, critical points of view, as long as they remain within the law, this is pluralism, but the line is very, very thin. One must be very careful here,"" Peskov told journalists on September 13.The military equipment, ammunition and even soldiers that Russia left behind contradict the Defense Ministry's claim that the evacuation was planned.Ukraine released photos and videos showing dozens of pieces military equipment fleeing Russian troops left behind. According to the open-source investigative web site Oryx, Russian military’s visually confirmed losses on September 11 totaled 102 items, including 24 tanks and 26 infantry fighting vehicles.Ninety-five pieces of equipment were captured, and only seven were destroyed by the Ukrainian army, Oryx said.In one of the liberated villages, Hrakove, a Reuters journalist witnessed signs of Russian troops fleeing in a hurry. “Boxes of ammunition were scattered along with rubbish at positions the Russians had abandoned in evident haste,” the Reuters journalist reported.Russian soldiers were left to find their own ways to escape, leaving weapons and even tanks, according to The Washington Post. “Russians fled any way they could on Friday, on stolen bicycles, disguised as locals, abandoned by their units,” the newspaper reported.  In June and July, several Russian officials had visited an occupied part of the Kharkiv region and said the captured territory would always be part of Russia.On June 18, a pro-Kremlin United Russia party official, Alexander Sidyakin, stated: “Soon, we will begin issuing passports. Russia is here for good!”On July 6, Andrey Turchak, a United Russia senator, said: “I never get tired of repeating: Russia is here forever – this is already an indisputable fact.”On July 27, the Russian-installed head of the occupation administration in the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev, said: “From those territories, settlements that are under our control, Russia will not leave; I can say for sure that we are here for a long time, even forever.”Ukraine authorities said their main task now is to hold the recaptured areas while maintaining momentum. Russian forces remain dug in throughout Donbas and southern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.“A counteroffensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it. …Of course, we have to be worried, this war has worried us for years,” Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the Financial Times.";https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-regrouping/russia-pulls-forces-back-from-key-supply-hubs-for-donbas-campaign-idUKKBN2QB09H,https://theins.ru/news/254930,https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid027ZHJdUekWSc9PRjHQC1mfL2oqBFZ9sne1npQbXhmULa3UL6H5jPQb48GKuen9WDdl,https://www.5.ua/ru/rehyoni/v-kharkovskoi-oblasty-vsu-vzialy-v-plen-podpolkovnyka-rossyiskoi-armyy-vydeo-286998.html,https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-61174340,https://deepstatemap.live/en#8.5/49.6884/36.2053,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia,https://www.unian.net/war/vsu-osvobodili-bolee-20-naselennyh-punktov-v-harkovskoy-oblasti-genshtab-11971512.html,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-10,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-10,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-11,https://t.me/strelkovii/3200,https://theins.ru/news/254920,https://t.me/zakharprilepin/14547,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-no-discussion-mobilisation-after-military-setbacks-ukraine-2022-09-13/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2022/sep/12/russian-military-equipment-abandoned-in-ukrainian-counteroffensive-in-pictures,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-war-abandoned-russian-equipment/32029623.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/10/world/europe/ukraine-offensive-izium-donbas.html,https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html,https://twitter.com/Rebel44CZ/status/1569079250246062080?s=20&t=zbfi-Y0_QUJcbAthgqtZ4g,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-troops-raise-flag-over-railway-hub-advance-threatens-turn-into-rout-2022-09-10/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/11/kharkiv-liberated-retreat-izyum-russia/,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-09-11/ukraine-kharkiv%C2%A0russian-retreat-7297297.html,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/09/12/from-here-for-good-to-an-operation-to-curtail,https://mobile.twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1568612729963028480,https://vk.com/wall-163061027_2412659,https://t.me/strelkovii/3216,https://ura.news/news/1052567637,https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/15318145,https://www.ft.com/content/84ff2893-9b20-40c8-b503-f8fd10c99eca?accessToken=zwAAAYPLxf4RkdOE_yiTmyBAyNO1A_j9EMmeygE.MEQCIDZ1GOO2A0rkNxwRbkWdSxHXBrs0eSbTd_bGM6-RZWB7AiBKhFngJGdMTvWKVAKzVAB5Culh3ZRvcVSFCcbSQYMyJQ&segmentId=5350a41c-d6b9-abb6-761c-bcaf0ad94329;False: Russia is Merely ‘Regrouping’ After its Rout in Kharkiv;;;;;;
44;;;;Misleading;Margarita Simonyan;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-kremlin-media-chiefs-misleading-boast-about-not-carpet-bombing-ukraine/6744566.html;Kremlin Media Chief’s Misleading Boast About Not ‘Carpet Bombing’ Ukraine;2022-09-12;polygraph;;On September 4, Russia’s top state media editor Margarita Simonyan said on TV that the Ukraine war could not end until that “lesser human” nation is “crushed to the end.”Ukrainian children should be given to good Russian families, she said, so they could be raised as “human beings.”Simonyan stated:“Thank God we are different … We do not allow ourselves to carpet bomb Ukrainian cities. Why? Because we couldn’t? We could have, easily. I am proud that we don’t allow ourselves that.”That is misleading. In fact, Russia has been widely accused of indiscriminate bombing, or deliberately hitting civilian targets.To cite the most recent example, Russian rockets hit the country’s second-biggest heat and power plant in Kharkiv on September 12, apparently in retaliation after Ukrainian forces recaptured the key city in a sweeping offensive operation.Indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets has arguably been a signature Russian tactic, one that Moscow used in its war on Chechnya in 1990s and early 2000s and the Syrian civil war. A United Nations team accused the Russian air force of war crimes in Syria.The term “carpet bombing” dates back to the Second World War practice of “saturation bombing,” or dropping massive quantities of ordnance across a wide area to cause overwhelming devastation and terror.Whether the term fits Russia’s combination of bombing, artillery fire and rocket attacks in Ukraine is debatable. But there’s no disputing that Russia has inflicted widespread damage on residences, medical facilities, schools and other civilian infrastructure, killing and wounding thousands of noncombatants.“Russian bombers just carpet-bombed Mariupol,” Forbes reported on April 15.Russian jets dropped unguided bombs on the besieged city, where more than 160,000 civilians were trapped in dire conditions, Forbes said. A single bomb attack on a Mariupol theater being used a shelter is believed to have killed 600 people.The U.K.’s Guardian newspaper reported that satellite images showed “devastated residential building, blasted park lands and smoldering grocery stores.” The photos showed blocks-long swaths of burned-out buildings and homes.The International Red Cross called conditions in Mariupol “apocalyptic.” Ukrainian officials claimed that Russian bombing had destroyed 95% of the city, still under Russian control, and estimated that about 22,000 civilians were killed.The United Nations said 90% of Mariupol’s residential buildings were destroyed or damaged and that it had confirmed 1,348 civilian deaths, a toll likely to be thousands short of the actual one.Russian bombs obliterated the southern town of Popasna to such a degree that Russian occupation authorities decided not to rebuild. Videos from Russian drones showed troops rounding up prisoners amid battered homes, shredded trees and debris from explosions that looked like the aftermath of a tornado.In April, Russia used ballistic missiles to strike the main train station in Kramatorsk, where more than 4,000 civilians were awaiting evacuation to safety. More than 50 people were killed and nearly 100 injured in that attack.The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in April that Russia had used cluster bombs “to kill as many civilians as possible and to sow panic and fear,” The Guardian reported.The Cluster Munition Coalition, a civil society watchdog group and Human Rights Watch have accused both Russia and Ukraine of using cluster bombs, which release scores of bomblets across a wide area, each capable killing or maiming if triggered. (Both Ukraine and Russia deny using cluster bombs.)Western warfare experts compare Russia’s bombing of Ukraine with tactics during the two wars in Chechnya and Syria.Here’s how The National Interest described the battle for the Chechen capital Grozny in 1994:“… [T]he most intense bombing campaign in Europe since 1945. Not known for their precision, BM-27 Uragan and BM-21 Grad rocket launchers failed to effectively neutralize Chechen combatants--they did, however, level large swathes of the city while killing thousands of civilians. Russian troops finally took Grozny on the heels of around 25,000-35,000 civilian casualties…”Analysts at the U.S. think-tank RAND Corp. said in a March 28 commentary that Russia did the same in Aleppo in 2015 on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad:“Following the play book in Chechnya, Russia used TU-22M Backfire medium bombers to conduct ‘carpet bombing’ of Aleppo. Salafi jihadist and other anti-Assad rebels had no air defenses. Even though such bombardment may be an international war crime, it helped quell the anti-Assad insurgency. Over one million Syrians were driven north into eastern Turkey. From there many moved en masse to Europe, helping to destabilize the political equilibrium of some European states, including Hungary and Germany. Moscow scored a geostrategic win.”;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-kharkiv-77988f0d236f26025159709918f78181,https://www.britannica.com/topic/carpet-bombing,https://www.dw.com/en/has-russias-carpet-bombing-of-ukraine-been-halted/a-62732182,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61036740,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-evacuations-03-09-intl/index.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/mariupol-bombing-ukraine-before-and-after-satellite-images-map-russian-attack-residential-maternity-childrens-hospital,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/04/15/russian-bombers-just-carpet-bombed-mariupol/?sh=b49ea1d7b28b,https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1#:~:text=Mariupol%20has%20taken%20on%20outsize,died%20during%20the%20Russian%20siege.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/mariupol-bombing-ukraine-before-and-after-satellite-images-map-russian-attack-residential-maternity-childrens-hospital,https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-apocalyptic-conditions-of-ukraine-s-mariupol-134939205939,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3516003-over-100-bodies-of-those-killed-by-russian-bombardment-found-under-rubble-in-mariupol.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/20/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-bombing-mariupol-school-sheltering-400,https://www.reuters.com/world/residents-captured-ukrainian-port-city-try-survive-among-its-ruins-2022-07-21/,https://youtu.be/883Ye8lHuLE,https://meduza.io/en/news/2022/08/09/occupation-authorities-likely-won-t-rebuild-popasna,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/europe/ukraine-drone-footage-popasna-intl/index.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/world/europe/ukraine-train-station-attack.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/kramatorsk-train-station-ukraine-russia-rockets,http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/cluster-bombs/what-is-a-cluster-bomb.aspx,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/world/europe/cluster-munitions-russia-ukraine.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/russia-ukraine-bombardment-chechnya.html,https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/03/russia-destroyed-grozny-and-aleppo-is-kyiv-next.html;Kremlin Media Chief’s Misleading Boast About Not ‘Carpet Bombing’ Ukraine;;;;;;

The firm’s revelations about malicious activities linked to the South China Sea add to a growing body of evidence pointing to Beijing.Chinese tourists take souvenir photos with the Chinese national flag as they visit Quanfu Island, one of Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, on September 14, 2014. (Associated Press)Proofpoint did not come to its conclusions alone. It collaborated with the PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Threat Intelligence team to examine what the two called a multi-phase, sustained phishing campaign. And they attributed the campaign to a “China-based, espionage motivated threat actor.”“Our Threat Insight team conducts research into the most pertinent cyber threats facing society today to keep our customers and the wider community safe. To do so, the findings are subjected to rigorous scrutiny to ensure accuracy and objectivity,” Sherrod DeGrippo, Vice President of Threat Research and Detection at Proofpoint, said in a statement.“We often publish these findings with the purpose of keeping the global cybersecurity community informed of the threats facing organizations around the world, thus contributing to a more secure overall landscape. We of course stand by the findings published this week and will continue to provide thorough and reliable research on breaking cyber threats.”The China-based hackers, identified as Red Ladon or TA423, have been active since 2013, “targeting a variety of organizations in response to political events in the Asia-Pacific region,” Proofpoint said.The latest phase of the cyber-espionage campaign, active from April through June 2022, spanned Australia, Malaysia, Europe and entities operating in the South China Sea.TA423 engaged in a phishing scam by posing as the employee of a made-up news website called the Australian Morning News, which copied content from legitimate news publications.Target computers were infected with malware when clinking on links to the site.Proofpoint said the hackers sought to infiltrate Australian military academic institutions, local and federal government entities and the public health sector.Canberra previously accused China of directing cyberattacks against Australian government and corporate interests in response to its decision to ban the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's involvement in developing Australia’s 5G network.Australia has expressed concerns over Huawei's close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, although Beijing denies the company is controlled by the state.In Malaysia, the hackers targeted offshore drilling and deep-water energy exploration entities, specifically those involved with the Kasawari Gas Project off the coast of Malaysia in the South China Sea, which China’s Coast Guard contests.Malaysian financial and global marketing companies, and entities directly involved in an offshore wind farm in the Taiwan Strait, also were in the crosshairs, Proofpoint saidThe hackers targeted several multinational firms related to the “global supply chains of offshore energy projects in the South China Sea.”The hackers also sought to penetrate Cambodia's National Election Commission prior to that country’s 2018 elections.A woman shows her stained finger at a polling station during a general election in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on July 29, 2018. (Samrang Pring/Reuters)“Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the campaigns were conducted by the China-based, espionage-motivated threat actor TA423, which PwC tracks as Red Ladon and which also overlaps with ‘Leviathan,' ‘GADOLINIUM,’ and ‘APT40,’” the cybersecurity firm said.Proofpoint noted “the content of the emails and the malicious URL technique” mirrored those previously used by threat actor TA423.Specifically, between April and September 2021, Proofpoint documented a novel method used for malicious phishing — Rich Text Format injection — employed by TA423 to target entities in Malaysia and other firms working in the energy exploration sector.Proofpoint breaks down how Rich Text Format injection works here.TA423 used those same techniques in its latest cyber-espionage campaign, the company said.Proofpoint noted that TA423 had already been named in a 2021 U.S. Department of Justice indictment, which named the operation as providing “long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security.”Hainan is China’s southernmost province and consists of islands in the South China Sea.“One of TA423’s longest running areas of responsibility is assessed to include the South China Sea, with the U.S. Department of Justice indictment indicating that the threat actor has historically focused on intellectual property related to naval technology developed by federally funded defense contractors globally,” Proofpoint said.The cybersecurity firm Mandiant also found that advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT40 (a.k.a. TA423) engages “in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence targets, especially organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or involved in South China Sea disputes.”“We assess with moderate confidence that APT40 is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage operation. The actor’s targeting is consistent with Chinese state interests and there are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in China,” Mandiant said.The United States and other Western states accused China of carrying out the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server cyberattacks.In its 2021 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, Microsoft said the U.S. government and its allies had attributed, “with a high level of confidence,” the attacks targeting Microsoft ""to cyber actors affiliated with China’s civilian intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security.”A man walks by the Microsoft office in Beijing on August 7, 2020. (Associated Press)The U.S. Justice Department charged four members of APT40 for conducting a global computer intrusion campaign that targeted dozens of companies, universities and government entities between 2011 and 2018.The department said the four individuals were Chinese nationals working with China’s Ministry of State Security.The British government also concluded that the Chinese Ministry of State Security was behind APT40.In February, China was linked to a hacking campaign targeting News Corp outlets, including The Wall Street Journal.Mandiant said the threat actors had “a China nexus,” adding “they are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China’s interests.""In its 2021 Global Threat Report, the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that Chinese adversaries are “one of the most prolific state-sponsored cyber actors on the planet.”";https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-cyber/australia-sees-china-as-main-suspect-in-state-based-cyberattacks-sources-say-idUSKBN23P3T5,https://apnews.com/article/technology-china-sydney-australia-037521cd9d6e09854c98b4acf1acbf20,https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/why-did-australia-block-huawei-zte-from-5g-roll-out/,https://amti.csis.org/contest-at-kasawari-another-malaysian-gas-project-faces-pressure/,https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/injection-new-black-novel-rtf-template-inject-technique-poised-widespread,https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-hack-microsoft-exchange/31370667.html,https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-a-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-news-corp-hack-china/31694965.html,https://go.crowdstrike.com/crowdstrike-global-threat-report-2021.html?utm_campaign=brand&utm_content=us&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=goog&utm_term=crowdstrike%20overwatch&gclid=CjwKCAjwi9-HBhACEiwAPzUhHJsp1DGRmwQpjikb85ViKbXCezVD9H-d4XFWgfLv89dB8lOArT6MYRoCx4wQAvD_BwE;Evidence Backs Up Beijing Link to South China Sea Hackers;;;;;;

Support for Ukraine;2022-08-30;polygraph;;"On August 26, the Russian Embassy in Turkey claimed that international support for Ukraine at the United Nations has declined since Russian forces attacked on February 24.The claim, in an embassy tweet, followed a U.N. Security Council meeting on the six-month anniversary of the invasion.The tweet read:“On March 2, 2022, 141 countries voted in favor of the UN's draft resolution on Ukraine. Kiev's anti-Russian statement at the UN on August 25, 2022, was supported by only 54 out of 193 states.”That’s false.First, back on March 2, 141 states among the 193-member U.N. General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine.Fast forward to August 24. During the Security Council meeting that day, 57 U.N. member states plus the European Union issued a joint statement condemning Russia again on the six-month anniversary of its invasion.That joint statement reiterated the March 2 resolution’s demand that Russia cease hostilities and withdraw its troops.For reasons unknown, the Russian embassy’s tweet referred to Ukraine’s “anti-Russian statement at the UN on August 25.”But there was no U.N. meeting about Ukraine on August 25, and the joint statement was supported not by 54 states, but 57 states plus the European Union.During the August 24 meeting, Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Valsily Nebenzya, seemingly contradicting the view of the Russian Embassy in Turkey, referred to the “unfailing support of Western delegations for any actions of the Kyiv regime.”That sounds more like solidarity than an erosion of support. Given the ever-rising volume of Western arms and other aid flowing to Ukraine, Nebenzya appears to have it right.What else happened at the U.N. on August 24?Russia lost a vote to prevent Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from delivering a video speech to the Security Council. Of the council’s 15 member states, 13 voted in favor of Zelenskyy’s address, while China abstained.Only Russia voted against the speech.“In order to build the future, it is necessary to leave in the trash box of history what has always prevented humanity from living in peace, namely aggression and colonial ambitions. That is, what Russia came to Ukraine with,” Zelenskyy told the Security Council. ""Our independence is your security.""Here is another way to measure support for Ukraine.In March 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in embrace of Ukraine’s territorial integrity by 100 to 11, with 58 member states abstaining and 24 not voting.By comparison, that March 2022 vote condemning the new invasion passed 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions and 12 not voting.That’s a 41 percent increase in U.N. members voting for Ukraine’s independence – and yes, against Russia.";https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125342,https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/unga-resolution-against-ukraine-invasion-full-text,https://usun.usmission.gov/joint-statement-on-six-months-of-russias-full-scale-invasion-of-ukraine/,https://usun.usmission.gov/joint-statement-on-six-months-of-russias-full-scale-invasion-of-ukraine/,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125342,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-western-nations-1-5-billion/31984019.html,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-votes-against-zelenskyy-addressing-083100857.html,https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-maye-buti-prityagnuta-do-vidpovidalnosti-za-zlochin-a-77301,https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/767565?ln=en,https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3959039?ln=en;Russian Embassy in Turkey Fabricates Waning U.N.

This is provocation aimed at ‘freedom of trespassing’ and it constitutes deliberate sabotage of regional peace and stability.”Zhao’s accusation of trespassing is false.Although China blames the U.S. for sabotaging “regional peace and security,” the record shows that it is Beijing that repeatedly threatens its neighbors through sweeping claims of sovereignty over the sea, along with other aggressive actions.A People's Liberation Army soldier looks through binoculars during military exercises as Taiwan’s frigate Lan Yang is seen in the rear on August 5, 2022. (Lin Jian/Xinhua via AP)The 7th Fleet said that the freedom of navigation operation was done “in accordance with international law,” noting the ships “transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state.”It added that the United States Navy would continue operating “anywhere international law allows.”Such freedom of navigation operations did not come out of the blue.China attempts to control what vessels can operate where in the region, imposing the so-called “nine-dash line,” an arbitrary boundary that Beijing claims gives it control over most of the South China Sea.But the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) clearly outlines the territorial waters of coastal states (like China) and archipelagic states or island nations (like Indonesia and the Philippines).The territorial waters of China extend 12 nautical miles from its low-water mark or baseline.Moreover, Article 19 of UNCLOS, which concerns innocent passage, allows foreign ships, even military vessels, to pass through the territorial waters of another state so long as that passage is “not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.”Coastal states cannot claim territorial waters around submerged features and low-tide elevations (that is, a naturally formed area of land submerged during high tide) which fall outside of their territorial waters.China, however, did just that in 2009, imperiously claiming it had “indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof.”In 2016, following a challenge by the Philippines, the Arbitral Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague rebuked China’s sweeping claim.China has ignored that ruling as it intensifies efforts to control most of the South China Sea, while bullying neighboring countries that attempt to assert their rights.As for “trespassing,” China has repeatedly launched incursions into its neighbors’ back yards by claiming territories that fall within the countries’ 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ)s.Some countries, like Malaysia, have attempted to engage in “quiet diplomacy” over China’s claims, although a June 2021 flight by 16 Chinese warplanes over Sarawak, a Malaysian state on the island of Borneo, prompted protest.Indonesia has also faced Chinese encroachment in what it calls the North Natuna Sea, which falls in Indonesia’s EEZ in the southern portion of the South China Sea.Beni Sukadis, a national security analyst at Indonesia’s Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, said the Malaysian and Indonesian navies respond to incursions by Chinese Coast Guard vessels by “shadowing” them “rather than confronting them and forcing them to leave.”That practice, he said, reflected their risk calculus “regarding Beijing’s assertiveness.”Indonesia has tried not to upset the apple cart with China, and is officially a non-claimant state in the South China Sea.But earlier this month, more than 5,000 soldiers from the U.S., Indonesia, Australia, Japan and Singapore took part in joint combat exercises on Indonesia’s Sumatra island.Elsewhere in the region, China has repeatedly sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the Paracel Islands, and reportedly used the threat of force to halt Vietnamese drilling projects that fall within the nine-dash line.The Philippines has lodged more than 300 diplomatic protests against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea.Protesters against China's actions at the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea march towards the Chinese consulate in Manila, Philippines, on May 11, 2012. (Erik De Castro/Reuters)In November 2021, China’s Coast Guard blocked and used water cannons against Philippine resupply ships headed to the Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, a submerged reef in the contested Spratly Islands that falls within the Philippines’ EEZ.On June 9, the Philippines “protested the return of over 100 Chinese vessels illegally operating in the waters in and around Julian Felipe (Whitsun) Reef,” which also falls within the country’s EEZ.That incident occurred roughly one year after more than 200 Chinese ships “swarmed” the area, igniting tensions.While the Philippines has also sought to avoid going to war with China over the South China Sea, earlier this year the United States and Philippines carried out their largest-ever joint military drills in the shadow of China-Taiwan tensions.In March, a top U.S. Navy commander said China had militarized at least three islands in the South China Sea, equipping them with “anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment, and fighter jets,” The Associated Press reported.That, the commander said, constitutes China’s “largest military buildup since World War II.”The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative says China has established 20 outposts on island groups in the region. The initiative is a project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank.;https://www.c7f.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/3142171/7th-fleet-cruisers-transit-taiwan-strait/,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2009re_mys_vnm_e.pdf,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57328868,https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2021/06/695298/sabah-govt-condemns-chinese-military-jet-intrusion,https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/china-indonesia-and-malaysia-waltzing-around-oil-rigs/,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2022/08/12/us-indonesia-australia-hold-military-drills-amid-china-concerns/,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-chinese-vessel-rams-vietnamese-fishing-boat-in-s-china-sea,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1526701/vietnam-airs-video-chinese-ship-sinking-fishing-boat-south-china-sea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/vietnam-halts-south-china-sea-oil-drilling-project-under-pressure-from-beijing-idUSKBN1GZ0JN,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-protests-chinas-illegal-acts-disputed-south-china-sea-atoll-2022-06-11/,https://amti.csis.org/the-second-thomas-shoal-incident-and-the-reset-in-philippine-u-s-ties/,https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-protests-china-return-julian-felipe-reef-june-2022/,https://www.gmfus.org/news/chinas-relations-philippines-under-ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr,https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/4/1/Balikatan-held-facing-China--Taiwan.html,https://apnews.com/article/business-china-beijing-xi-jinping-south-china-sea-d229070bc2373be1ca515390960a6e6c,https://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/china/;Beijing Bullies its South China Sea Neighbors, Then Falsely Accuses U.S. of ‘Trespassing’;;;;;;

At the same time, every effort is being done to prevent civilian casualties.”That is false based on accounts from numerous witnesses, reports by international observers and independent media reports that give evidence of egregious violations of the law of war.In times of war, international humanitarian law seeks to protect civilians, medical and aid workers, the wounded, the sick and prisoners of war (POWs). To name just two examples from the law, it is forbidden to torture prisoners and deliberately kill civilians.The Geneva Convention of 1949 and its additional protocols, ratified by almost all countries, including Russia, comprise most of the international humanitarian laws. The most severe violations of the conventions are referred to as war crimes. Does Russia abide?Russian forces have been destroying civilian structures throughout Ukraine. Russian bombs, rockets and artillery have killed thousands of noncombatants since invading in late February.On February 25, Amnesty International took issue with Moscow’s claim that its forces were using only precision-guided weapons.“The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas. Some of these attacks may be war crimes,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general.According to the United Nations, at least 102 civilians, including seven children, were killed in the first five days of the war. “Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on February 28. During the first month of the war, Russia tried to seize Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, bombing and rocketing residential areas and injuring and killing civilians.Borodianka, a small town in the Bucha district 50 kilometers northwest of the capital, was on the main line of the Russian advance. On March 1, Russian aviation and artillery delivered a devastating attack on it, which only eight of the town’s 29 high-rise buildings survived. There was not a single military facility in the town.According to news reports, Anatoly Rudnichenko, an adviser to Borodianka's mayor, estimated that about 200 people, mostly civilians, died in the bombardment.Other Bucha district towns and villages also came under fire. The village of Vablya near Borodianka was nearly razed. In Andreevka, Russian troops are alleged to have shot many men and raped several girls. One father who tried to protect his daughter was brutally killed. The city of Bucha, which is the district’s administrative center, was the site of the most notorious war crimes allegation – a massacre.Photo and video evidence emerged on April 1, after Russian forces were pushed back from areas around Kyiv. According to Bucha’s mayor and other local officials, 1,316 bodies were eventually found on its streets, in mass graves in nearby forests and elsewhere.Around 650 civilians were shot in what a senior police official described as executions, the BBC reported. Moscow claimed that the West and Ukraine staged all the killings. (The Kremlin continues to maintain that reports of war crimes in Bucha are fake or “false flag” operations.)At least 52 people were killed, and about 100 others were injured in a rocket attack on a railway station in the city of Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, on April 8. The attack occurred as some 4,000 people, including many women, children and elderly people, were at the station trying to flee the city.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the strike – and others targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure – constituted “gross violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, for which the perpetrators must be held accountable.” On April 13, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) released a report on Russia’s attack on Ukraine focusing on incidents that took place from February 24 to April 1. According to the OSCE, Russia struck civilian targets with missiles and bombs, violating international humanitarian law and committing war crimes.On June 27, a Russian missile hit a busy shopping mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the missile “caused devastating loss of civilian life.”“The incident should be investigated as a potential war crime,” said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at HRW.A U.N. human rights report released on June 29 stated that many means and methods of the Russian-Ukrainian war violate international humanitarian law. While attributing most of the violations to Russia forces, the investigators did not absolve Ukraine.“While on a much lower scale, it also appears likely that Ukrainian armed forces did not fully comply with [humanitarian law] in eastern parts of the country,” the report said.A residential building in the Donetsk region town of Chasiv Yar was shelled on July 9, killing at least 48 people. According to the head of the Donetsk region, the Russian military fired four rockets from a Uragan multiple rocket launcher.“The attack in Chasiv Yar killing 34+ innocent people shows the brutal truth behind its campaign of lies,” the British Ministry of Defense wrote on July 12. (At that time, there were 34 confirmed victims of the strike.) On the morning of July 14, Russian forces launched a missile strike on the crowded center of the city of Vinnytsia. The strike killed at least 27 civilians, including three children.A second OSCE report, published on July 14, confirmed that Russian attacks had killed many civilians, and damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure in many Ukrainian cities and villages, including houses, hospitals, cultural heritage sites, schools, high-rise residential buildings and administrative buildings.The report also documented evidence that Ukrainian civilians had been forcibly transferred to Russia, as well as evidence of rapes, torture, executions and looting perpetrated by Russian military personnel.According to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), between February 24, the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and August 21, there were 13,477 civilian casualties in Ukraine – 5,587 killed and 7,890 injured.“Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles, and air strikes,” the report stated.Ukraine has begun prosecuting Russian POWs accused of war crimes. Meantime, Russian occupation officials in the Donetsk province plan to prosecute members of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment captured in the fall of Mariupol. On August 10, Reuters reported:“Though the Azov prisoners have not yet been formally charged, on Aug. 2 Russia's supreme court ruled the regiment was a terrorist organization, clearing the way for captured fighters to be charged as such.“Ukraine, which has itself tried and convicted a string of Russian soldiers for war crimes committed against civilians, says the Azov captives are prisoners of war, deserving of protection under the Geneva Conventions.“‘The first tribunal will take place probably in Mariupol, and it will be organized before the end of summer,’ ”Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters during a tour organized by Russia's defense ministry.""Handling the thousands of accusations against Russian forces would likely overwhelm Ukraine’s justice system. An August 12 analysis by journalist Justin Ling in Foreign Policy reported:“Ukraine has already begun laying charges against captured Russian soldiers: Its first conviction, of a tank unit sergeant who executed an unarmed civilian, resulted in a conviction in May. That case was relatively straightforward: The sergeant admitted to shooting the Ukrainian man but said he was merely following orders. (This so-called Nuremberg defense is generally not accepted under international law.)“Ukraine’s legal system simply does not have the capacity to handle the sheer volume of cases that are expected: Then-Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told the BBC last month they have received reports of some 21,000 war crimes. Even a peacetime Ukraine would be stretched beyond capacity.“They are not entirely alone. The International Criminal Court has established a full investigative team in Ukraine and is actively collecting evidence for possible prosecutions. Kyiv has launched proceedings at the International Court of Justice, accusing Russia of genocide. Another case, albeit largely symbolic, was launched at the European Court of Human Rights. Ukraine’s allies, including the United States and European Union, have offered support for these war crimes investigations.""";https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defence-minister-shoigu-military-campaign-ukraine-deliberately-slowed-2022-08-24/,https://tass.com/politics/1497555,https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/what_is_ihl.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-warcrimes-convention/russias-putin-revokes-geneva-convention-protocol-on-war-crimes-victims-idUSKBN1WW2IN,https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm,https://ru.interfax.com.ua/news/general/801337.html,https://t.me/uniannet/31085,https://zona.media/online/2022/02/24/war-in-ua,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/russian-military-commits-indiscriminate-attacks-during-the-invasion-of-ukraine/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/russian-military-commits-indiscriminate-attacks-during-the-invasion-of-ukraine/,https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/02/bachelet-calls-strong-leadership-moment-profound-gravity,https://kyiv.tsn.ua/ru/v-kieve-rossiyskaya-raketa-popala-v-mnogoetazhku-foto-i-video-1989034.html,https://kyiv.tsn.ua/pislya-peregovoriv-rosiya-zapustila-po-kiyevu-balistichni-raketi-video-1992259.html,https://kyiv.tsn.ua/yak-viglyadaye-kiyivska-bagatoperhivka-pislya-nichnogo-raketnogo-obstrilu-foto-video-1987771.html,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war#videos-show-devastated-apartment-buildings-in-a-town-just-northwest-of-kyiv,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-borodyanka-destruction-russian-attack-drone-footage/31734904.html,https://www.bbc.com/russian/media-60581720,https://ru.euronews.com/2022/04/21/borodyanka-exhumations-report,https://www.pap.pl/ru/news%2C1148915%2Cvlasti-ukrainy-chislo-pogibshikh-mirnykh-zhiteley-v-borodyanke-mozhet-byt-bolshe,https://www.stopcor.org/section-suspilstvo/news-misto-yakogo-nemae-yak-borodyanka-perezhila-rosijsku-okupatsiyu-video-26-04-2022.html,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/04/04/russias-bucha-facts-versus-the-evidence/,https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220817-bucha-massacre-ukrainians-continue-to-bury-unidentified-bodies,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-criminal-investigations-bed8a5fac1dab4cfcdf45aed815ff510,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61442387,https://tass.com/world/1432013,https://www.polygraph.info/a/after-deadly-car-blast-russian-embassy-puts-u-s-denunciation-in-false-light/32006141.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-media-campaign-falsely-claims-bucha-deaths-are-fakes-/6517486.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-rockets-kramatorsk-train-station/31792658.html,https://www.currenttime.tv/a/31793386.html,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115842,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-04-08/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-ukraine,https://www.osce.org/permanent-council/515874,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/a/515868.pdf,https://www.forbes.com/sites/madelinehalpert/2022/04/13/russia-committed-clear-violations-of-humanitarian-law-and-war-crimes-osce-says/?sh=776670f1686a,https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-61957087,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/30/ukraine-russian-missile-kills-civilians-shopping-center,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/30/ukraine-russian-missile-kills-civilians-shopping-center,https://ukraine.un.org/en/188268-new-report-un-human-rights-shows-shocking-toll-war-ukraine,https://ukraine.un.org/en/188268-new-report-un-human-rights-shows-shocking-toll-war-ukraine,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/10/europe/ukraine-russia-donetsk-attack-intl/index.html,https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/zavalami-chasovom-ru-nashli-eshche-odnogo-1657733024.html,https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1546796884924268544,https://zona.media/chronicle/146#49103,https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/live/62300872?pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:993e4812-7a36-448d-bdd1-d86dd33a5b6e,https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1547647031124013062?s=20&t=7CPgkNuNOdvIKLO0Q9QwUw,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/3/e/522616.pdf,https://www.state.gov/osce-releases-the-second-expert-mission-report-on-human-rights-abuses-and-international-humanitarian-law-violations-in-russias-war-against-ukraine/,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/08/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-22-august-2022,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/08/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-22-august-2022,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/08/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-22-august-2022,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-donetsk-trial-idCAKBN2PH03P,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/08/12/how-to-prosecute-russias-war-crimes/;War Crimes and the Russian Defense Minister’s Fantasy World;;;;;;

Her accompanying message:“The history of American aggression in a snapshot! And this does not even include proxy wars, regime changes and other acts that destabilize regions, nations and peoples.”“Begs the question: will a nation that romances war ever know peace? Or allow for it? #US #war.”Screen shot of a deleted tweet from Meifang Zhang, Consul General of China in Belfast, posted on August 23, 2022. The tweet accused the United States of being the aggressor in a number of conflicts, including during WWII against Imperial Japan.Problem is, Zhang lists the United States as aggressor in wars it clearly did not start. (Forget that the country didn’t exist when colonies rose up against Britain.)Most notably (and bafflingly), Zhang accused the United States of being the aggressor in World War II against Imperial Japan.Imperial Japan, of course, had launched a war of aggression against China years before the United States entered the war. The United States only declared war on Japan after the December 7, 1941, surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, in which more than 2,400 Americans died.Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the United States into an alliance with China. The United States had provided China military aid prior to Pearl Harbor and established the American Military Mission to China in July 1941 to provide aid and advice.One week prior to Zhang’s tweet, China marked the 77th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, in which Chinese state media urged Japan to “face up to the historical facts of its aggression.”Zhang also accused the United States of being the aggressor against Germany in World War I.Although the causes of World War I are complex and numerous, the United States was not an instigator. When war broke out in July 1914, the United States, pursuing a policy of neutrality, sat on the sidelines for nearly three years.The U.S. decision to finally declare war on Germany in April 1917 came after repeated German submarine attacks on passenger and merchant ships.Likewise, while Zhang called the United States the aggressor in the Korean War, that conflict, as Polygraph.info previously reported, started when Soviet-backed North Korea launched a full-scale invasion of the south on June 25, 1950. Roughly 75,000 North Korean People’s Army soldiers marched across the 38th parallel boundary that divided the Koreas.The day Pyongyang launched its attack, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 82, calling on North Korea to cease hostilities and withdraw. North Korea ignored that, prompting the council to pass resolutions asking U.N. members to help “repel the attack and restore peace.”As for the American Civil War, the separatist, pro-slavery Confederate States of America launched the first attack by firing on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in April 1861.Zhang’s tweet remained online for roughly two days before being deleted. Polygraph.info reached out to the China’s Consulate General in Belfast to ask why the tweet had been deleted but had not heard back at the time of publication.Zhang’s tweet fits into a broader pattern of so-called “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, in which Chinese diplomats use social media to aggressively counter criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and spread anti-Western disinformation.False or misleading information about COVID-19, Russia’s war in Ukraine and the treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in China’s northwestern Xinjiang province, along with general anti-American sentiment, are regular talking points for Chinese diplomats on Twitter.Those attacks are often delivered as crudely conceived memes.For example, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhou tweeted a photo montage insinuating that the United States carried out the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center.Zhou has previously spread the repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory that the United States Army may have introduced COVID-19 to China.On August 25, Zhang shared a cartoon of a monster with Monkeypox written on its arm. The monster is punching through a brick wall with a cross on top, grabbing Uncle Sam. The message behind the image is unclear.One Twitter user commented: “Didn’t know the sole task of a Chinese consul general was to spread anti western propaganda all day every day.”Zhang has tweeted nearly 28,000 times since joining Twitter in January 2020, very rarely about Northern Irish affairs.The Associated Press reported in May 2021 that “China’s rise on Twitter has been powered by an army of fake accounts that have retweeted Chinese diplomats and state media tens of thousands of times, covertly amplifying propaganda that can reach hundreds of millions of people.”In 2019, Twitter suspended 200,000 accounts that were part of a Chinese-state-backed disinformation operation. Twitter routinely removes or suspends networks of accounts spreading Chinese propaganda.Large networks of Chinese propaganda accounts continue to be discovered and suspended.;https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/presidential-inquiries/invasion-manchuria,https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/pearl-harbor-fact-sheet-1.pdf,https://history.army.mil/html/books/009/9-1/CMH_Pub_9-1.pdf,https://english.news.cn/20220816/c97e3d84e3a04cffa359f61d113ab982/c.html,https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-forgets-who-was-the-real-aggressor-in-korean-war/31969421.html,https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Civil_War_Begins.htm,https://www.nbr.org/publication/understanding-chinese-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3085856/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-defends-wolf-warrior,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-04/wolf-warrior-diplomats-defend-china-handling-coronavirus,https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1496755609886019586,https://www.axios.com/2022/08/24/china-xinjiang-uyhgur-disinformation-campaign,https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823,https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-china-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-62b13895aa6665ae4d887dcc8d196dfc,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/18/world/asia/hk-twitter.html,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/12/twitter-deletes-170000-accounts-linked-to-china-influence-campaign,https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815606/twitter-china-misinformation-campaign-uyghur-muslims-xinjiang-propaganda,https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-beijing-race-and-ethnicity-14fec4421be0291e5f0ea580ecbd4b6d,https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-suspends-hundreds-of-bots-posting-chinese-olympic-propaganda-2022-2?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds;Chinese Diplomat Flunks History, Calls U.S. the WWII Aggressor Against Japan;;;;;;

He also said that surveys by foreign chambers of commerce and foreign media reports showed that China had become “a promising land for investment in recent years.”“All this shows that the vast majority of foreign businesses remain fully confident in the Chinese market,” he claimed, adding that “measures being put in place to ensure safety against COVID and promote socio-economic development” would further boost the Chinese market’s prospects.That is misleading.While it is true that foreign investment into China in 2022 has increased year over year, and that a majority of foreign businesses have not exited China, foreign companies are far from “optimistic” or “fully confident” about doing business there.China’s draconian policy of zero-COVID lockdowns, staunchly championed by the country’s president, Xi Jinping, is among the main causes of concern within the foreign business community.A flash survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in China over April 29-May 5 found that the American business community’s “confidence in doing business in China continues to decrease.”More than half (52%) of the survey’s respondents indicated they had “already either delayed or decreased investments as a result of the recent COVID-19 outbreak,” while 58% indicated they had decreased their 2022 revenue projections.While much of the world has moved beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and eased restrictions on businesses and daily lives, China has maintained a stringent zero-COVID policy that has restricted the number of flights into the country and imposed sweeping lockdowns in major financial and economic hubs, shuttering factories and businesses.“The COVID lockdowns this year and the restrictions over the past two years are going to mean that three, four, five years from now, we will most likely see investment decline,” AmCham China President Michael Hart said during a May press conference in Beijing to launch the chamber's annual report.Hart also said COVID restrictions were “leading foreign companies with supply chains in China to look for alternative sources to reduce disruption,” Reuters reported. “While this doesn’t mean an immediate shift outside of China, Hart said that many firms that source from China are asking where else they can get supplies, and whether they should be building or sourcing from somewhere else,” Bloomberg News reported.The AmCham survey found that China’s zero-COVID policies had led 49% of the respondents to say that “foreign talent is either significantly less likely or refusing to relocate to China.”“China usually ranks among the top three destinations for investment among AmCham’s member companies, but ‘it is falling in preference,’ Bloomberg News quoted Hart as saying. He added that if people can’t travel to the country, it will “decline as an investment destination.”According to AmCham China’s 2022 annual report, “with respect to the two-year business outlook, there was an 11-point decline in optimism related to domestic market growth and an 18-point decline related to economic growth and recovery.”“The increasing lack of optimism in market growth and economic recovery may be related to China’s slowing economic growth rate, which has been adversely impacted by pandemic-related restrictions across the country,” the report says. “While China is still viewed as a profitable and valuable market, the increasing overall market uncertainties make companies wary of predicting large gains in China over the short-to-medium term.”European companies in China share similar concerns.Bloomberg News reported in May that many European companies in China “are putting investment plans on pause and starting to consider whether to leave the country,” and that “[u]ncertainties about a potential next wave of outbreaks are taking a heavy toll on business confidence.”Bloomberg News quoted Massimo Bagnasco, vice president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, as saying: “Uncertainty is really the keyword, because there’s no view, no outlook about how long this could last, and what will be next after Shanghai.”Shanghai, China’s largest city and a financial hub, was at the epicenter of the country’s worst COVID-19 outbreak last March after the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. The city of 26 million people was under a strict months-long lockdown, with residents confined to their homes and businesses abruptly put on hold.The EU Chamber’s 2022 Business Confidence Survey, a flash survey conducted April 21-27 and issued in June, found that “while most [two-thirds] European companies in China posted positive revenues and were profitable in 2021, doing business became more difficult for the majority (60%).”“As the rest of the world returns to a pre-pandemic level of normality, and China’s stringent COVID-19 policy exacerbates the challenges of doing business, many European Chamber members are questioning just how many eggs they are willing to keep in their China basket,” the Chamber said in a press release accompanying the survey.The flash survey showed that 23% of respondents were “considering shifting current or planned investments out of China as a result of its more stringent COVID-19 restrictions … the highest proportion in a decade.” And 77% of respondents reported that “the measures have decreased China’s attractiveness as a future investment destination.” Sixty percent of the respondents lowered their revenue projections for 2022, the survey said.“The only thing predictable about China today is its unpredictability, and that is poisonous for the business environment,” said Bettina Schoen-Behanzin, vice president of the EU Chamber in China, in a press release about the 2022 survey. “Increasing numbers of European businesses are putting China investments on hold and re-evaluating their positions in the market as they wait to see how long this uncertainty will continue, and many are looking toward other destinations for future projects.”According to a flash survey conducted May 6-8 by the German Chamber of Commerce in China, nearly 30% of those surveyed said they had plans to leave China due to its COVID policies.The Japan Times newspaper reported in June that Japanese companies “have become more reluctant to expand their investment in China,” blaming China’s zero-COVID policy.In June, Tokyo Shoko Research, a corporate research agency, conducted an online survey that received responses from 5,799 large and small Japanese enterprises.According to The Japan Times, Tokyo Shoko Research found that Japanese companies are “‘likely to be compelled to review’ their business plans and strategies for operating in China in the face of the ‘vulnerability’ of the country's supply chains and logistics.”Japan’s Nikkei Asia newspaper, citing a survey by the Shanghai Japanese Commerce and Industry Club, reported that 14% of the Japanese companies operating in Shanghai “plan to ‘reduce’ or ‘postpone’ future investments in China.” Thirty-nine percent said they “did not know yet.”;https://www.ccpit.org/image/1273893138053726209/c8f8ccbe44374d8aa7e2fe032389109e.pdf,https://www.amchamchina.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AmCham-China-Flash-Survey-Results-of-COVID-19-Business-Impact_FINAL.pdf,https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150456/shanghai-maintains-zero-covid-policy-but-the-u-n-says-it-is-not-sustainable,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-strict-zero-covid-policy-creates-supply-chain-chaos-/6591227.html,https://www.reuters.com/markets/financials/chinas-covid-controls-will-impact-foreign-investment-years-us-lobby-2022-05-17/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/us-firms-in-china-may-reconsider-investment-after-lockdowns,https://www.amchamchina.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WP2022-Final.pdf,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/us-firms-in-china-may-reconsider-investment-after-lockdowns,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-misleading-covid-deaths/31816854.html,https://www.wsj.com/articles/shanghais-covid-lockdown-legacy-confusion-despair-departure-11656149401,https://www.europeanchamber.com.cn/en/press-releases/3445,https://china.ahk.de/news/news-details/german-chamber-flash-survey-may-2022,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/07/21/business/japan-china-investment-covid/,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Poll-finds-14-of-Japan-companies-in-Shanghai-shifting-investments;‘Fully Confident’?

Charter;2022-08-18;polygraph;;"Addressing the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security on August 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that his war on Ukraine does not violate the U.N. Charter and was launched to protect the residents of Ukraine’s Donbas region from “genocide.”“We have taken the decision to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine, a decision which is in full conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. It has been clearly spelled out that the aims of this operation are to ensure the security of Russia and its citizens and protect the residents of Donbas from genocide,"" he said.That statement is false.The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated not only the U.N. Charter, but also international law and even Russian law. Moreover, under international criminal law, the invasion is viewed as a crime of aggression.The United Nations CharterArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity of another state: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”Russia has used military force against Ukraine and violated its territorial integrity by wholly or partially occupying six of its regions.On February 24, the day Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that Russia had violated the U.N. Charter.“The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country committed to uphold. This applies to the present military offensive. It is wrong. It is against the (United Nations) Charter. It is unacceptable,” Guterres told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York City. Russia has previously stated, falsely, that its military aggression against Ukraine is in line with Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. But Article 51 provides that “nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations,” and Ukraine never attacked Russia.Yet, Putin, after claiming Russia's invasion of Ukraine was launched in compliance with the U.N. Charter, asserted that there was a threat to Russia's security in the Donbas region of Ukraine and that genocide was taking place there.Let's see if there is any truth to these claims.An armed attack against RussiaMoscow has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was planning an attack on Russia and the Russian-occupied territories of the Donbas. There is no evidence for that claim. Ukraine did not attack or threaten to carry out an armed attack on Russia.Since its emergence as an independent country in 1991, Ukraine has not initiated a single war. The Russian Federation, on the other hand, has launched four wars since 1991: the First Chechen War (1994-1996), Second Chechen War (1999-2009), Russo-Georgian War (2008) and Russo-Ukrainian War (2014-present). A comparison of the Russian and Ukrainian armies makes it highly unlikely that Ukraine planned to initiate a war with Russia. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia's military spending in 2021 was $65.9 billion, 11 times more than Ukraine's $5.9 billion in military spending that same year.According to Statista.com, at the beginning of 2022, Russia had 4.5 times more active soldiers than Ukraine, 13.1 times more warplanes and 13.8 times more helicopters.According to GlobalFirepower.com, before the war, Russia had 4.8 times more tanks than Ukraine, 2.4 times more armored vehicles and 4.6 times more self-propelled and towed artillery.Genocide in the DonbasThe international community recognized genocide as a crime in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ratified by 149 countries. The Convention defined genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”A majority of the population of the Donbas, according to the latest Ukrainian census in 2001, are ethnic Ukrainians, while ethnic Russians are the largest minority. Orthodox Christians are the largest religious group in the Donbas. That is basically the same as the ethnic and religious breakdowns in Ukraine’s other regions. Russia orchestrated and fueled the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine after annexing Crimea in 2014, and therefore is responsible for the bloodshed and suffering that followed.According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), civilian deaths due to the hostilities in the Donbas have been steadily decreasing over the past five years. In 2017, 87 civilians were killed in clashes between the Ukrainian army and the forces of the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic,” the Russia-backed entities in the Donbas; 43 civilians died there in 2018; 19 in 2019; and 12 in 2020.Authorities in the “Donetsk People’s Republic” say only seven civilians were killed in fighting there in 2021.According to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), between February 24, the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and July 24, 2022, there were 12,272 civilian casualties in Ukraine - 5,237 killed and 7,035 injured. Most of those killed were ethnic Ukrainians.As of August 18, the national parliaments of Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Canada, Lithuania, Poland, Czechia and Ireland had recognized Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an act of genocide. Ireland's parliament said that Russia ""has perpetrated barbaric acts of murder, rape, desecration of corpses and the wide-scale use of heavy military equipment against civilians.” On April 12, U.S. President Joseph Biden said the atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine amounted to ""genocide.""";http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69166,https://www.cfr.org/article/how-russias-invasion-ukraine-violates-international-law,https://theconversation.com/is-international-law-powerless-against-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-no-but-its-complicated-177905,https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/76d05ec44f1dfdc1272245049c8da8bb66dd9198/,https://theconversation.com/is-international-law-powerless-against-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-no-but-its-complicated-177905,https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text,https://www.ejiltalk.org/what-is-russias-legal-justification-for-using-force-against-ukraine/,https://liveuamap.com/uk,https://twitter.com/UNWebTV/status/1496911963024154628,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843,https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text,https://regnum.ru/news/polit/3586735.html,https://www.mk.ru/politics/2022/03/10/lavrov-zayavil-chto-ukraina-planirovala-napadeniya-na-donbass.html,https://www.cfr.org/article/how-russias-invasion-ukraine-violates-international-law,https://theconversation.com/international-law-says-putins-war-against-ukraine-is-illegal-does-that-matter-177438,https://histerl.ru/vse_mareriali/tablici/voini_v_kotorix_uchastvovala_rossia.htm,https://ukrainer.net/voyny-rossyy/,https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/fs_2204_milex_2021_0.pdf,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1296573/russia-ukraine-military-comparison/,https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.php?country1=ukraine&country2=russia,https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/genocide-timeline,https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf,https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/genocide,http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/nationality/donetsk/,http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/nationality/lugansk/,https://ratinggroup.ua/ru/research/ukraine/religioznye_predpochteniya_naseleniya_ukrainy.html,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/d/9/469737.pdf,https://www.interfax.ru/world/813458,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/07/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-25-july-2022,https://www.rada.gov.ua/news/razom/221761.html,https://www.riigikogu.ee/istungi-ulevaated/riigikogu-vottis-vastu-avalduse-venemaa-sojakuritegudest-ja-genotsiidist-ukrainas/,https://titania.saeima.lv/LIVS13/saeimalivs_lmp.nsf/0/6D3B896E469E534AC22588240030473C?OpenDocument,https://www.reuters.com/world/canada-lawmakers-vote-unanimously-label-russias-acts-ukraine-genocide-2022-04-27/,https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/lietuvos-seimas-rusija-pripazino-teroristine-valstybe.d?id=90178141,https://hromadske.ua/ru/posts/uzhe-7-parlamentov-mira-priznali-dejstviya-rossijskih-okkupantov-genocidom-ukrainskogo-naroda-stefanchuk,https://www.politico.eu/article/czech-senate-recognize-russia-actions-ukraine-genocide/,https://www.justsecurity.org/81564/compilation-of-countries-statements-calling-russian-actions-in-ukraine-genocide/,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-calls-putin-actions-ukraine-genocide-rcna24131;Putin Falsely Claims Ukraine Invasion ‘In Full Conformity’ with U.N.

(AFP)In turn, the Russian state broadcaster Sputnik reported on August 16:“The national stability and peaceful environment in Myanmar ‘are the most important factors for elections,’ the prime minister [Min Aung Hlaing] said, adding that the incumbent government ‘is doing its best to maintain the rule of law, national security, and stability.’”But claiming the junta is creating “stability” under “rule of law” is false. In fact, the military is the primary driver of lawlessness and instability in the country.Since the coup, Myanmar’s junta has maintained its grip on power against the popular will through violence. Rather than pave the way for fair elections, the junta continues to persecute former members of the elected government it ousted.The U.N.’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) gathered evidence revealing that “since the military takeover in February 2021, crimes have been committed in Myanmar on a scale and in a manner that constitutes a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population.”Those crimes against humanity include murder, torture, deportation, forcible transfer, rape and other forms of sexual violence. The IIMM also found “substantial evidence” the junta has engaged in “the widespread burning of villages and towns, and of targeted or indiscriminate killing of civilians.”Human rights groups like Britain’s Amnesty International have documented how the military rulers “inflicted collective punishment on civilians,” carrying out both widespread and systematic attacks that kill and injure noncombatants.As of August 16, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), run by Myanmar citizens in exile, said 2,201 “people, pro-democracy activists and other civilians” have been killed in the post-coup crackdown.The U.N. said the IIMM’s annual report was released shortly before the fifth anniversary of the Myanmar military’s “widespread and systematic campaign of violence” against the Rohingya Muslim minority, a campaign the United States and others have called genocide and that sparked a mass exodus of refugees.Last month, Myanmar announced it had executed four democracy activists – the country’s first executions in decades. The men were tried in closed military courts and denied the right to appeal.The IIMM said the circumstances in which those men were sentenced to death “could constitute the crime of murder, openly carried out by an organ of government.”The junta has sentenced more than 100 others to death since the coup. On August 17, Heyzer called on the military to ""impose a moratorium on all future executions."" Analysts say fresh elections, tentatively planned for next year, will be used to install a pro-military government.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States “strongly encourages the international community not to endorse the regime's plans for sham elections next year,” adding, “[T]hey can be neither free nor fair under present conditions.”Analysts also say the prosecution of Su Kyi and other members of her government is intended to sideline the opposition ahead of the elections.Anti-coup protesters display pictures of deposed Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon on March 2, 2021. (Associated Press)The military-controlled Union Election Commission recently said political parties could see their registration “dissolved” if they meet with foreign organizations or individuals.Myanmar’s neighbors are increasingly angered by the junta’s actions.On August 3, Malaysia Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said Myanmar’s military rulers had frustrated other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by failing to progress on ASEAN’s five-point consensus peace plan.On August 6, foreign ministers from ASEAN’s 10 member nations said Myanmar’s military rulers would be banned from further ASEAN meetings until that changed.On August 15, Saifuddin said the recent sentencing of Suu Kyi and execution of the democracy activists showed the junta was ignoring calls to earnestly engage the opposition and end violence in the country.Myanmar’s military rulers say ASEAN is violating its policy of non-interference.And to be sure, the military is not the only armed force killing civilians.The Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security, a non-governmental think tank, reports that targeted killings ""are no longer a Tatmadaw (military) preserve but are used as a favored tactic by new armed groups.""The group's 2020-2021 security report published this year notes that members of the local People’s Defence Forces (PDFs), armed opposition groups that rose up to fight back against the military, also started ""a campaign of targeted killings and bombings"" in May 2021.The report argues their aim is ""to prevent the junta from establishing its governance on the local level."" The attacks have also been carried out as retaliation for the military's ""blatant and widespread murder and detention of civilians,"" with the selection of targets ""less-than-precise.""""The campaign against [military] forces has included attacks on township ward officials, police, Tatmadaw veterans, administrators, social workers, members of pro-Tatmadaw militias and pro-military political parties, as well as alleged regime informants, who have accounted for most deaths,"" the report found. It added those attacks have resulted ""in hundreds of deaths and injuries.""Some analysts question whether any count of civilian casualties can accurately attribute responsibility given the complexities of fighting among the military, PDFs and ethnic armed groups that have long been involved in regional conflicts.The Institute for Strategy & Policy – Myanmar, another think tank tracking post-coup data, estimated nearly 5,700 civilian deaths through May, according to Radio Free Asia, a sister U.S.-funded news organization to Voice of America and Polygraph.info. RFA said:""The numbers are largely in line with reporting by RFA’s Myanmar Service, which had documented at least 5,683 civilian deaths between the military takeover and May 12. On May 10 alone, junta troops slaughtered 29 civilians in Mon Taing Pin village, in Sagaing region’s Ye Oo township, sources recently told RFA, saying the victims appeared to have been 'killed and burned intentionally' by soldiers targeting residents in retaliation for alleged ties to the PDF.""It is no coincidence that Min Aung Hlaing delivered his comments at a Moscow-organized forum.As Polygraph.info previously reported, Russia has sought to deepen defense and security cooperation with Myanmar since the coup, highlighted by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s official visit to Myanmar on August 3.Myanmar’s military has widely used Russian-made military hardware as it seeks to stamp out opposition.Rights groups like Justice for Myanmar have accused Moscow of “aiding and abetting the military’s genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.”";https://www.voanews.com/a/un-envoy-arrives-in-myanmar/6703294.html,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1124762,https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-philanthropy-aung-san-suu-kyi-government-and-politics-65b31bda03227a2bf73e3b26cea32b12,https://sputniknews.com/20220816/myanmars-leader-says-general-election-to-take-place-if-situation-stable-peaceful-1099659382.html,https://iimm.un.org/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/punishment-06012022162740.html,https://twitter.com/aapp_burma/status/1559554170897989633,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-how-myanmar-distorts-years-of-brutality-toward-rohingyas/31918371.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/court-sentences-young-main-to-death-by-hanging-06032022053346.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/extension-08012022184115.html,https://mizzima.com/article/us-urges-rejection-myanmar-junta-sham-elections,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/myanmar-court-adds-six-years-to-suu-kyi-prison-sentence-with-corruption-charges,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-frustrating-everyone-over-peace-plan-malaysia-minister-2022-08-03/,https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/Chairmans-Statement-on-ALM-Five-Point-Consensus-24-April-2021-FINAL-a-1.pdf,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/6/myanmar-generals-banned-from-asean-until-peace-plan-progress,https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/cambodian-pm-urges-myanmar-not-to-execute-political-prisoners/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-hits-back-asean-after-being-barred-meetings-2022-08-17/,https://mips-mm.org/download/annual-peace-security-review-2020-2021/,https://asiatimes.com/2022/04/fog-of-stats-enshrouds-myanmars-wars/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-moscow-fuels-myanmar-war-machine-then-claims-to-bring-peace/31975720.html,https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/press-releases/justice-for-myanmar-calls-for-sanctions-on-19-russian-suppliers-of-arms-and-related-equipment-to-the-myanmar-military;Myanmar Junta’s False Claims to ‘Stability’ and ‘Rule of Law’;;;;;;

Stories appeared in Vzglyad, UF.ru, AIF, Tsargrad, Evening Moscow, Business Gazeta, and others trended on Yandex.ru.The reports came as the United States announced a new round of military aid for Ukraine, worth $1 billion, that includes 1,000 Javelins and other high-tech weaponry and ammunition.Russian disinformation has been trash talking the Western weapons flowing into Ukraine. What’s different this time is the claim that the U.S. manufacturer of Javelins, Raytheon Missiles & Defense, admitted that its weapons didn’t work.These latest reports originated from an RT (Russia Today) “investigation,” headlined: “The fall of ‘Saint Javelin’: Why the Javelin has proven ineffective in Ukraine.”RT claimed to have obtained internal Raytheon documents, and embedded in the piece three infographics, one marked with the “Raytheon Missile Systems” logo, that compare the technical characteristics of similar weapons systems, and argue they prove that Javelins are inferior.Those claims are false. The infographics are not from Raytheon, and Ukraine has used Javelins to destroy Russia’s best tanks.“Those documents were not created by our company, and the efficacy of the Javelin speaks for itself,” Mike Nachshen, senior director of international communications at Raytheon, told Polygraph.info when asked about the RT report.In fact, the Javelins have been praised as a game-changer.Javelins are “probably the most sophisticated and most powerful” anti-tank weapon, Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Stars and Stripes military news outlet in March.Stars and Stripes described the Javelin’s advantages, including its ability to lock “onto a target’s thermal picture,” light weight, the reduced debris and smoke from its launch and the increased safety for its operators. Javelin operators do not need to track the target, allowing them to change position and reload.“While the Javelin can target any kind of vehicle that emits heat, it is most potent against tanks since it can strike from the top.” Stars and Stripes wrote. “This is why it’s called a Javelin, like the spear thrown in track and field events that falls to the earth at a steep angle.”The Javelin’s effectiveness in Ukraine prompted the British military to purchase 513 of them from Raytheon, in a deal worth $300 million, The National Interest reported on August 9.The reference to “Saint Javelin” in RT’s headline reflects the U.S. missiles' wide popularity in Ukraine. A cartoon of Mary Magdalene holding a Javelin missile has become an iconic symbol of Ukraine’s “seemingly miraculous resistance against overwhelming Russian forces,” wrote Matthew Parent, from the Belfer Center at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, in March.Ukrainians have painted murals and written songs about Saint Javelin.A Saint Javelin charity run by a Canadian raised more than $1 million in donations to aid Ukraine’s armed forces.“Ukrainians are cleverly using Javelin missiles to destroy Russian armor,” The National Interest defense editor Kris Osborn wrote in February. “[T]he U.S. Department of Defense has been clear that sending Javelins may prove to be a crucial factor in stopping Russian attacks and giving new life to Ukrainian fighters.”The latest aid package brings total U.S. military support for Ukraine to $9.8 billion since Russia launched its full-scale invasion February.Polygraph.info has debunked other false Russian claims that the U.S. has been supplying Ukraine with “junk.”Are NATO States Sending Ukraine’s Navy ‘Junk’ Vessels?Why Russian Trash Talks ‘U.S.-Gifted HIMARS’ Weapons in UkrainePro-Russian Disinfo Spreads About U.S. Arms ShipmentsDid a Ukrainian Politician Really Say Ukrainian Troops Can’t Learn How to Use American Weapons?;https://vz.ru/news/2022/8/10/1172026.html,https://u-f.ru/news/army/u6624/2022/08/11/342993?ysclid=l6oyojnh5d169643506,https://aif.ru/politics/world/kompleksy_javelin_okazalis_neeffektivnymi_na_ukraine,https://tsargrad.tv/news/polkovnik-vsu-kompleksy-javelin-okazalis-bespolezny-dlja-ukrainy_602653?ysclid=l6oyooecjf489718863,https://vm.ru/news/988015-eksperty-poyasnili-pochemu-javelin-okazalsya-neeffektiven-na-ukraine?ysclid=l6oyoyl8yc963038189,https://www.business-gazeta.ru/news/559783?ysclid=l6oyp58zqb914849393,https://www.newsweek.com/us-sending-ukraine-more-himars-missiles-massive-defense-package-1731909,https://russian.rt.com/ussr/article/1035577-javelin-ukraina-effektivnost-rassledovanie,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-08-05/ukraine-war-javelin-missiles-6888865.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/05/ukraine-war-javelins-russia-tanks/,https://bigthink.com/the-present/javelin-missiles-darpa-ukraine/,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-03-11/what-to-know-about-the-role-javelin-antitank-missiles-could-play-ukraine-russia-5313969.html,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/lessons-ukraine-britain-buys-hundreds-lightweight-javelin-missiles-204116,https://factsminister.com/st-javelin-a-symbol-of-the-ukrainian-resistance-in-war/,https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/ukraine-javelin-more-weapon,https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1532678482739740673?s=20&t=ICO6TSqPBX75dyrnYnY6jw,https://twitter.com/saintjavelin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60700906,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ukrainians-are-cleverly-using-javelin-missiles-destroy-russian-armor-200889,https://www.businessinsider.com/javelins-stingers-nlaws-help-ukraine-destroy-russian-tanks-aircraft-2022-3?op=1,https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/08/08/us-to-send-ukraine-another-1-billion-in-military-aid/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-ukraine-navy-nato-russia/29869004.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-why-russia-trash-talks-us-gifted-himars-to-ukraine/31973768.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-pro-russian-disinfo-spreads-about-u-s-arms-shipments/31674764.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukrainian-soldiers-can-use-american-weapons/29162867.html;Russian Media Fabricate ‘Leak’ From U.S. Defense Contractor to Tarnish ‘Saint Javelin’;;;;;;

The previous day, Blinken spoke in South Africa, outlining the U.S. strategy for sub-Saharan Africa.Blinken stressed “the connection between democracy and security”; food insecurity; and COVID-19-related “economic pain,” exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The White House released an accompanying fact sheet. It claimed the U.S. and its allies across the world “increasingly regard Africa as integral to their national security” but also included this harsh assessment of China:“The People’s Republic of China (PRC), by contrast, sees the region as an important arena to challenge the rules-based international order, advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests, undermine transparency and openness, and weaken U.S. relations with African peoples and governments.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Antoinette Sithole, the sister of the late Hector Pieterson, tour the Hector Pieterson Memorial in Soweto, South Africa,on August 7, 2022. (Andrew Harnik/Reuters)China took umbrage. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted side-by-side photographs from Africa, apparently to draw a contrast.One shows a Chinese surveyor, with the caption: “China shares mapping technique in Africa.” The other, with a U.S. soldier crouching over an African aiming a rifle, is captioned: “The U.S. offers shooting training in Africa.”Zhao’s tweet: “#China brings techniques to #Africa. The #US brings violence to Africa.”That is false.The 10-year-old photo actually shows a U.S. Marine training a member of the Uganda People’s Defense Force in combat marksmanship.The Ugandan soldiers were combat engineers receiving counterinsurgency training to fight Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, a Somali Islamist militant group.The combat engineers were sent to support Ugandan infantry already deployed as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), a regional peace-keeping mission unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council, which includes China, on December 6, 2006.In other words, China had approved of the very training shown in the photo.AMISOM's mandate recently ended on March 31, and it was replaced by an African Union Transition Mission in Somalia.In August 2021, Dai Bing, the charge d'affaires of China's permanent mission to the United Nations, also expressed China’s support for AMISOM.Similar images of Chinese troops training soldiers in Africa are also publicly available.A photograph of Chinese Marines training South African troops on an unspecified date posted to the Website of Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base. (Dr. Ernest Gunasekara-Rockwell).So, what is China really up to in Africa? It's a mixed bag.For one, China has outpaced the United States on the development front. In April, Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, told the VOA’s Kate Bartlett that aside from foreign aid, China is a bigger economic player on the continent than the U.S. in every area.China’s investment in Africa is tied to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its $1 trillion trade and diplomatic program to connect with Eurasia and Africa.The Indian academic Brahma Chellaney and various Western officials have accused China of engaging in “debt trap” diplomacy under the BRI, by which unsustainable debt is leveraged for geopolitical ends. Beijing and some independent Western analysts dispute that China has been so onerous as a lender.On the military front, Bejing has an increasing presence in Africa, selling arms and providing training.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported in March that China was the third-largest major arms supplier to Africa from 2017-2021, accounting for 10% of shipments.Russia was by far the largest supplier of major arms to Africa, accounting for 44% of the total. The United States was second, at 17%.Some argue that China’s arms shipments to Africa are profit-driven. Others say there is a strategic component.As in the case of Myanmar’s military regime, China sells arms “with the full knowledge they would likely be used in attacks against civilians,” the U.N.'s special rapporteur on Myanmarr reported in February. Academic analysts say China maintains a “no questions asked” arms export model, with human rights considered an “internal affair.”The Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs, a peer-reviewed journal of the United States Air Force and Space Force, has accused Beijing of “implicitly” sanctioning “the unrestrained flow of weapons to conflict zones.”For example, while the United States was training Ugandan forces in 2012 to combat an insurgency in Somalia, weapons from China “surfaced in a string of U.N. investigations in war zones stretching from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Ivory Coast, Somalia and Sudan,” The Washington Post reported.The newspaper noted that China “stood apart from other major arms exporters, including Russia, for its assertive challenge to U.N. authority,” stifling attempts by U.N. experts to track the flow of arms to Africa and elsewhere.Meantime, China is also pushing a Global Security Initiative to realize its own vision of “indivisible security.”Beijing presents the initiative as a truly multilateral program to “maintain world peace and prevent conflicts and wars.” Critics say it “would usher in a global system friendlier to repressive regimes than the current order, grounded as it is in democratic ideals.”Through that initiative, China aims, in part, to beef up its military presence on the continent.A July 31 article in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), headlined “China using its new Global Security Initiative to build military standing in Africa,” states as much:“China is promoting its new Global Security Initiative as a way to boost ties with African nations through military training, intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism – even as Western powers like France and the U.S. face resistance or are cutting back on their African military operations.”The SCMP report noted that Beijing has “contributed thousands of troops to the United Nations peace-keeping missions,” is “training more military officials,” “and seeks further involvement in the peace process in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel regions.”Writing for the European Council on Foreign Relations, Michael Tanchum, an academic and expert on Sub-Saharan Africa, said China had provided “more troops to U.N. Security Council peace-keeping missions than all the other U.N.S.C. permanent members combined.”Tanchum argues that under the auspices of the U.N., Beijing is “able to portray its unilateral military presence as part of the international effort to combat piracy and protect global trade passing through the Suez Canal.”The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government, wrote in a December 2020 study: “Chinese leaders aspire to project force and be capable of fighting a limited war overseas to protect its interests in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).”To achieve that end, Tanchum wrote, “Beijing has integrated a military and security component into its economic partnerships with African states,” weaving China’s defense presence into “the fabric of the continent’s development.”Africa is also the site of China’s first military base abroad.In 2017, China opened a military base in Djibouti, an east African state in the Horn of Africa (Somali Peninsula). The base is intended, in part, to facilitate participation in U.N. peace-keeping missions and anti-piracy operations.Reports suggest that China is also looking to open a second naval base on Africa’s Atlantic Coast, in the central African country of Equatorial Guinea.";https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-arrives-in-drc-regional-stability-tops-agenda/6694772.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-gives-us-africa-strategy-address-in-pretoria-/6693457.html,https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FVOANews%2Fstatus%2F1556218595641765888&widget=Tweet,https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/U.S.-Strategy-Toward-Sub-Saharan-Africa-FINAL.pdf,https://www.armyrecognition.com/armies_in_the_world_analysis_focus/u.s._marine_corps_forces_train_soldiers_ugandan_army_counter-%20terrorism_combat_engineering_2203124.html,https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1725(2006),https://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-08/13/c_1310124325.htm,https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/News/Photos/igphoto/2002838231/,https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2021/04/02/why-substantial-chinese-fdi-is-flowing-into-africa-foreign-direct-investment/\,https://www.voanews.com/a/the-new-scramble-for-africa-china-seen-outpacing-us-/6526446.html,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01?barrier=accesspaylog,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/wjbz_663308/activities_663312/202201/t20220107_10479837.html,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/02/china-debt-trap-diplomacy/617953/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/the-myth-of-chinese-debt-trap-diplomacy-in-africa,https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/fs_2203_at_2021.pdf,https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2021/04/20/assessing-the-impact-of-chinese-arms-in-africa/#_edn4,https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-14_Issue-1/Raska.pdf,https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-expert-myanmar-junta-using-weapons-from-russia-and-china-against-civilians-/6453749.html,https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/14058/China_arms_export_strategy-2017.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2743926/to-honor-its-commitment-to-un-arms-trade-treaty-china-must-sacrifice/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinas-arms-exports-flooding-sub-saharan-africa/2012/08/25/16267b68-e7f1-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_story.html,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/202205/t20220523_10691328.html,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/07/china-xi-jinping-global-security-initiative/670504/,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3187151/china-using-its-new-global-security-initiative-build-military?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article&campaign=3187151,https://ecfr.eu/article/chinas-new-military-base-in-africa-what-it-means-for-europe-and-america/,https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/2020_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf,https://ecfr.eu/article/chinas-new-military-base-in-africa-what-it-means-for-europe-and-america/,https://africacenter.org/spotlight/considerations-prospective-chinese-naval-base-africa/;Beijing Lies About a Photo to Smear Blinken’s Outreach in Africa;;;;;;

(Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters)Myanmar has spiraled into chaos since February 2021, when the military seized power by force from the elected government.As of August 5, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), run by Myanmar citizens in exile, said 2,158 “people, pro-democracy activists and other civilians” have been killed as a result of the post-coup military crackdown.Lavrov said Russia stood in solidarity with “efforts to stabilize the situation in the country” and welcomed planned elections next year. Analysts say the elections will be used to install a pro-military government.Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, weighed in on what she described as Lavrov’s “rich visit.” In reference to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent trip to Taiwan, Zakharova said Lavrov visited “to promote cooperation,” rather than provoke China.“Russia brings cooperation, peace, [and] stability to the region. Russia operates on the basis of international law, mutual respect and the mutual consideration of interests,"" Russian state broadcaster Sputnik quoted Zakharova as saying.That is false. Russia, as a major supplier of arms to Myanmar’s military government, is doing anything but bringing peace and stability to the region.Russia, along with China, blocked the United Nations from condemning the February 2021 coup, a move that fit a long-standing pattern of shielding Myanmar’s military from international rebuke for rights abuses and waging war on its own people.In the month following the coup, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin visited Myanmar to solicit arms sales. That visit overlapped with the bloodiest day of protests since the military takeover, with the military reportedly killing scores of people, including children, according to news reports.During a speech on Armed Forces Day (March 27), when the crackdown occurred, Myanmar’s military leader Min Aung Hlaing called Russia a “true friend.” Fomin received a metal from Min Aung Hlaing the previous day.Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Alekaandr Fomin (L) receives a medal from Myanmar armed forces chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw on March 26, 2021. (Myanmar Radio and Television/via AFP)As summarized by the International Crisis Group, “Russia has thrown Naypyitaw (Myanmar’s capital) a lifeline as it struggles to quash domestic resistance and secure international legitimacy, thus further antagonizing countries pushing for Myanmar’s return to democracy.”Myanmar’s military rulers, in turn, supported Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Russia was working “to consolidate its sovereignty.”During his Myanmar trip, Lavrov thanked the Myanmar junta for its “balanced and responsible stance” on the war in Ukraine. Lavrov stressed the role of military cooperation and security in Russia’s relationship with Myanmar, announcing the two sides would hold talks on military-technical cooperation in Russia later this month.Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attends a meeting with Myanmar's Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin in Naypyidaw, on August 3, 2022. (Russian Foreign Ministry/via Reuters)In July, Russia and Myanmar announced they would deepen defense collaboration after Min Aung Hlaing made an unannounced visit to Moscow. A July 21 report from the Hong-Kong based Asia Times said, “Russia has emerged as the most outspoken global power to support [Myanmar’s] military junta.”That report noted that Russian-made military hardware, including Hind Mi-35 helicopter gunships, transport helicopters, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 ground attack aircraft are being used in assaults on ethnic rebels in border areas, where other pro-democracy protesters have taken refuge.“The assaults using Russian hardware are contributing to a new regional humanitarian crisis as refugees stream toward the Thai and Indian borders,” Asia Times reported.Radio Free Asia, a sister U.S.-funded news organization to Voice of America, has documented the use of Russian jets and attack helicopters to carry out airstrikes, at times firing into villages indiscriminately.As noted in a February 2021 report from Japan’s Nikkei Asia, many of the light armored vehicles rolling through the streets at the onset of the coup were of Russian-design.Nikkei Asia reported that just days before the military takeover, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu visited Myanmar to finalize a weapons deal, which included the Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile system, Orlan-10E surveillance drones and radar equipment.In February, Myanmar’s independent Irrawaddy news reported a Russian military delegation including pilots visited the country as the regime ramped up air attacks on ethnic armed organizations and opposition People’s Defense Force groups.In August 2021, a Myanmar military spokesman said: “Russia plays the central part in Myanmar’s air defense systems, followed by China.” He added that “cooperation between the air forces is expanding,” the Irrawaddy reported.The anti-corruption group Justice for Myanmar said Russia is “a major supplier of arms and dual use goods for the Myanmar military.”The group accused Moscow of “aiding and abetting the military’s genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.”The group has called for sanctions against 19 Russian companies, many of which have continued to ship arms to Myanmar since the coup.Investigators at the rights group Myanmar Witness found Myanmar’s military had used Yak-130 aircraft acquired from Russia to unleash “unguided rockets and 23mm cannon fire in and around civilian-populated areas.”On July 4, The Irrawaddy reported Russia had delivered two of six new Su-30 fighter jets to Myanmar in March, citing sources who formerly served with the Myanmar Air Force.However, in their report, published July 28, Myanmar Witness said they were not aware of the Su-30 “being delivered to, nor employed by, the Myanmar military at this time.”Russia, which for years was Southeast Asia's leading arms supplier, has seen sales plummet following sanctions over its 2014 seizure of Crimea and expanded invasion of Ukraine in February.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-myanmar-junta-falsely-claims-executed-activists-had-fair-trials/31960936.html,https://tass.com/politics/1488491,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/extension-08012022184115.html,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20220803/mchnma-1806830945.html,https://www.rt.com/russia/560094-lavrov-pelosi-asia-trips/,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20220803/mchnma-1806830945.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/china-russia-block-un-security-council-condemn-myanmar-coup-2021-2,https://news.un.org/en/story/2007/01/205732-china-and-russia-veto-usuk-backed-security-council-draft-resolution-myanmar,https://thediplomat.com/2022/05/are-russian-arms-exports-to-southeast-asia-a-thing-of-the-past/,https://www.rferl.org/a/burma-russia-military-parade-armed-forces-day/31172189.html,https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/b173-coming-terms-myanmars-russia-embrace,https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-military-council-supports-russia-s-invasion-0f-ukraine/6458527.html,https://tass.com/politics/1488571,https://tass.com/politics/1488757,https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-says-it-will-deepen-defence-cooperation-with-myanmar-2022-07-12/,https://asiatimes.com/2021/07/russia-lends-myanmar-a-lethal-helping-hand/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/airstrikes-06302022185552.html

That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level,” Blinken said.Two days later, Russia’s U.N. mission issued a rebuttal:“We reject the unfounded accusations that Russia prevents the IAEA inspectors from visiting the Zaporizhzhia NPP and, especially, absolutely absurd speculation that a military base is allegedly being set up there.”That is false. Credible reports say Russian troops have militarized the plant, putting up perimeter defenses, firing artillery from the grounds and effectively turning it into a base of operations shielded by the risk of a radioactive release.Russian troops first hit the Zaporizhzhia plant in March with strikes that set buildings inside the perimeter ablaze. The fire triggered a panicked exodus of locals and set off global alarms.Ukrainian authorities calmed the situation after putting out the fire and announcing that the reactors were safe. The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said a Russian “projectile” had struck a training center on the grounds.But uncertainty mounted as Russian forces settled in. The IAEA said in May that, despite international pressure, Russia had not guaranteed safe access for inspectors to visit.Ukraine’s nuclear safety agency said two of Zaporizhzhia’s reactors were operational, but that the agency is “no longer in a position to oversee nuclear safety at the site.” Ukraine’s personnel are keeping the plant safe “under extremely stressful conditions,” said the Nuclear Energy Agency, an arm of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.On July 5, The Wall Street Journal reported:“At the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine, more than 500 Russian soldiers who seized the facility in March recently have deployed heavy artillery batteries and laid anti-personnel mines along the shores of the reservoir whose water cools its six reactors, according to workers, residents, Ukrainian officials, and diplomats.”In mid-July, the chairman of Ukraine’s nuclear operator, Energoatom, said the Russians had deployed and used missile launchers on the plant site.Since then, Russia has been launching artillery rounds from the plant site across the Dnipro River into the west-bank town of Nikopol, The New York Times reported on August 1:“The Russians have been firing from the cover of the Zaporizhzhia station since mid-July, Ukrainian military and civilian officials said, sending rockets over the river at Nikopol and other targets.“It is, in effect, a free shot. Ukraine cannot unleash volleys of shells in return using American-provided advanced rocket systems, which have silenced Russian guns elsewhere on the front line. Doing so would risk striking one of the six pressurized water reactors or highly radioactive waste in storage. And Russia knows it.“‘They are hiding there so they cannot be hit,’” said Oleksandr Sayuk, the mayor of Nikopol. ‘Why else would they be at the electrical station? To use such an object as a shield is very dangerous.’ ”Ukraine said on August 4 that Russian strikes originating from the Zaporizhzhia plant damaged 50 residential buildings in Nikopol.A day earlier, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told The Associated Press: “Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, and the situation is “completely out of control.”;https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinkens-remarks-to-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-review-conference/,https://twitter.com/RussiaUN/status/1555003328987275264?s=20&t=4jjmgPgvTxXRitB0DRJtCQ,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00660-z,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/zaporizhzhia-evacuation-train-station-intl/index.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-plant-attack-33b6c1709dee937750f95c6786832840,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-plant-attack-33b6c1709dee937750f95c6786832840,https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-ukraine-s-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-safe-after-russian-strike-/6470760.html,https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-05-25/card/u-n-atomic-agency-chief-presses-for-access-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-g7vHkGVBMtlvYgYQPakd,https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_66130/ukraine-current-status-of-nuclear-power-installations,https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-87-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine?ftag=MSF0951a18,https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/tro_5705/about-us,https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-army-turns-ukraines-largest-nuclear-plant-into-a-military-base-11657035694,https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2022-07-16-live--russia-accused-of-firing-missiles-from-zaporizhia-nuclear-power-plant.B1Bv_vaJ29.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/world/europe/ukraine-south-counteroffensive-nuclear.html,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/shelling-continues-near-zaporizhzhia-power-plant-brittney-griner-verdict-expected-soon-ukraine-updates/ar-AA10iQc7,https://time.com/6203033/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-nuclear-plant-safety/;Russians Fire at Will From Europe’s Biggest Nuclear Plant, Deny it at UN;;;;;;
57;;;;False;Russian Embassy, Madrid;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-what-to-know-about-that-video-titled-time-to-move-to-russia-/6743443.html;What to Know About That Video Titled, ‘Time to Move to Russia’;2022-08-04;polygraph;;"On July 29, the Russian Embassy in Spain promoted an English language video under the headline, “Time to move to Russia.”The next day, the Russian House in Chennai (Madras), India, published the same video, praising it for “good sense of humor” and for promoting “delights of life in Russia despite sanctions.”Narrated in English by a male with an American accent, the one-minute video presents a series of professionally beautified images that put Russia in glowing light. The video went viral on Twitter, receiving millions of views – but also plenty of ridicule given the omission of death, destruction and allegations of rape, executions, torture by Russian forces that have invaded Ukraine.In fact, the video presents a false portrait of Russia’s ailing economy. It does so while working in mocking jabs at Ukraine and echoing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s narcissistic complaints that Western “cancel culture” is unfairly victimizing Russians (as opposed to innocent Ukrainians who are dying by the thousands and being swept from their homes and loved ones by the millions).The video starts with the narrator saying, “This is Russia,” accompanied by a close-up shot of the coat of arms of “Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic” – yes, the one from when Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union.The narration goes on to tick off a laundry list of things that living in Russia has to offer – cheap electricity, clean water, vodka, hospitality, etc. At the words “Beautiful Women,” the video shows an aerial shot of two girls running in a field followed immediately by a close-up of Angy Kreyda, a Ukrainian singer whose latest song “Vrazhe” (“The Enemy”) muses about Ukrainian witches cursing at Russian troops.At the words “Fertile Soil,” the video shows a field of yellow grain meeting a blue sky at the horizon – a reference to Ukraine’s national colors. Then, at the words “World Famous Literature,” the video shows pictures of Nikolay Gogol, a famed the 19th century Ukrainian-Russian writer, and Alexander Pushkin, the 19th century Russian poet of African descent.Based on those references, many Twitter users wondered if the video was a Ukrainian or Western spoof rather than Russian propaganda effort. However, Polygraph.info has confirmed that a pro-Russian Telegram channel called Signal took credit for producing the video. Signal first published it July 25 on YouTube with the hashtags “Russia,” “gas,” “sanctions” and linked to its 700,000-subscriber Telegram channel. Signal later described how the embassy posts boosted views.The Signal channel is anonymous; its “About” page only provides contact information for a generic administrator and ad buys. The administrator did not respond to Polygraph.info’s questions about ownership of the channel.Review of Signal’s content shows that it wholly supports Russia and its proxy forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. One such indicator is that Signal solicits donations for military and medical equipment for the Russian troops and allied forces.A video the channel published on July 26 on Telegram and YouTube showed a representative of the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Militia,” Eduard Basurin, delivering packages to a military truck. Captions said the packages contained a drone and medical supplies for the “Russian artillerists in the Donbas,” purchased using donations from Signal subscribers.Basurin thanked Signal for helping “to kill off and cleanse Ukraine from all the dirt that gathered in here.” A man in military uniform next to Basurin is introduced as “Steve, deputy commander of the special artillery brigade Kalmius.” The brigade has been operating in Donbas since 2014 and has become infamous for indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas.“Steve” expressed thanks for “the gift” to the “team at Signal and Nikita Tomilin,” a Russian who’s worked with past Kremlin projects to boost Putin’s popularity among young people. From 2018 to 2019, Tomilin also contributed as a political analyst to state-owned RT and the national-socialist website Svobodnya Pressa, writing critically about Ukraine and the United States. Tomilin founded a charity organization called “Repopulate Russia” and published a book, “The Russian Apocalypses,” expressing nationalist themes and Russian supremacy. On July 13, Tomilin was interviewed on “Utro Z” (Morning Z), a TV show hosted by U.S.-sanctioned Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Soloviev. In the interview, Tomilin used degrading slang to refer to Ukrainians and called for more “filtration” camps to “re-educate” them. Signal did not respond to a question about its affiliation with Tomilin.The “move to” video plays off grievances Putin aired in March, when he declared during an event attended by Russian musicians and other artists that the West was “trying to cancel a whole 1,000-year culture, our people” with the wide-ranging economic and cultural backlash against the war. “They’re now engaging in the cancel culture, even removing Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov from posters. Russian writers and books are now cancelled,” Putin said.In fact, some of that did occur. But Putin had made similar claims before February’s all-out invasion. In an October 2021 speech at a Russian conference on ""The Individual, Values and the State,"" he also brought up cancel culture, warning others “to steer clear of our home.” As the ""move to"" narration continues, it adds “Traditional Values” and “Christianity” to the list of Russian plusses. In his October speech, Putin also lashed out at transgender rights, The Washington Post reported. Following Putin, Russia is considered hostile to LGBTQ rights, and in the speech, he sought to turn the tables by ridiculing Western liberalism for reverting to “Soviet-era newspeak”: “Anyone who dares mention that men and women actually exist, which is a biological fact, risk being ostracized. ‘Parent number one’ and ‘parent number two,’ ‘birthing parent’ instead of ‘mother,’ and ‘human milk’ replacing ‘breast milk’ because it might upset the people who are unsure about their own gender.”The “move to” video’s assertion that there is no cancel culture in Russia is in fact false, as Twitter users were quick to point out. They posted memes and links to notorious anti-gay pogroms in Russia, to Russian laws stripping the LGBTQ community of basic rights and to stories about the poisoning and jailing of Putin's political opponents. Cancel culture is very real in Russia when it comes to the Ukraine war. Scores of popular public figures have been canceled for criticizing Putin’s war and calling for peace. They include rock stars, pop groups, artists, actors, athletes, journalists, TV hosts and others. Russia has gone so far as to criminalize use of the word “war” to describe its attack on Ukraine, rather than Putin’s preferred euphemism – a “special military operation.” More than 15,000 anti-war protesters were arrested in more than 150 cities in the immediate aftermath of February invasion. Regarding the video’s reference to Russia’s economy and claim that it has withstood thousands of sanctions, a Yale University study last month concluded that U.S. and European Union sanctions have caused extensive damage, despite Russia’s ability to use its vast energy supplies as a lifeline.The study’s authors found that more than 1,000 companies, representing 40 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product, had pulled out of the country. They argued that Putin has tried to put the best face on a dire situation by cherry-picking the data.“From our analysis, it becomes clear: business retreats and sanctions are catastrophically crippling the Russian economy ... Despite Putin’s delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent; the hollowing out of Russia’s domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst. “Looking ahead, there is no path out of economic oblivion for Russia as long as the allied countries remain unified in maintaining and increasing sanctions pressure against Russia.”In June, Russia defaulted on some of its international debt after being frozen out of the international financial transactions system by sanctions. Analysts said the country’s isolation and financial hardship could last for years after the war ends. The video ends ominously: “Don’t Delay … Winter is Coming,” the narrator says over footage of a pine forest sprinkled with snow. Many on Twitter interpreted the passage as a threat that Russia might cut off natural gas supplies to Europe; already Gazprom, the state-majority owned energy company, has substantially reduced flows under the pretext of technical problems. Europe formerly obtained about 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Now, European Union members are scrambling for new sources and looking toward rationing this winter.";https://twitter.com/EmbajadaRusaES/status/1552886838926479360?s=20&t=MDIuGHk6kF-1OSIO-vb5Uw,https://twitter.com/ruscult_chennai/status/1553648350188015616?s=20&t=AaeKOojz23FRbWbtOo8yAA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdEEffF7_rU,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikolay-Gogol,https://daily.jstor.org/how-alexander-pushkin-was-inspired-by-his-african-heritage/,https://t.me/ssigny/34633,https://youtu.be/mJpEwEpJPMM,https://t.me/ssigny/34633,https://youtu.be/mJpEwEpJPMM,https://cripo.com.ua/main/massovoe-ubyjstvo-y-pytky-ukraynskyh-voennoplennyh-eshhe-odno-voennoe-prestuplenye-putynskoj-armyy/,https://medium.com/dfrlab/the-use-of-krasnopol-artillery-shells-in-ukraine-d185ef4743b7,https://myrotvorets.center/criminal/tomilin-nikita-sergeevich/ ,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-youth-putin-idUSL1970842120070719 ,https://russian.rt.com/opinion/blog/nikita-tomilin ,https://svpressa.ru/authors/nikita-tomilin/ ,http://reprus.org/support,https://www.labirint.ru/books/364464/ ,https://smotrim.ru/video/2425196 ,https://www.thedailybeast.com/sanctioned-russian-tv-host-vladimir-soloviev-cries-about-losing-his-italian-villa ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/putin-says-west-treating-russian-culture-like-cancelled-jk-rowling ,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-west-trying-cancel-russian-culture-including-tchaikovsky-2022-03-25/ ,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66975,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/22/putin-valdai-speech-trump-cancel-culture/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/22/putin-valdai-speech-trump-cancel-culture/ ,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-lgbt-crime-idUSKBN1DL2FM ,https://sofrep.com/news/putins-poisons-a-history-of-russian-assassination-attempts/ ,https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/heres-a-list-of-all-the-putin-critics-who-wound-up-murdered/news-story/4e2952b107b0c7159887e303062c9694 ,https://riafan.ru/23567560-fan_predstavlyaet_spetsial_nii_proekt_vremya_vernih,https://riafan.ru/23564685-deputat_gd_ryabtseva_otkazalas_proschat_predatel_nitsu_hamatovu_za_begstvo_iz_rossii ,https://ryazan.life/novosti/afisha/verku-serdyuchku-i-ledi-gagu-vklyuchili-v-chyornyj-spisok-artistov-rf-un86102/ ,https://sevastopol.su/news/schitat-li-muratova-predatelem-za-prodazhu-nobelevskoy-premii-vo-imya-ukrainy ,https://ovd.news/news/2022/03/02/russian-protests-against-war-ukraine-chronicle-events,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4167193,https://www.euronews.com/2022/07/28/sanctions-catastrophically-crippling-russian-economy-study-finds ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-debt-default-is-more-serious-than-moscow-claims/31923579.html ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-russian-economy/31914022.html ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-canada-gasprom/31954098.html,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/energy/gas-fields-europe-energy-crisis-russia/index.html ;What to Know About That Video Titled, ‘Time to Move to Russia’;;;;;;
58;;;;False;Sputnik;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-why-russia-trash-talks-us-gifted-himars-to-ukraine/6743442.html;Why Russia Trash Talks ‘U.S.-Gifted HIMARS’ Weapons in Ukraine;2022-08-04;polygraph;;"On August 1, Ukraine’s defense minister confirmed the country had received four additional M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, called HIMARS for short, from the United States.The same day, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced more arms and other aid for Ukraine valued up to $550 million, including 75,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition and an unspecified amount of HIMARS ammunition.Analysts and Ukrainian defense officials have described the HIMARS as a “game changer” in the war because the system allows Ukraine to hit targets from beyond the reach of Russian artillery. HIMARS has been used to blow up Russian ammo dumps and sever supply lines; giving the Kremlin a military and p.r. black eye.Hence a new line of disinformation from Moscow. Russia claimed in recent weeks to have destroyed six HIMARS, but the Pentagon said that claim is “patently false.”Russia also claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine used HIMARS to target a Russian-run prisoner, killing 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war. In fact, available evidence and intelligence assessments about the event suggest that Russia was itself behind the explosion, not HIMARS.Russian state media has also sought to downplay the usefulness of GPS-guided HIMARS, and to dispute their accuracy.Take this article from Russian state broadcaster RT, headlined “Ukraine is ‘shooting blind’– top official,” which falsely claimed:“The deliveries of US-made HIMARS rocket systems are 'a good first step’, but the West did not provide Kyiv with the necessary technologies to accurately hit targets, a high-ranking Ukrainian official complained.”Another article in Russian broadcaster Sputnik was headlined: “Kiev Complains Its US-Gifted HIMARS Rockets are ‘Shooting Blind’.” That false claim is based on an interview that Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs adviser, recently gave to Newsweek.When asked what additional military assistance Ukraine needed, Gerashchenko replied:“Presidential adviser Mikhail Podalyak laid out these needs last month: 2,000 troop transport vehicles, 1,000 gun-mounted vehicles, 500 tanks, 300 multiple launch rocket systems, and also the drones and communications equipment necessary to maximize the effectiveness of these systems.""HIMARS and heavy artillery are a good first step, but if we do not have the technology to find and correct targets for artillery strikes, then we're just shooting blind.” Gerashchenko pointedly did not say HIMARS are “shooting blind,” but stressed the need for technology to help Ukrainian artillery (not just HIMARS) find targets. His comments also echoed Ukraine’s persistent calls for more military hardware to help defeat Russia.Polygraph.info reached out to Gerashchenko about his comments but had not heard back from him by the time of publication.When asked how the United States is helping Ukraine “find and correct targets,” U.S. Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn told Polygraph.info the United States provides “the Ukrainians with detailed, time-sensitive information to help them understand the threats they face and defend their country against Russian aggression.”Ukrainian servicemen on armored vehicles in the city of Mykolaiv on March 28, 2022. (Nacho Doce/Reuters)That tracks with comments made by U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl in June. He said the United States will “provide the Ukrainians what they need to prosecute the targets inside Ukrainian territory.” Ukrainian officials say that includes satellite imagery (more on that below).As of July 22., U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine also included 126 155mm howitzers, 700 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, laser-guided rocket systems, Puma Unmanned Aerial Systems, 26 counter-artillery radars, four counter-mortar radars, four air surveillance radars and tactical secure communications systems.The HIMARS is a light, multiple-rocket launcher mounted on a standard U.S. Army M1140 truck frame.The HIMARS provided to Ukraine have one preloaded pod of six GPS-guided missiles with a range of up to 50 miles. The system has what the developer, Lockheed Martin, calls a “shoot and scoot capability,” meaning they can be put into position, fire, relocate and reload “in a matter of minutes,” enhancing their survivability. In Ukraine, they are doing anything but shooting blind.On July 25, Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said ""our gunners use HIMARS very precisely – they work like a surgeon with a scalpel.” Retired U.S. Army General Mark Hertling called that “a strong and accurate comment,” adding that the HIMARS version Ukraine uses has “a 200-lb. warhead, is GPS-guided, and hits what it aims at long range.”A Ukrainian military spokeswoman described July 26 HIMARS strikes on the Antonovsky bridge, near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, as “pinpoint.” She added that the damage inflicted from the strike “wasn’t vast enough” to be turned into a Russian propaganda talking point.Ukraine has targeted other bridges in the region to hinder Russian forces as Ukrainian troops battle to retake Kherson.On July 25, Ukraine claimed it had destroyed 50 Russian ammunition depots since receiving the HIMARS. Russian command-and-control posts have also been regularly targeted, arguably putting a dent in Russia’s logistics and slowing its forces’ eastern advance.The Antonivsky bridge across the Dnipro, which connects occupied Kherson with the left bank, after the initial strikes on it by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on July 20, 2022. (Sergei Bobylev/TASS)Overnight on August 2-3, HIMARS were used to strike several Russian bases and arms warehouses in the Kherson region, Newsweek reported, citing local media.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said HIMARS had become “synonymous” with the word “justice” for Ukraine. “The Ukrainian defense forces will do everything to ensure that the occupiers experience more and more painful losses every week thanks to these very effective systems,” he said.Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief, Vadym Skibitsky, recently told Britain’s Telegraph newspaper that the United States and Britain “have provided almost everything from information to equipment.”When asked how the U.S. HIMARS have so precisely targeted Russian fuel ammunition depots and battlefield headquarters, Skibitsky replied: “[I]n this case in particular, we use real-time information.”He said Washington did not provide direct targeting information, which might implicate direct U.S. participation in the war. Still, intelligence officials from both sides consulted before HIMARS strikes, he said, allowing the United States to stop a strike that officials disagree with.“I can’t tell you whether [we are directly tasking] British and American satellites, but we have very good satellite imagery,” he told The Telegraph.While Russian media reported HIMARS are firing blind, Moscow also responded to Skibitsky’s interview by accusing the United States of being Ukraine’s “gunner.”Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the real-time information and satellite data Washington provides to Ukraine “points to the direct involvement of the United States of America” in the war.";https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3112377/550-million-in-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/,https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/08/01/biden-to-send-ukraine-ammo-for-himars-as-kyiv-congress-push-for-more/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-shoigu-says-6-ukrainian-himars-systems-destroyed-interfax-2022-08-02/,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/01/us-rockets-not-used-ukraine-prison-strike-00048948,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-updates,https://www.rt.com/russia/559185-himars-deadly-weapon-ukraine/,https://www.rt.com/russia/559843-ukraine-himars-missile-target-blind/,https://sputniknews.com/20220729/kiev-complains-its-us-gifted-himars-rockets-are-shooting-blind-1097930186.html,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-07-24/ukraine-wants-game-changer-weapons-6751836.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/14/severodonetsk-weapons-nato-russian-advance/,https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jul/22/2003040788/-1/-1/1/FACT-SHEET-ON-US-SECURITY-ASSISTANCE-TO-UKRAINE.PDF,https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/mediawiki/index.php/M142_(HIMARS)_American_Artillery_Rocket_System,https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/high-mobility-artillery-rocket-system.html,https://english.nv.ua/nation/details-on-ukraine-s-pinpoint-strikes-on-key-kherson-bridge-ukraine-news-50259230.html,https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/07/22/himars-the-new-us-rocket-launchers-in-ukraine-are-making-the-russians-furious-but-can-they-win-the-war/,https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-himars-strike-russian-bases-counter-attack-kherson-artillery-1730303,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-invasion-rail-link-kherson-damaged-himars/31971622.html,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/08/01/britain-helps-ukraine-hunt-russian-spies-eyeing-western-military/,https://tass.com/russias-foreign-policy/1488185;Why Russia Trash Talks ‘U.S.-Gifted HIMARS’ Weapons in Ukraine;;;;;;

Apparently, some of our Western partners do not even want to remember these principles anymore, because it is simply embarrassing to talk about it.""It’s a misleading claim. In fact, the WTO has methods for resolving trade disputes that Russia can employ. While the Kremlin has threatened to challenge the sanctions, it hasn’t so far. There’s a reasonable case the U.S. and others are fully within their rights under WTO rules.First, some background.The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international body that regulates and facilitates trade between nations. Its main goal is ""to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible,"" says the organization's website.The WTO was established on January 1, 1995, and now comprises 164 members that account for 98 percent of world trade. It has a dispute settlement body (DSB), and the WTO’s job of settling disputes is one of its most important functions. Russia became a WTO member on August 22, 2012. Over the past five months, Russia has made several announcements saying it plans to challenge Western sanctions at the WTO.In a March 9 interview with the RIA Novosti state news agency, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, Dmitry Birichevsky, cited “unlawful trade restrictions imposed by other member countries.”Judging by official statements, Russia believes any sanctions that put it at a disadvantage in relation to other WTO members are illegal. For example, the Kremlin is very unhappy about the West's ban on the export of high-tech products to Russia - in particular, communications systems, electronics, semiconductors, aviation and space components. But what hurt the Russian economy the most was the decision of Western countries to freeze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank’s assets. On April 20, Putin instructed the government to assess the measures taken by WTO member states that restricted trade with Russia and to propose challenges by June 1.On June 15, the chairman of the Russian State Duma’s financial market committee, Anatoly Aksakov, claimed that Russia was ready to challenge the sanctions at the WTO. “This is the most legally prepared and least politicized panel of arbitrators,” he said.Nothing has happened so far, though. Here’s why.According to experts and research fellows of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, the chances are high that the WTO will recognize the sanctions as legitimate.On March 2, the United Nations General Assembly voted to demand that Russia stop its military aggression against Ukraine and immediately withdraw all troops. The resolution passed 141-5, with 35 abstentions.Thus, the international community has confirmed that Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine violated international law. Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter requires U.N. member states to refrain ""from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."" Based on this resolution, in a WTO dispute with Russia, Western countries will be able to establish that the sanctions were taken ""in time of war or other emergency in international relations.""Provisions in the WTO’s 1994 general agreement on trade allow WTO members to “justify actions taken in violation of WTO obligations” under a “security exception.”The 1994 provisions state that “[n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed … to prevent any [WTO member] from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests … taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations.” Ironically, Russia used this “security exception” to its benefit after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and instigated a war in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine went to the WTO in 2016 to dispute restrictions that Russia had imposed on Ukrainian goods transported by road and rail through Russia to third countries.Ukraine argued that the measures appeared to be inconsistent with Russia’s obligations under Article V of GATT 1994 and its commitments under its Accession Protocol. (GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was the WTO’s predecessor.)A WTO panel ruled that Russia’s actions were justified under the security exception.While it’s hard to know what specific arguments Russia will make at the WTO, it’s clear from the group’s rules and at least one recent decision that sanctions during a war can be upheld.Putin’s claim that the WTO’s procedures were “ thrown on the scrap heap” are, at a minimum, exaggerated.";https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220801-sanctions-have-huge-toll-on-russian-economy-report,https://smotrim.ru/article/2701013,https://ria.ru/20220422/sanktsii-1784956018.html,http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68836,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69089,https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_e.htm,https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/thewto_e.htm,https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres12_e/pr668_e.htm,https://ria.ru/20220309/sanktsii-1777152842.html,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/01/03/2022/621e413e9a794718fb1fe3ac,https://www.rbc.ru/economics/30/04/2022/626c4e829a7947237e834e77,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-reserves/sanctions-have-frozen-around-300-bln-of-russian-reserves-finmin-says-idUSL5N2VG0BU,http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/assignments/orders/68449,https://rtvi.com/news/v-gosdume-oczenili-shansy-rossii-osporit-defolt/,https://www.biicl.org/blog/39/economic-sanctions-against-russia-and-their-compatibility-with-wto-law-questions-and-answers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/unga-resolution-against-ukraine-invasion-full-text,https://legal.un.org/repertory/art2.shtml,https://www.bennettjones.com/Blogs-Section/Russia-Will-Challenge-Economic-Sanctions-at-the-WTO,https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/gatt_ai_e/art21_e.pdf,https://www.wita.org/atp-research/the-wto-panel-report/,https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds512_e.htm,https://www.csis.org/analysis/wtos-first-ruling-national-security-what-does-it-mean-united-states,https://www.state.gov/osce-releases-the-second-expert-mission-report-on-human-rights-abuses-and-international-humanitarian-law-violations-in-russias-war-against-ukraine/,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1761;Putin’s Misleading Gripe About Sanctions and Trade Rules;;;;;;

In the name of fighting terrorism, the Xinjiang government unleashed measures that critics say included mass surveillance and detention, destruction of mosques, “re-education,” sterilization and forced labor. The United States, other Western countries and human rights groups have called China’s policies in Xinjiang as “genocide” and “crimes against humanity.”Regarding Xi’s latest trip, the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP) noted in an editorial that the United States on June 21 imposed a new trade ban on goods made with forced labor in Xinjiang.“The [trade ban] has been taken without evidence being provided,” the editorial said.That is false.The United Nations defines forced labor as “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of a penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.”Researchers and news reports have compiled rich and duplicative evidence that China uses Uyghurs and other Muslims as forced labor to produce a wide range of goods. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, published a report on the subject in June 2022, drawing on Chinese planning documents and internal speeches and papers.China began to expand its coercive labor practices in Xinjiang in 2016-2017 under the guise of anti-poverty efforts targeting rural surplus laborers, Zenz wrote:“In January 2018, the government then initiated a special plan to transfer laborers from poor counties in southern Xinjiang to other regions … Imitating language from the concurrent mass internment campaign, the plan mandated to ‘train all who should be trained’. “Between 2016 and 2020, Xinjiang had planned to annually transfer 2.2 million rural surplus laborers. It exceeded this goal by over 30 percent, transferring 2.87 million workers per year. In 2021, the region set a record by transferring a staggering 3.2 million surplus laborers, 15.4 percent more than planned.”“Rural surplus laborers who refuse state-mandated labor transfer placements remain at risk of penalization through internment in re-education camps,” Zenz wrote. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) conservatively estimated in March 2020 that “more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019” via 35 documented labor transfer programs.The estimate was based on Chinese state media reports and public Chinese government notices.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported in November 2019 that the Xinjiang government had transferred 100,000 “poverty-stricken” surplus laborers out of Xinjiang between 2018 and 2020.The Australian report, using “open-source Chinese-language documents, satellite imagery analysis, academic research and on-the-ground media reporting,” also identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces that used Uyghur laborers transferred from Xinjiang. Based on “published supplier lists, media reports, and the factories’ claimed suppliers,” the report identified 82 global brands that “potentially directly or indirectly benefit[ed] from the use of Uyghur workers.”In February 2020, The Washington Post reported on forced labor of Uyghurs at Qingdao Taekwang Shoes Co., a Nike supplier for more than three decades.“We can walk around, but we can’t go back [to Xinjiang] on our own,” the Post quoted a Uyghur woman saying near the factory gate. The story continued:“When their shifts end, the Uyghur workers — almost all women in their 20s or younger – use hand gestures and rudimentary Mandarin to buy dried fruit, socks and sanitary pads at the stalls. Then they walk around the corner, past the factory’s police station – adorned with Uyghur writing telling them to ‘stay loyal to the party’ and ‘have clear-cut discipline’ – to dormitories where they live under constant supervision.”“Everyone knows they didn’t come here of their own free will. They were brought here,” a local fruit-seller near the factory told the Post. “The Uyghurs had to come because they didn’t have an option. The government sent them here.” The Post also reported that the Uyghur workers’ “ideology and behavior are closely monitored” inside the factory and “the facility resembles a prison.”“There are watchtowers with cameras pointed in all directions and barbed-wire fences atop the walls,” the Post reported. “There is a special police station equipped with facial-recognition cameras and other high-tech surveillance that workers must pass through when they enter and exit the factory.”The Taekwang factory is only one of the Chinese suppliers that reportedly has used Uyghur laborers under similar conditions.The Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice at Britain’s Sheffield Hallam University conducted a study on how Uyghur forced labor was used in the global solar panel supply chain.The report said that “significant evidence – largely drawn from government and corporate sources – reveals that labor transfers are deployed in the Uyghur Region within an environment of unprecedented coercion.""“Many indigenous workers are unable to refuse or walk away from these jobs, and thus the programs are tantamount to forcible transfer of populations and enslavement,” the report noted, adding that Uyghur workers were under “the constant threat of re-education and internment.”The U.S. Congress adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) with overwhelming bipartisan support last year. It was signed into law by President Joe Biden on December 23 and went into effect last month.Under the law, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency enforces a “rebuttable presumption” that “any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part” in Xinjiang are products of forced labor and barred from entry into the United States unless proven otherwise by “clear and convincing evidence.” The law lists cotton, tomatoes, apparel and polysilicon, a key ingredient in solar panels, as sectors of “high priority for enforcement.” Trade experts said that products of thousands of global companies could be blocked by the CBP due to links to Xinjiang. Fashion, electric vehicles and renewal energy projects are among the most affected sectors.The Biden administration stated that the United States would rally its “allies and partners to make global supply chains free from the use of forced labor.”";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-leaked-xinjiang-police-files-not-lies-and-rumors/31868453.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_us-classifies-chinas-policies-toward-uighurs-genocide/6200931.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_human-rights-watch-calls-out-chinas-crimes-against-humanity-toward-uyghurs/6204778.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-begins-enforcement-of-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act/6625593.html,https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/definition/lang--en/index.htm,https://jamestown.org/program/unemployment-monitoring-and-early-warning-new-trends-in-xinjiangs-coercive-labor-placement-systems/,https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale,http://sannong.cctv.com/2019/11/04/ARTIDY3f1nyxUOjkU4XoEBFw191104.shtml,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-compels-uighurs-to-work-in-shoe-factory-that-supplies-nike/2020/02/28/ebddf5f4-57b2-11ea-8efd-0f904bdd8057_story.html,https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ad360ffab-40cc-4d83-8b8b-a8bd503286a3#pageNum=3,https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA,https://www.state.gov/implementation-of-the-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act/;Plenty of Evidence Justifies U.S. Trade Ban for Forced Uyghur Labor;;;;;;

And according to news reports citing U.S. military sources, training on how to use the HIMARS launchers is taking place at undisclosed locations outside Ukraine.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on July 20 that about 200 Ukrainians had been trained to service the HIMARS, which stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. The launchers are mounted on a heavy truck for transport. In less than a month, these U.S. systems destroyed dozens of ammunition depots, military headquarters and Russian military equipment, according to multiple news reports citing military sources. The BBC’s Russian Service reported that HIMARS took out 14 ammo dumps in June.“HIMARS have hardly had any rest during the day or at night. Their potential has been used to the maximum,” Oleh Zhdanov, a former member of the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff, told The Associated Press. “The results have been impressive. Over 30 important Russian targets have been hit with high precision over the past two weeks.” As to being “forced” to defend itself, the fact is that Ukraine has been pleading for more sophisticated weapons and ammunition from the West since the onset of Russia’s invasion.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly complained that the West has been too slow in providing heavy weapons and that quantities have been insufficient.In December 2021, Germany refused to supply Ukraine with anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems, arguing they could provoke Russia. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov responded: “Not provoking Russia — that strategy does not work and will not work.”And Ukraine has been thankful. On April 13, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba confirmed that Ukraine had asked the U.K. to hurry weapon shipments. “Grateful to the UK for its leadership in increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. Underscored the importance of speeding up arms deliveries to Ukraine,” Kuleba tweeted.No arm twisting there.Most recently, on July 20, Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska addressed the U.S. Congress and asked for military assistance. “I am asking for something now I would never want to ask. I am asking for weapons,” she said. “Weapons that would not be used to wage a war on somebody else’s land but to protect one’s home and the right to wake up alive in that home.” Lavrov misleads when it comes to negotiations. Kyiv refused to negotiate with Moscow because Russia proposed conditions Ukraine found unacceptable, not because the West is preventing a deal.During a March 4 telephone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to conclude a peace agreement with Ukraine “on condition that all Russian demands are met,” the Kremlin website reported.Those “demands” included “the neutral and nuclear-free status of Ukraine with the mandatory demilitarization of the country, as well as the denazification of the Ukrainian state, recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, the sovereignty of the DNR [Donetsk People’s Republic] and LNR [Luhansk People’s Republic] within the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.”The DNR and LNR are the two puppet governments that Moscow has recognized in Ukraine’s Donbas. Like Crimea, they are part of Ukraine. Russia's claims that Ukraine needs to be ""de-nazified"" have been repeatedly debunked by Polygraph.info and others.Most Ukrainians oppose territorial concessions to Russia. In a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in mid-May, 82 percent of the respondents objected to ceding any territory to Russia, even if it meant a longer war.In another poll, conducted in Ukraine last month by NORC at the University for The Wall Street Journal, 89% of the respondents said they would not accept any peace deal with Russia that would give Russia “control over some parts of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia.” In May, the Ukrainian government ended talks with Moscow. “Russia should sit at the negotiating table after [its] defeat on the battlefield,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on July 18. “Otherwise, it will again be the language of ultimatums.”";https://defence-blog.com/us-begins-training-ukrainians-on-himars-rocket-artillery-systems/,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-send-four-more-himars-ukraine-pentagon-chief-2022-07-20/,https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/13/ukraine-himars-ammunition-russia-us/,https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3095394/us-provided-himars-effective-in-ukraine/,https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-62086287,https://fakty.ua/ru/402794-v-ofise-prezidenta-est-lyudi-kotorye-gotovy-i-hotyat-pojti-na-kompromiss-s-rossiej---voennyj-ekspert-oleg-zhdanov,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-nato-sergey-lavrov-dd7bc9324e465a15209940c146a859b3,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-gets-weapons-west-says-it-needs-more-2022-01-25/,https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-asks-germany-for-defensive-weapons-amid-russia-standoff/a-60667885,https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-countries-urged-to-supply-more-weapons-to-ukraine/6403496.html,https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1514234619201310732?s=20&t=rmD25IHZLzfvMs9yAg4Spg,https://www.c-span.org/video/?521836-1/ukraines-lady-olena-zelenska-appeals-congress-weapons,https://nypost.com/2022/07/20/ukraines-first-lady-olena-zelenska-to-address-us-congress/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-official-calls-italian-peace-plan-ukraine-fantasy-2022-05-25/,https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5240923,https://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67907,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html,https://voxukraine.org/en/a-review-of-pro-russian-narratives-in-the-german-and-italian-media-about-nazis-and-neo-nationalists-in-ukraine/,https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1111&page=1,https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJ_NORC_Ukraine_Poll_June_2022.pdf,https://www.nur.kz/world/1969747-peregovory-ukrainy-i-rossii-priostanovleny-podtverdili-v-ofise-zelenskogo/,https://forbes.ua/ru/inside/status-mirnikh-peregovoriv-z-rosieyu-tse-udar-po-vinnitsi-udari-po-mikolaevu-intervyu-dmitra-kulebi-18072022-7211;Russia’s Lavrov Spreads Phony Claim About Western Rockets in Ukraine;;;;;;

It was Putin’s first visit outside the former-Soviet sphere since Russia’s February 24 all-out invasion of Ukraine.Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Tehran on July 19, 2022. (IRNA)Putin’s visit came amid reports that Iran may supply Russia with hundreds of drones, including “weapons-capable” drones for use in the Ukraine war.Khamenei threw his support behind Putin, falsely framing Russia’s war as a preventative strike to contain the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).“#NATO is a dangerous entity. The West is totally opposed to a strong, independent Russia. If the way is opened for NATO, it will recognize no limits. If it hadn’t been stopped in #Ukraine, it would have later started a similar war in #Crimea,” a tweet from Khamenei read.That language mirrors Putin’s own false claims that the West wants to destroy Russia, even as Russia carries out an actual campaign to destroy Ukraine.There is no evidence to support the claim that NATO, a defensive alliance, sought war with Russia.Even after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO largely pursued de-escalation with Moscow, although talk of Ukraine joining NATO picked up after Russia launched and carried out a proxy war in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine first sought a Membership Action Plan (MAP) – the formalized accession process to join NATO – in 2008. However, according to NATO, “participation in the MAP does not prejudge any decision by the Alliance on future membership.”Qualifications for joining NATO include “a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; fair treatment of minority populations; a commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully; an ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and a commitment to democratic civil-military relations and institutions.” All 30 NATO members must endorse admission of a new member. At NATO's 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, the alliance decided not to offer Ukraine a MAP but did agree that Ukraine could eventually become a NATO member. Still, without a MAP there was no concrete path for Ukraine to actually join the alliance.In May 2010, Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, officially dropped Ukraine’s pursuit of NATO membership. The following month, Ukraine’s parliament passed a law affirming its status as a military non-aligned country – a move that prevented NATO membership.According to the Pew Research Center, that ban against joining NATO did not come “without a base of public support.” The previous year, a survey by the center’s Global Attitudes Project found that about half of Ukrainians (51%) opposed joining NATO and only 21% supported it.Yanukovych was ousted in early 2014 after protests, then came the Russian invasions. Under attack, Ukraine passed legislation scrapping the non-aligned status, stating that it had “proved to be ineffective in guaranteeing Ukraine's security and protecting the country from external aggression and pressure.” The legislation also expressed Ukraine’s desire to meet “the criteria which are required for membership in the [NATO] alliance.”By invading Crimea and Donbas in 2014, Russia flagrantly violated its commitments under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, a post-Soviet diplomatic agreement, to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear arsenal.In June 2017, Ukraine’s parliament passed additional legislation “reinstating membership in NATO as a strategic foreign and security policy objective.”Under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine approved a National Security Strategy in September 2020 that provided for the development of a “distinctive partnership with NATO with the aim of membership in NATO.”President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy (on screen) during a video address at the NATO summit in Madrid, Spain, on June 29, 2022. (Manu Fernandez/Associated Press)Still, despite increased support and cooperation, NATO never offered Ukraine a MAP.In June 2021, U.S. Republican Sen. Rob Portman argued that giving Ukraine and Georgia (another neighbor that Russia invaded in 2008) a formal path to NATO membership could have prevented war.“I understand NATO's concern about the prospect of integrating with a country where there is an ongoing conflict. But, frankly, if Ukraine and Georgia had received the MAP in 2008, I don't think there would have been a conflict at all,” Portman told Radio Free Europe, a sister U.S.-funded news organization to the Voice of America.Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the United States, European Union and other allies adopted targeted sanctions against some Russian individuals and businesses. NATO also broke off “practical cooperation” with Russia, although it “kept channels for communication with Russia open.”NATO also began deploying, “on a rotating basis, relatively small multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington, D.C.He noted that “from 1997 to 2014, NATO deployed virtually no troops or equipment in new member states.”Writing the same day that Russia officially annexed Crimea, Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-19, said the United States “studiously” avoided “any suggestions of military response to Putin’s military aggression.”Street art in Kharkiv shows Ukraine's attitude toward Russia's occupation of Crimea peninsula on July 7, 2022. (Cara Anna/Associated Press)Volker said allies sought to prevent NATO from taking action to “avoid ‘escalating’ the crisis.” That, Volker argued, would embolden Putin, who viewed the acquisition of territory as permanent.“As Russia gobbles up territory and conducts major exercises on the borders of the Baltic States and Ukraine, the United States talks about off-ramps, Washington and Brussels lumber toward phased, underwhelming sanctions, and NATO cuts back on cooperative activities,” Volker wrote.“NATO seems to be stuck operating in the logic of partnership, rather than the logic of defense and deterrence.”Volker said that NATO deterrence was necessary ""to prevent further Russian incursions into Ukraine and other areas of Eastern Europe.""None of his suggestions would have placed “U.S. or NATO ground troops in Ukraine.” He noted that Germany, a NATO member, “sought to minimize NATO’s military engagement, political role, and any push-back on Russia.”Germany “aggressively” pushed ahead with the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which bypassed Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, up to the eve of Russia’s 2022 invasion. The pipeline would have doubled Russian gas exports to Germany.There is no evidence NATO has ever considered military action against Russia. There is abundant evidence that Russia’s war aims are imperial.In a speech last month, Putin compared himself to the Russian Tsar Peter the Great, “equating Russia's invasion of Ukraine today with Peter's expansionist wars some three centuries ago and making his strongest acknowledgment yet that his own war is a land grab,” the BBC reported.In July 2021, Putin gave a speech in which he called modern Ukraine the brainchild of the Soviets, adding: “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia.”Putin reiterated that point on the eve of the invasion, after he recognized the independence of two Russian-controlled breakaway ""republics"" in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which is now the focal point for Russia’s war. “So, I'll start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely and completely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Putin said in a February 21 speech.Russia falsely claims it is halting genocide in eastern Ukraine, and that claim was recently further undermined by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who signaled that Russia’s expansionist goals were extending to southern Ukraine.“Now the geography has changed. It's not just Donetsk and Luhansk (in eastern Donbas), it's Kherson, Zaporizhia, and several other territories. And this is an ongoing process, consistent and insistent,” Lavrov said. On February 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Maria Popova and Oxana Shevel argued in a piece published by Just Security, an online analytical forum, that the invasion was “essentially not about NATO.”“The larger objective is to re-establish Russian political and cultural dominance over a nation that Putin sees as one with Russia, and then follow up by undoing the European rules-based order and security architecture established in the aftermath of World War II,” they wrote.“Given these goals, Ukrainian neutrality is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin.”Pundits on Russian state media have appeared to promote genocide, denying Ukraine’s right to exist and comparing Ukrainians to “worms” that need to be removed. Modern Russia’s eliminationist rhetoric against Ukraine goes back more than a decade. In May, more than 30 independent analysts said Russia was responsible for inciting genocide in Ukraine, The Washington Post reported.On July 20, members of the U.S. Senate introduced legislation “recognizing Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a genocide.”The senators accused Russia of “killing Ukrainian civilians en masse,” indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure, “heinous acts of sexual violence and forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia,” and “trying to eliminate the Ukrainian language, Ukrainian history and Ukrainian culture.”";https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/politics/russian-visit-iran-weapons-capable-drones/index.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-drones-russia-ukraine-war/31943572.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-syria-iran-289c3422c8980e7650dbde2c326d248a,https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1549467361975193600,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-says-the-west-wants-to-destroy-russia-but-that-ignores-history-/31769158.html,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37356.htm,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_8443.htm,https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/ukraine-makes-it-official-nation-will-abandon-plan-67901.html,https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/03/29/ukraine-says-no-to-nato/,https://www.bbc.com/news/10229626,https://www.derechos.org/peace/russia/doc/ukr2229.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-kremlin-has-flagrantly-broken-budapest-pact-on-ukraine-s-security/31619630.html,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37750.htm,https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-ukraina-gruzia-nato/31288387.html,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111767.htm,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/12/21/russias-draft-agreements-with-nato-and-the-united-states-intended-for-rejection/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/18/wheres-natos-strong-response-to-russias-invasion-of-crimea/,https://www.voanews.com/a/explainer-what-is-the-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-/6454322.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61767191,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-ukraine-history/31719136.html,https://www.justsecurity.org/80343/russias-new-assault-on-ukraine-is-not-entirely-maybe-not-even-largely-about-nato/,https://www.justsecurity.org/81789/russias-eliminationist-rhetoric-against-ukraine-a-collection/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/27/genocide-ukraine-russia-analysis/,https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/risch-cardin-colleagues-introduce-resolution-recognizing-russias-actions-in-ukraine-as-a-genocide;Iran Concocts NATO War Fantasy To Justify Russia’s Ukraine Invasion;;;;;;

It’s Bogus;2022-07-21;polygraph;;"On July 20, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Canada of sabotaging Gazprom’s ability to supply Europe with gas.Putin speculated that Canada wants to sell its own gas and oil to Europe, and implied that Western economic sanctions imposed because of the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine hindered Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian energy behemoth.At the Agency for Strategic Initiatives forum in Moscow, Putin spoke about a turbine being repaired in Canada. Such turbines are used to push natural gas through pipelines for delivery.Putin said: “One machine needs planned repairs; it is not given back from Canada because sanctions have been placed against Gazprom, although it is a Siemens (a German company) plant.“I'll tell you why Canada did it: because it produces oil and gas itself and plans to enter the European market.""The claim is false. Canada did send the repaired turbine back to Germany, and had earlier exempted Gazprom’s partner, Siemens Energy, from sanctions for two years.U.S. and European officials have accused Russia of using energy as a weapon in its war against Ukraine. Before its February invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas. EU officials have asked member countries to reduce usage 15 percent and fear that Russia, which has already reduced flows, will cut the gas off entirely.Enter the turbine controversy, which involves the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the North Sea through which Russia’s gas flows.On July 13, The Globe and Mail news agency reported, citing state officials, that Canada granted Siemens Energy a two-year exemption from sanctions the country imposed over the war in Ukraine.The exemption was to allow Siemens to repair six Nord Stream 1 turbines at the company’s facility in Montreal and to return them to Russia, the Globe and Mail reported.Canada had announced on July 11 that it would be returning one repaired turbine to Germany. The United States stated its support of Canada’s decision in a same-day statement.“[W]e support the Canadian government’s decision to return a natural gas turbine to Germany for use in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline,” U.S State Department spokesman Ned Price said.“In the short term, the turbine will allow Germany and other European countries to replenish their gas reserves, increasing their energy security and resiliency and countering Russia’s efforts to weaponize energy.”Still, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had criticized the Canadian exemption as “absolutely unacceptable.”“Russia deliberately does this blackmailing with gas and provoking violations of sanctions,” he said in a July 17 video.CNN Business and other news agencies reported on July 21 that Gazprom had resumed gas shipments through Nord Stream 1.Given Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and oil, Gazprom has not been targeted directly in the United States-European Union sanctions for the war. Under Directives 3 and 4, the U.S. restrictions are limited to Gazprom’s financial operations with certain Russian banks, which are under sanctions.Moreover, Gazprom owns its own bank, the third-largest in Russia, which also avoided sanctions. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Ukrainian team Schemes reported in July that the Russian military uses Gazprombank to pay salary and combat wages to troops deployed to the war in Ukraine.(RFE/RL is a U.S. funded sister news organization to VOA.)In his July 20 remarks, Putin expressed doubt about the quality of repairs to the turbine and suggested that Canada might intentionally sabotage Nord Steam 1. “Maybe they will turn it off at some point, and that’s it, and Nord Stream 1 will stop, because they came from there, from Canada,” Putin said.On June 14, Gazprom informed Germany that it will be reducing gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 from planned 167 million to 100 million cubic meters a day. The next day, Gazprom reduced the volume of gas to 67 million cubic meters, citing delay in returning the repaired turbine from Canada.Since early 2021, Russia has been gradually reducing natural gas supplies to Europe, causing prices to surge. Prices have more than doubled from their pre-invasion levels in February.";https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/07/20/canada-a78360,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69039,https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/us-blame-russia-for-manipulating-europe-gas-prices-moscow-retorts-the-eu-messed-it-up/,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/vladimir-putin-accused-of-weaponizing-russian-gas/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canadas-deal-to-allow-repair-of-sanctioned-russian-turbines-covers/,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/five-things-to-know-about-the-turbines-causing-friction-between-canada-and-ukraine/ar-AAZMboH,https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-supports-canadas-decision-to-return-turbine-to-germany/,https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/diyi-ta-bezdiyalnist-kozhnoyi-posadovoyi-osobi-v-sektori-bez-76529,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/energy/nord-stream-1-gas/index.html,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/ap-online/2022/07/21/key-gas-pipeline-from-russia-to-europe-restarts-after-break,https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=17250,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/eo13662_directive3.pdf,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/eo14024_directive_4_02282022.pdf,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-gazprombank-sanctions-funds-russia-war-soldiers-wages/31920143.html,https://www.usagm.gov/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-russias-putin-skeptical-about-the-quality-of-repaired-nord-stream-1/,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/29/06/2022/62bbde289a7947e974232285,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-has-not-been-a-reliable-energy-source-for-europe/31507546.html,https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/eu-natural-gas;Putin Tries to Blame Canada for Europe’s Gas Woes.

In fact, Putin’s approval rating in the U.S. is practically zero. Polls show that his global ratings have nose-dived since he launched the war on Ukraine.First, the tweets.Given Russia’s extensive record of social media fakery, it’s a fair chance the tweets are bogus. None of accounts use a real name or photo. They could be from anywhere, assuming they are real people. The tweet supporting Putin, from user “Topher Tuathalain,” stated: “Turns out, Putin was right about a lot of things.”The “Topher Tuathalain” account was created in February. In 165 days, this account posted 24,500 tweets – that is, 148 tweets per day. The vast majority were retweets.Such a high volume of tweeting is a red flag for bots or trolls, said Agassi Rodriguez, an analyst with Campus Sonar, which provides social media analysis for clients in higher education.Bot Sentinel, a browser extension that helps identify fake accounts, concluded that “Topher Tuathalain’s” account “exhibits disruptive tweet activity, and we recommend caution when interacting with this account.”Lest we forget, the January 2017 U.S. intelligence community report, “Assessing Russia's Activities and Intentions in the Recent U.S. Elections” identified trolls at the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg as the source of widespread interference in the presidential election.A federal grand jury issued criminal indictments against the agency and numerous alleged Russian co-conspirators, including Putin confidante Yevgeniy Prigozhin.“Using fictitious U.S. personas, Internet Research Agency employees operated social media accounts and group pages designed to attract U.S. audiences,” former Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded in his report on Russia’s activities.“These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists.”U.S. legal action hasn’t stopped the Russian trolls.In January 2021, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported that the Internet Research Agency’s work was expanding and that, to cover its tracks, it had moved several times. (RFE/RL and VOA are both U.S.-funded independent news agencies.) In April 2022, the British Foreign Office said Russia continued to operate an internet troll factory, Reuters reported. U.K.-funded research, Reuters said, had “exposed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign was designed to manipulate international public opinion of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, boost support for it and recruit new sympathizers.”The idea that a significant part of American society supports Vladimir Putin contradicts surveys.In fact, Putin has been unpopular in the United States for a long time. In 2013, Gallup asked Americans about their attitude toward him. Fifty-four percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of him, and only 19 percent had a favorable view.After Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, then launched a proxy war in Ukraine's east, U.S. public opinion about Putin worsened. The number of Americans with an unfavorable view of Putin rose to 72 percent, while his favorables plunged to 13 percent.Other polls underscore his deep unpopularity.According to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted in January 2018, a majority of Americans (68%) had “an unfavorable opinion of Russian President Vladimir Putin,” while only 16% viewed him favorably. A 2021 Pew Research Center poll showed the same result, with only 16% of Americans having confidence in Vladimir Putin. Russia's war on Ukraine has made Americans even less admiring of Putin.In a March 2022 poll for The Wall Street Journal, just 4 percent of respondents expressed a favorable view of Putin, while 90% had an unfavorable one.Also in March, a Quinnipiac University survey found that 60 percent of Americans believed Putin to be mentally unstable. Quinnipiac analyst Tim Malloy called Putin “the world’s most-reviled leader.” By comparison, 72 percent of Americans told Pew Research Center pollsters in March that they had confidence in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As Pew’s headline put it, “Zelenskyy inspires widespread confidence from U.S. public as views of Putin hit new low.”;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/07/13/john-bolton-coup/,https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1547186351593889793,https://spyscape.com/article/inside-the-troll-factory-russias-internet-research-agency,https://twitter.com/tuthalain/status/1547187392544653312,https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3Atuthalain)%20until%3A2022-02-07%20since%3A2022-02-01&src=typed_query&f=top,https://blog.campussonar.com/blog/identifying-twitter-bots-and-trolls,https://www.linkedin.com/in/agassyr/,https://www.campussonar.com/campus-sonar-services,https://botsentinel.com/,https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf,https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-47377130,https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html,https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britain-says-russian-troll-factory-is-spreading-disinformation-social-media-2022-04-30/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/russia-trolling-ukraine-traction-tiktok,https://www.svoboda.org/a/31065181.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britain-says-russian-troll-factory-is-spreading-disinformation-social-media-2022-04-30/,https://news.gallup.com/poll/204191/putin-image-rises-mostly-among-republicans.aspx,https://news.gallup.com/poll/204191/putin-image-rises-mostly-among-republicans.aspx,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/26/putin-remains-overwhelmingly-unpopular-in-the-united-states/,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/14/few-across-17-advanced-economies-have-confidence-in-putin/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/11/putin-now-among-most-hated-world-figures-recent-us-history/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-ukraine-inflation-midterms-11646975533,https://www.newsweek.com/putin-unstable-poll-russia-ukraine-war-1689069,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/30/zelenskyy-inspires-widespread-confidence-from-u-s-public-as-views-of-putin-hit-new-low/?utm_content=bufferb2189&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer;How the Kremlin Propagandized Bolton’s Remark About Planning ‘Coups’;;;;;;
65;;;;False;Multiple Russian media outlets;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-media-distort-western-reporting-on-ukraine/6743415.html;Russian Media Distort Western Reporting on Ukraine;2022-07-07;polygraph;;An article in The Telegraph has attracted the attention of the Russian media. The piece, written by the British newspaper’s senior diplomatic correspondent Roland Oliphant and published on July 5, was headlined “Ukraine needs a victory before autumn to silence Western doubters.” Its sub-headline read: “Volodymyr Zelenskyy is running out of time to shore up support, with some believing his country’s battle against Russia is futile.”Russian media reports about the Telegraph piece trended on the Yandex.ru and Rambler.ru search platforms and were featured on the front pages of Russian state-controlled media outlets.The Russian media pieces about the Telegraph article had nearly identical headlines:“Telegraph: The West will cut aid to Ukraine because of the futility of supporting Kyiv,” Gazeta.ru’s headline read. “The Telegraph: Western countries may curtail the program of support for Ukraine due to the failures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” read the headline in the state-owned Federal News Agency.“‘Western support for Ukraine is useless’,” read the headline on the Rambler.ru news site, with the sub-headline: “Telegraph: The West will cut aid to Ukraine because of the futility of supporting Kyiv.”All of those Russian media reports misquoted and distorted the piece in The Telegraph in a way that fits Kremlin anti-Ukraine propaganda, thereby misinforming Russian readers.The Kremlin’s persistent false narrative is that the West will cut support for Ukraine.Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the West has demonstrated unprecedented unity in aiding Ukraine and taking tough measures to weaken Russia’s military and economy. It has provided Ukraine with military equipment, personnel training, humanitarian aid and diplomatic support. Most recently, Western leaders promised during the June G7 Summit in Germany that they would continue to support for Ukraine. “We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” said the G7 statement signed by the leaders of the United States, U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan. According to Ukraine Support Tracker – a dataset created by the German KIEL Institute for the World Economy – the Western aid for Ukraine is increasing, not shrinking.The United States alone has committed to providing Ukraine with military, humanitarian and financial aid worth more than $42 billion.Countries with smaller economies, like Estonia and Latvia, have dedicated up to 10% of their GDP to supporting Ukraine.In his July 5 article, Telegraph senior foreign correspondent Roland Oliphant stated that recent Russian territorial gains in Ukraine have been “costly, bloody and slow” but brought Russia “almost no strategic advantage.” “Russia’s initial plans for a grand battle of encirclement in Donbas to destroy the Ukrainian army have failed,” he wrote. None of that was included in the Russian news reports that cited his piece.However, Oliphant also stated that Russian forces “are still advancing and the Ukrainians are still retreating,” adding that “[w]ith the exception Russian retreats from Kyiv in March and from Kharkiv in May, the grinding battles of attrition have ended almost entirely in Russia’s favor.”Ukraine’s recent battle-field losses and shortage of professionally trained military personnel are playing “into an even more important battle for international opinion,” Oliphant wrote, with “plenty of influential voices in Western capitals … who still believe Western support for Ukraine is futile.”“Until and unless the Ukrainian army begins to put encirclements around the Russians, the self-proclaimed realists will feel vindicated - and their calls for a cease-fire and settlement in Moscow’s favor will gain influence with governments. So, Ukraine needs a victory - and in short order,” Oliphant wrote.Indeed, Oliphant’s piece was, if anything, a call for increased Western military aid to Ukraine. He wrote that “Ukraine must win the war and the West must do all it can to help do so.” The Russian media, however, seemingly cherry-picked and mistranslated certain parts of the Telegraph piece, rearranging them in a way that better fit Moscow’s propaganda narratives.Russian media outlets regularly distort Western media reporting.In early June, Russian media outlets put their spin on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story about the situation on Ukraine’s eastern front lines and the mood of Ukrainian troops there.Ukrainian servicemen shared their despair and frustration with CBC war correspondent Neil Hauer, complaining about the lack of proper weaponry and their feeling of being abandoned under relentless Russian bombardment. The CBC piece was headlined: “‘In this war, the ordinary infantryman is nothing’: Ukrainian soldiers in Donbas feel abandoned and outgunned”. Russian media stories about the CBC were all a variation of this headline: “CBC News: servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine spoke out about the betrayal of the leadership.”In May, Polygraph.info described how Russian and Chinese media distorted a Canadian sniper’s story about the war in Ukraine.His account appeared in an article published in the Canadian newspaper La Presse under the headline “War is a terrible disappointment.” The Canadian sniper, who volunteered to fight against Russian forces in Ukraine, described the horrors and frustrations of war, including having to scrounge for food, weapons and ammunition. He also recounted an incident in which two inexperienced Ukrainian conscripts were blown up by a Russian tank.But Russia’s state-owned RT and China’s state-owned Global Times cherry-picked the La Presse account, saying it described “looting, profiteering and desertion.” They exaggerated the sniper’s more nuanced remarks, turning them into an attack on the professionalism of the Ukrainian military.“Over many years, Russia has fabricated a set of false narratives that its disinformation and propaganda ecosystem persistently injects into the global information environment,” the U.S. State Department wrote in a January 2022 fact sheet on Russian disinformation. “These narratives act like a template, which enables the Kremlin to adjust these narratives, with one consistency – a complete disregard for truth as it shapes the information environment to support its policy goals.”After launching a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in February, the Russian government criminalized independent reporting about its war there, banning and expelling independent media outlets. “These new laws are part of Russia’s ruthless effort to suppress all dissent and make sure the population does not have access to any information that contradicts the Kremlin’s narrative about the invasion of Ukraine,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch.;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/07/05/ukraine-needs-victory-autumn-silence-western-doubters/,https://yandex.ru/news/story/Telegraph_Zapad_sokratit_pomoshh_Ukraine_iz-zabessmyslennosti_podderzhki_Kieva--42c46e4b1b5d80451c1377fdfad3c45a?lang=ru&rubric=politics&fan=1&stid=VuWH5fzABDReg0hPDzqF&t=1657041024&tt=true&persistent_id=216582656&story=88adae1c-337f-58a2-b6f4-b00f7ace29e2,https://news.rambler.ru/world/48947240-zapadnaya-podderzhka-ukrainy-bespolezna/,https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2022/07/05/18070100.shtml?updated,https://riafan.ru/23521499-the_telegraph_strani_zapada_mogut_svernut_programmu_podderzhki_ukraini_iz_za_provalov_vsu,https://news.rambler.ru/world/48947240-zapadnaya-podderzhka-ukrainy-bespolezna/,http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-invasion-of-ukraine-backfired-united-west-in-unprecedented-ways-2022-2?op=1,http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/g7-we-will-stand-with-ukraine-for-as-long-as-it-takes/ar-AAYUWyO,https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/,https://app.23degrees.io/view/tAuBi41LxvWwKZex-bar-stacked-horizontal-figure-2_csv_final,https://app.23degrees.io/view/F1tc2gv8QzFCs1ij-bar-stacked-horizontal-figure_3_4_csv_v2-1,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/eastern-ukraine-bakhmut-soldiers-exhausted-1.6278984,https://yandex.ru/news/instory/CBC_voennosluzhashhie_VSU_zayavili_opredatelstve_ukrainskikh_vlastej--1f308d3221db7da867d87c2dd18b3b36 ,https://www.kp.ru/online/news/4804687/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-distorts-canadian-sniper-ukraine-tale/31848460.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-george-floyd-protests/30653379.html,https://www.state.gov/russias-top-five-persistent-disinformation-narratives/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/07/russia-criminalizes-independent-war-reporting-anti-war-protests;Russian Media Distort Western Reporting on Ukraine;;;;;;

(Vadim Braifov/TASS)Sachs‘ Madrid speech included what he called a “provocative statement” concerning the origins of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. He said (emphasis added):“I’m pretty convinced it [the COVID-19] came out of U.S. lab biotechnology, not out of nature. Just to mention, after two years of intensive work on this. So, it’s a blunder, in my view, of biotech, not an accident of a natural spillover. We don’t know for sure, I should be absolutely clear. But there’s enough evidence that it should be looked into, and it’s not being investigated, not in the United States, not anywhere. And I think for real reasons, that they don’t want to look underneath the rug too much.”  Some media outlets interpreted Sachs’ comments as follows:RT (Russia Today): “Covid-19 may have originated in US biolab – Lancet chair”Pakistan’s Express Tribune: “Covid-19 may have originated in US bio-lab, says Jeffry Sachs”India’s Republic World: “COVID-19 Leaked From US Biolab, Claims Lancet’s Commission Head; Not A Natural Spillover’”Iran’s Tasnim News Agency: “COVID-19 May Have Originated in US Bio-Lab: American Economist”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also chimed in, citing Sachs’ comments to reinforce Beijing’s repeated claims that the United States should be investigated as the source of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has provided no direct evidence, and U.S. labs have denied such claims.The wording of Sachs’ statement does create ambiguity; still, RT and the others summarized his full remarks in a misleading way that downplays the disclaimer, ""We don't know for sure, I want to be absolutely clear.""They shorthand the actual phrase “U.S. lab biotechnology” to instead mean a “U.S. biolab.” And Sachs did not say the coronavirus ""leaked"" from a U.S. lab.In more extensive commentaries published in May, however, he and a co-author had speculated that the virus may have resulted from a U.S.-China research partnership involving the National Institutes of Health, a biolab at the University of North Carolina, and labs in Wuhan, China.The pair argued that an independent, thorough investigation should be launched by U.S. authorities, but again there were important disclaimers.""We do not assert that laboratory manipulation was involved in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, although it is apparent that it could have been,"" he and co-author Neil Harrison wrote on May 19 in a commentary for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""However, we do assert that there has been no independent and transparent scientific scrutiny to date of the full scope of the U.S.-based evidence.""Sachs did not respond a Polygraph.info request to clarify his statement in Madrid.Sachs and Harrison, a Columbia University professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology, also co-authored a shorter opinion piece for The Boston Globe newspaper titled, “Questions surrounding the origins of COVID-19 remain unanswered,” published on May 31. In that piece, also carefully worded, they said “[t]he origins of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown but may have had an assist from advanced U.S. biotechnology.”Their concerns center on the contentious issue of ""gain-of-function"" research, an approach that involves altering the qualities of a virus to gauge its potential for causing widespread disease. Gain-of-function studies aim to discover threatening pathogens in advance to prevent widespread disease.The United States funded research on bat coronaviruses with science partners in Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 was first detected in late 2019.In their Globe commentary, Sachs and Harrison focused attention on a specific genetic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that “enhances the ability of the virus to enter and infect human cells,” questioning whether that feature evolved naturally or was “put into the virus by a laboratory manipulation.”They stated that inserting this feature, called a ""furin cleavage site,"" into viruses for experimentation had been ""an aim of a U.S.-China research team, using biotechnology developed by U.S. scientists.”Sachs and Harrison then discuss Project DEFUSE, a 2018 grant proposal to test engineered bat coronaviruses in humanized mice and measure their capacity to cause disease. A second part proposed testing ways to suppress bats in rural China from shedding potentially harmful viruses.“Much of this work was to be carried out in a Wuhan laboratory with a low level of biosafety control,” Sachs and Harrison wrote in the Globe. Partners included the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a prominent research lab at the University of North Carolina.Project DEFUSE was submitted for a $14 million grant to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) but rejected. Still, Sachs and Harrison suggest the work may have been “undertaken anyway.”“We have no idea, but it is standard procedure to carry out preliminary work, or even a whole project, whether or not a particular grant is accepted. And in truth, the DEFUSE proposal is part of a much larger, and still hidden, research agenda overseen by the NIH,” they said.“What work did NIH, DOD [Department of Defense], and other U.S. agencies fund that might have contributed to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2?” they wrote. ""Let’s open the books and get the facts from US organizations to see what light they can shed on the origin of this tragic global disaster.""Argument over whether COVID-19 leaked from a laboratory or arose naturally from animals is ongoing, as Polygraph.info and others have reported. But given Sachs' prominence leading the Lancet committee, the commentaries further riled the debate among researchers.In September 2021, Sachs had dissolved the Lancet COVID-19 Commission’s origin task force over potential conflicts of interest of some of its members stemming from their connection to the WIV, Science magazine reported.Among those members was Peter Daszak, an expert on disease ecology who runs the EcoHealth Alliance and whom Sachs had chosen to head the task force. The EcoHealth Alliance gave $600,000 in U.S. government funding to the WIV to study coronaviruses in bats. Daszak's alliance had also submitted the Project DEFUSE grant proposal. In February 2016, Daszak discussed how he and his colleagues in China carried out research involving bats that arguably fell under the gain-of-function umbrella.Daszak has been instrumental in arguing against the lab-origin theory. In February 2020, The Lancet published a statement by a group of health scientists “strongly condemn[ing] conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.”The nonprofit group U.S. Right to Know published letters in November 2020 showing that Daszak had drafted the Lancet statement and worked to get other scientists to sign it. Three of the signatories had a change of heart, saying the lab-origin hypothesis deserved consideration.Daszak also was a member of a controversial World Health Organization (WHO) fact-finding mission that went to Wuhan in early 2021 to investigate the pandemic’s origins.The New York Times reported in February 2021 that some WHO team members claimed China had refused to hand over important data during that investigation. Daszak disputed the Times report, although the WHO chief also said data had been withheld from WHO investigators.Critics have accused the outspoken Sachs of being a China apologist.In 2018, Sachs wrote an article titled, “The U.S., not China, is the real threat to international rule of law” following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.In April 2021, Sachs also co-authored an article titled, “The Xinjiang Genocide Allegations are Unjustified.” The piece argues that while credible human rights abuses have been reported against the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang province, they may not add up to genocide under international law.During his Gate Center talk in Madrid, Sachs was highly critical of the United States. Sachs also blamed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on NATO expansion, a talking point echoed by China.Some of Polygraph.info's previous fact checks about China and false or misleading claims about origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be found here.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7347338/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7347338/,https://www.rt.com/news/558191-economist-says-covid-escaped-us-lab/,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2364331/covid-19-may-have-originated-in-us-bio-lab-says-jeffry-sachs,https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-news/covid-19-leaked-from-us-biolab-claims-lancets-commission-head-not-a-natural-spillover-articleshow.html,https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2022/07/03/2737889/covid-19-may-have-originated-in-us-bio-lab-american-economist,https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119,https://www.jeffsachs.org/newspaper-articles/d9jdb25tf2ahfdtxhwl5r9jwawy5r9,https://www.science.org/content/article/we-ve-done-nothing-wrong-ecohealth-leader-fights-charges-his-research-helped-spark-covid-19,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21066966-defuse-proposal,https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/26/1030043/gain-of-function-research-coronavirus-ralph-baric-vaccines/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-coronavirus-lab-no-evidence/31301331.html,https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1532041494307016704,https://www.science.org/content/article/fights-over-confidentiality-pledge-and-conflicts-interest-tore-apart-covid-19-origin-probe,https://www.c-span.org/video/?404875-1/pandemics,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext,https://usrtk.org/biohazards-blog/ecohealth-alliance-orchestrated-key-scientists-statement-on-natural-origin-of-sars-cov-2/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/wuhan-lab-leak-question-chinese-mine-covid-pandemic-11621871125,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/world/asia/china-world-health-organization-coronavirus.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-china-report/data-withheld-from-who-team-probing-covid-19-origins-in-china-tedros-idUSKBN2BM26S,https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/jeffrey-sachs-on-the-catastrophic-american-response-to-the-coronavirus,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-us-not-china-is-the-real-threat-to-international-rule-of-law/,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/biden-should-withdraw-unjustified-xinjiang-genocide-allegation-by-jeffrey-d-sachs-and-william-schabas-2021-04?barrier=accesspaylog,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=china%20biolab&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10;Russia, China Hype Speculation About Coronavirus Lab Origin in U.S.;;;;;;

Not Really;2022-07-05;polygraph;;On June 21, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari told Bloomberg News that Nigeria has progressed on all levels during his presidency. Buhari’s statements came near the end of his second and final term, with the country set to elect a new leader next year. Buhari touted his administration’s efforts to fight corruption and eliminate citizen fears of reporting economic mismanagement. He claimed to improve the economy, accelerate development and take back areas of the country controlled by extremists.“We leave Nigeria in a far better place than we found it,” Buhari said.That is misleading. Although Buhari initiated anti-corruption and counter-insurgency actions and worked to better the economy, Nigeria's long-festering problems remain.Fighting corruption was a pillar of Buhari’s 2015 presidential campaign. But a 2019 United Nations survey blamed ongoing corruption for continued poverty and blocking economic development.While citing a modest reduction in bribery, the survey still found that 30 percent of Nigerians had paid at least one bribe in the prior year, overwhelmingly to public officials. And one in five were offered a bribe for their vote in the previous election, the survey found.Nigeria ranked 154 out of 180 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index in 2021, its worst ranking during Buhari’s tenure.In 2021, the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD) reported that Buhari did champion anti-corruption programs and empower anti-corruption agencies, allowing the prosecution of some high-level officials. But the center said that wasn’t enough, blaming “an enforcement-based strategy rather than pushing for deeper political and institutional reforms.” “He has turned a blind eye to allegations of corruption directed toward his inner circle and prominent ruling party figures, and his cabinet includes several individuals tainted by accusations of corruption,” the CDD said. “Buhari’s government has also increased the use of corruption-prone slush funds known as ‘security votes’.” The 2021 Pandora Papers leak of secret offshore financial documents revealed that more than 100 Nigerian officials and business owners poured money into buying properties in London using secret offshore accounts.Some of the named officials in the documents officials in Buhari’s government, including Kebbi State Gov. Atiku Bagudu and Labour Party member Peter Obi, who will be running in Nigeria’s 2023 presidential elections. But the government did little to follow up on the leaked documents, the Daily Trust Nigeria news reported. In response Obi declared that these accusations are false and that he “did not break any law.” Bagudu'a lawyer said his client's dealings were lawful.Inflation in Nigeria reached 18% in May, while in 2015, the year Buhari was elected, inflation hovered at around 9%. Food inflation rose to 20% in May, partly due to the Russian war on Ukraine, which has helped drive up the prices of bread and cereals.According to World Bank, four in 10 Nigerians live below the national poverty line and lack access to education and basic infrastructure. The World Poverty Clock estimates that 39% of Nigerians – some 83 million – live in extreme poverty.Developing the country’s infrastructure has been a pillar of Buhari’s administration. However, funding remains a major challenge, especially following the oil price crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. About 9 percent of Nigeria’s economy depends on oil. The country’s total public debt grew to $93 billion in 2021, up 18% from 2020, Reuters reported. Nigeria experienced two recessions under Buhari’s leadership. The first came in 2016, when oil prices fell, according to the Abuja news outlet Premium Times, which said Buhari’s government failed to “initiate an economic roadmap and constitute a cabinet for the economic recession.” Since 2011, Boko Haram, Africa’s largest Islamist militant group, has carried out attacks in Nigeria. In 2015, the group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group. Buhari vowed to combat the expansion of extremist groups. Boko Haram initially suffered a series of defeats and today is mostly contained in some villages and pockets in Nigeria’s Muslim north.But the security threats in Nigeria have not subsided. According to the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), a project of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Africa program, more than 2,000 people were killed between January and March 2022, while 1,484 were abducted. Local bandits have continued to kill and abduct people in Nigeria since 2017, with kidnapping for ransom becoming a lucrative business. “These assailants have attacked rural dwellers, destroyed their farmlands and in many cases only allow them to the farm after they have paid protection fees. They have also targeted travelers across the region,” the Premium Times reported.Read Buhari's full interview with Bloomberg News here.;https://www.ned.org/nigeria-prepares-for-the-2023-elections/,https://www.africanews.com/2019/10/03/nigeria-presidency-says-buhari-will-not-seek-unconstitutional-3rd-term//,https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/corruption/nigeria/Corruption_in_Nigeria_2019_standard_res_11MB.pdf,https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021,https://www.cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CDD-Anti-corruption-1.pdf,https://www.dw.com/en/nigerias-hopeless-fight-against-corruption/a-61946896,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/492437-pandora-papers-inside-the-secret-assets-of-a-nigerian-lawmaker-and-how-he-serially-broke-the-law.html,https://www.transparency.org/en/news/pandora-papers-10-countries-investigations-policy-reforms,https://www.financeuncovered.org/stories/pandora-papers-nigeria-offshore-london-properties,https://dailytrust.com/corruption-leaks-pressure-mounts-on-buhari-to-probe-bagudu-obi-others,https://nairametrics.com/2021/10/11/pandora-papers-i-did-not-break-the-law-i-do-not-own-500-million-peter-obi/,http://www.icirnigeria.org/pandora-papers-how-governor-bagudu-amassed-dirty-billions-and-how-he-is-hiding-it/,http://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/6/15/nigeria-inflation-reaches-11-month-high-of-17-percent,http://nairametrics.com/2016/02/08/nigerias-2015-inflation-rate/,http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/03/21/afw-deep-structural-reforms-guided-by-evidence-are-urgently-needed-to-lift-millions-of-nigerians-out-of-poverty,http://worldpoverty.io/map,http://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/nigerias-debt-rose-38-trillion-naira-sept-debt-office-2021-12-14/,http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/465014-analysis-six-years-in-office-buhari-fails-to-deliver-on-economy.html,http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483,http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483,http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483,http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/523567-insecurity-2968-killed-1484-abducted-in-three-months-niger-zamfara-kaduna-most-violent-states.html,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-21/nigerian-president-buhari-s-q-a-with-bloomberg-news-transcript#xj4y7vzkg;Is Buhari Leaving Nigeria a ‘Better Place’?

She called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “a war of Russia vs. all those who hold a basic sense of humanity and chose to act on it.”Ardern said China has become “more assertive and more willing to challenge international rules and norms.”“Here, we must respond to the actions we see,” she said. “We must stand firm on the rules-based order, call for diplomatic engagement and speak out against human rights abuses at all times when and where we see them.”That prompted a response from China’s embassy in New Zealand.“We have taken note of the relevant comment made by the New Zealand side at the NATO session, which includes some misguided accusations against China, claiming that ‘China has in recent times also become more assertive and more willing to challenge international rules and norms.’ That allegation is wrong and thus regrettable,” the embassy stated. “China is firmly committed to upholding multilateralism, supporting the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on the Charter of the U.N., international law and the universally recognized basic norms governing international relations.”Problem is, China’s actual behavior exposes this as false. China has repeatedly flouted rules and norms and bullied other countries, particularly in the South China Sea.A J-15 fighter jet preparing to land on the Chinese navy's Liaoning aircraft-carrier during combat training in the South China Sea. Photo released December 31, 2021. (Hu Shanmin/Xinhua via AP)New Zealand has been less critical of China than other Western countries. However, according to Reuters, New Zealand is increasingly concerned about a security pact between China and the nearby Solomon Islands.The Solomon Islands insists it will not allow China to build a military base there. But analysts say New Zealand fears Beijing might use the pact to gain a strategic foothold and eventually establish a military presence.There is also ambiguity surrounding China’s efforts to upgrade a naval base in Cambodia, which, according to anonymous Western officials, China will be able to use exclusively.A Chinese official in Beijing told The Washington Post that “a portion of the base” would be used by “the Chinese military,” contradicting claims it would be only for the Cambodian Navy.But if Beijing’s intentions in Cambodia and the Solomon Islands remain somewhat unclear, its persistent aggression in the South China Sea – most of which Beijing claims as its own – is abundantly documented.On June 10, the Philippines’ Foreign Ministry filed a diplomatic protest against China’s actions near the Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal. It was the second complaint that week, and the Philippines’ 300th diplomatic protest against Chinese actions that the Philippines regards as illegal.The shoal, in the disputed Spratly Islands, falls within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and is militarily occupied by the Philippines.Land reclamation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands by China in the South China Sea on May 11, 2015. (Associated Press)The Philippines' Foreign Ministry said Chinese Coast Guard vessels had “shadowed Philippine boats on a rotation and re-provision mission,” the Philippines News Agency reported. China was accused of illegally fishing in the area and installing buoys and fishing nets “that blocked the shoal’s entrance.”“The 2016 Arbitral Award affirmed that Ayungin Shoal is within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. China has no right to fish, monitor, or interfere with (the Philippines’) legitimate activities therein,” the Philippines Foreign Ministry said.China rejects that 2016 ruling, in which the Arbitral Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague rebuked China’s sweeping claims to the South China Sea and reaffirmed the Philippines' right to operate within its EEZ.In November 2021, China’s Coast Guard blocked and used water cannons against Philippine resupply ships headed to the shoal, forcing them to turn back.On June 9, the Philippines “protested the return of over 100 Chinese vessels illegally operating in the waters in and around Julian Felipe (Whitsun) Reef,” which also falls within the country’s EEZ.That incident occurred roughly one year after more than 200 Chinese ships “swarmed” the area, sparking tensions between the two countries.On May 31, the Philippines protested what it called the Chinese Coast Guard’s “harassment” of a Taiwanese ship with Filipino scientists carrying out research in the South China Sea.On December 7, 2021, activists in the Philippines protest outside the Chinese Consulate in Makati City on the 5th anniversary of a Hague ruling invalidating Beijing's sweeping claims over the South China Sea. (Reuters)China seized nearby Mischief Reef in 1995. The Hague ruled that the reef is part of the Philippines’ continental shelf. And China seized the Scarborough Shoal, some 137 miles east of the Philippines’ island of Luzon, and has captured islands and reefs from Vietnam.Vietnam accused China of violating its sovereignty by carrying out military drills on June 19 near Woody Island, a Chinese-occupied rock in the Paracel archipelago. China has sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the Paracels.Soldiers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy patrol on Woody Island, in the Paracel Archipelago, which is known in China as the Xisha Islands, on January 29, 2016. (Reuters)The China Coast Guard and “paramilitary fishing fleets” frequently stop at Woody Island before heading elsewhere in the South China Sea “to assert China’s claim to nearly the entire South China Sea,” Radio Free Asia, a Voice of America sister organization, has reported.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, China has sent warships to escort illegal fishing expeditions. China’s fishing fleets are notorious for aggressive tactics, including ramming competitors and foreign patrol ships, and have systematically engaged in illegal fishing as far afield as South America.In March, a top U.S. Navy commander said China had militarized at least three islands in the South China Sea, equipping them with “anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment, and fighter jets,” The Associated Press reported.The commander told AP that China’s actions over the past 20 years constituted “the largest military buildup since World War II by the PRC (People’s Republic of China).”While ignoring other countries' legitimate territorial claims in the South China Sea, China says it is fully entitled to develop the islands as it wishes.The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative says China has established 20 outposts in the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands.

69;;;;False;Yi Ping Hai An (一玶海岸);;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-fake-news-about-pentagon-and-abortion-swirls-on-chinese-social-media/6743408.html;Fake News About Pentagon and Abortion Swirls on Chinese Social Media;2022-06-30;polygraph;;"On June 26, Yi Ping Hai An (一玶海岸), a popular political commentator on Weibo, claimed that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had defied a landmark court ruling reversing a nationwide right to abortion.“The U.S. military does not recognize the U.S. Supreme Court revoking the constitutional right to abortion, which could turn into a constitutional crisis in the United States,” Yi Ping Hai An wrote on China's Twitter-like platform.“The American tradition of apolitical armed forces … just a piece of paper now.”That claim is false and misrepresents remarks by Austin reacting to the ruling.On June 24, the U.S. high court overturned Roe v. Wade, a 1973 ruling that guaranteed a right to abortion with certain limitations. Now, it’s up to the 50 U.S. states to decide if abortion is legal. Dozens have banned and/or restricted it, and many others may follow.The U.S. military does not oppose the court ruling.In a June 24 statement, Austin affirmed that the Defense Department’s commitment to “the health and well-being of our Service members, the civilian workforce and DOD families.”He said the agency was “examining” the court’s decision and “evaluating” its internal policies to ensure continued access to reproductive health care “as permitted by federal law.”The Associated Press quoted a Pentagon spokesperson as saying that “the suggestion the department would ignore the ruling is ‘false’.”Nonetheless, online posts wrongly claiming the Pentagon had rejected the court’s ruling circulated widely on Twitter. The source appeared to be a now-suspended Twitter account, BNN Newsroom.“BREAKING: The Pentagon has stated that any abortion laws enacted as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision will not be recognized,” BNN Newsroom tweeted on June 25.That tweet was shared more than 26,000 times before it was deleted by the account. Still it was amplified by others, including conservative U.S. Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, an opponent of abortion, and the grassroots political organization Occupy Democrats.In his post, Yi Ping Hai An also cited the BNN Newsroom tweet and included a screenshot of it (along with a translation into Chinese), further spreading misinformation on the Chinese Internet.The post also included a screenshot of Austin’s original statement. However, Austin’s statement was not translated, and the post wrongly characterized the statement for its 231,000 Chinese followers.How the court’s abortion ruling will affect the U.S. military remains an open question.The military affairs news site Task and Purpose reported that women in service have had restricted access to abortion for a long time. The military only provides abortions in cases of rape or incest, “or when the mother’s life is in danger,” the newspaper said.For other abortions, a service member would have to go to civilian providers.“Under existing federal law, a military member can seek an abortion outside of a military facility, in accordance with state law where they are located, but the Pentagon will not fund or perform the procedure except in cases of rape, incest or if a woman’s life is in danger,” The Associated Press reported.States “including Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, and Missouri – all of whom are home to military installations – will also not allow abortions in cases of rape or incest,” Task and Purpose said.Gil Cisneros Jr., the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, wrote in a memo on June 28 that the court’s new ruling ""does not prohibit the Department from continuing to perform covered abortions, consistent with federal law. There will be no interruption to this care.”Cisneros said in the memo that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has long held “that States generally may not impose criminal or civil liability on federal employees who perform their duties in a manner authorized by federal law.”However, Cisneros also acknowledged potential legal jeopardy in states.“The implications of the Supreme Court’s decision are complicated and must be evaluated against various state laws, together with the views of the Department of Justice,” the memo said.";https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3073618/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-supreme-courts-ruli/,https://apnews.com/article/Fact-Check-Pentagon-Statement-Abortion-274755472768,https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1541068221536690177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1541068221536690177%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftaskandpurpose.com%2Fnews%2Fpentagon-supreme-court-roe-v-wade%2F,https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1541039344386981890,https://taskandpurpose.com/news/pentagon-supreme-court-roe-v-wade/,https://apnews.com/article/Fact-Check-Pentagon-Statement-Abortion-274755472768,https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/28/2003026770/-1/-1/1/MEMORANDUM-ENSURING-ACCESS-TO-ESSENTIAL-WOMENS-HEALTH-CARE-SERVICES-FOR-SERVICE-MEMBERS-DEPENDENTS-BENEFICIARIES-AND-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE-CIVILIAN-EMPLOYEES.PDF;Fake News About Pentagon and Abortion Swirls on Chinese Social Media;;;;;;

Visit To Falsely Deny Xinjiang Atrocities;2022-06-17;polygraph;;"On June 13, the United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, announced she would not be seeking a second term when her current one ends on August 31. She cited personal reasons, though a highly controversial trip to China last month looms large.Rights groups and Western governments criticized Bachelet for, as France 24 put it, “falling under the wheels of China’s propaganda machine.”Li Jingjing, a reporter for China's state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN), turned the backlash against Bachelet into yet another propaganda exercise.Li said Bachelet had been given the choice between lying for Western governments or “being canceled.”“The U.N. [High] Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, finally visited Xinjiang after being demanded repeatedly by several Western governments,” Li said on her personal YouTube channel. “You would think that [these] Western governments would finally be happy that this third party, independent trip would finally clear the air. Of course not. They got furious. They want her fired. But why? Because after visiting Xinjiang and the rest of China, she didn’t find any evidence of genocide.”That is false.This handout image taken and released on May 25, 2022, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights shows a screen of U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet (L) attending a virtual meeting with China's President Xi Xinping. (OHCHR/AFP)Bachelet’s highly-controlled visit to China, particularly the northwestern Xinjiang region, where Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities face persecution, was never intended to be an investigation.Beijing has framed it as such in an attempt to exonerate the Chinese Communist Party of genocide allegations. That, and other concerns, have spurred criticism of Bachelet’s trip.Bachelet embarked on a six-day official mission to China last month. That visit had been four years in the making.On May 28, Bachelet explicitly stated what her “visit was – and what it wasn’t.”“This visit was not an investigation – official visits by a High Commissioner are by their nature high-profile and simply not conducive to the kind of detailed, methodical, discreet work of an investigative nature,” she said. “The visit was an opportunity to hold direct discussions – with China’s most senior leaders – on human rights, to listen to each other, raise concerns, explore and pave the way for more regular, meaningful interactions in the future, with a view to supporting China in fulfilling its obligations under international human rights law.”So contrary to Li’s claim, Bachelet was not there to find evidence of genocide.Still, the trip generated a great deal of criticism on multiple fronts.Approximately 230 human rights advocacy groups called on Bachelet to resign, alleging she had “whitewashed the Chinese government’s human rights atrocities during her recent visit to China.”The European Parliament likewise expressed concern over Bachelet’s visit and its outcomes, denouncing “the absence of unfettered access and the tight state control to internment facilities” and “the biased perception and picture of the human rights situation in China and in the Xinjiang” it created.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also voiced concerns about Beijing’s “efforts to restrict and manipulate her visit.”Blinken said the conditions imposed on the visit did not provide for “a complete and independent assessment of the human rights environment in the PRC [People’s Republic of China], including in Xinjiang, where genocide and crimes against humanity are ongoing.”“The High Commissioner should have been allowed confidential meetings with family members of Uyghur and other ethnic minority diaspora communities in Xinjiang who are not in detention facilities but are forbidden from traveling out of the region,” Blinken said.At a June 15 U.N. Human Rights Council meeting, Bachelet said she “was not able to speak to any Uyghurs currently detained or their families during the visit.”Blinken added that Bachelet had not been given access to people sent from Xinjiang to other parts of China as a part of labor transfer programs, which one study found occurred “within an environment of unprecedented coercion.”On May 24, one day after Bachelet’s trip to China commenced, a new cache of documents implicating Beijing in rights abuses, called the Xinjiang Police Files, came to light.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, those hacked files include thousands of photographs of people incarcerated in internment camps, classified government documents proving the evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy for detainees who attempt to escape, and transcripts from senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials “tying central government officials” to atrocities in Xinjiang.Bachelet did not address the Xinjiang Police Files revelations during her trip.Bachelet also was highly criticized for seemingly adopting the CCP’s language in describing its policies, which allegedly have included mass internment, torture, religious repression, forced labor, and state-backed sterilization, which some critics say meets the United Nations definition of genocide.In her May 28 statement, Bachelet said she had “raised questions and concerns about the application of counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures and their broad application.” She further repeated Beijing’s claim that it’s so-called Vocational Education and Training Center system “has been dismantled.”Uyghur rights groups said the terms “deradicalization,” “anti-terrorism” and “vocational education and training centers” mimicked Beijing’s rhetoric about its actions in Xinjiang, Radio Free Asia (RFA), a sister organization of Voice of America, reported.“The high commissioner has disgraced herself and her office by refusing to investigate China’s genocide and adopting, repeating the Chinese regime’s narrative, further cementing their propaganda in the U.N.,” Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign for Uyghurs, told RFA.On June 3, 39 scholars of the Uyghur region, its peoples, and related issues in China studies published an open letter to Bachelet regarding her China visit.The scholars said they “were deeply disturbed by her official statement of May 28, which ignored and even contradicted the academic findings that our colleagues, including two signatories to this letter, provided.”They also criticized Bachelet for mirroring Beijing’s language and talking points.“In her statement, High Commissioner Bachelet not only failed to condemn these policies, but she declined to mention any of them beyond the mass internment program, which she referred to using Beijing’s latest euphemism, ‘vocational training education centers.’ Instead, Bachelet asked Beijing to ‘undertake a review of all counter terrorism and de-radicalization policies to ensure they fully comply with international human rights standards’,” the open letter stated.“High Commissioner Bachelet’s words echo the Chinese state’s claim that their atrocities in Xinjiang are all are part of a ‘counterterrorism’ effort, a claim that our research and the Chinese state’s own documents show to be false. Beijing’s state media has, predictably, presented her comments as vindication.”The scholars added that the wealth of evidence regarding the “atrocities in Xinjiang” had led them to an “extraordinary consensus” rarely seen in the academic field. They said Beijing’s actions “can be credibly called a genocidal program.”Benedict Rogers, co-founder and CEO of the Britain-based Hong Kong Watch, and co-founder and deputy chair of the U.K. Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, concurred.“She parroted Beijing’s language about ‘counterterrorism’ and ‘de-radicalization,’ praised China’s role in ‘multilateralism,’ and trumpeted the CCP’s achievements in eradicating poverty. She has turned into a classic useful idiot, played skillfully by Chinese President Xi Jinping,” Rogers wrote in Foreign Policy magazine.Pictures of Xinjiang detainees published at xinjiangpolicefiles.org from leaked police files. (Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation)Rogers called other aspects of Bachelet’s press statement “Orwellian.” He noted that she had “commended China for promoting gender equality but said nothing of well-documented and systematic sexual violence, forced sterilization, forced abortions, human trafficking, torture, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”Amnesty International also criticized Bachelet in a strongly worded statement, saying she “now has just two-and-a-half months to address her failures on China.“Her refusal to call out the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, and their dismal human rights record throughout the country, has betrayed countless victims and survivors. Without immediate action, Michelle Bachelet’s failure to stand up to political pressure from China will be a major part of her legacy,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard.Meanwhile, rights groups, academics and government bodies are pressuring Bachelet to release her office’s long-delayed report concerning allegations of ""serious human rights violations"" in Xinjiang. Bachelet had said the report was being finalized in September and then December 2021.After announcing she would be stepping down, Bachelet said she was working on an updated version of that Xinjiang report, which would be released after first being shared with authorities in Beijing for “factual comment.”New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said news of the revised report “should have prompted cheers,” but instead it “has been received with skepticism and weariness.”HRW said “Bachelet’s credibility took a serious hit after her recent disastrous trip to China,” adding that “[h]er legacy as high commissioner will be measured by her willingness to hold a powerful state like China to account.”“She needs to release a report that sets out a strategy to achieve that outcome, and to make up for lost time by listening to, rather than avoiding, the people living the nightmare of Chinese government oppression,” HRW said.";https://www.unognewsroom.org/story/en/1316/un-sign-commissioner-michelle-bachelet-announces-that-she-will-not-seek-a-second-term,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220527-un-rights-chief-falls-under-wheels-of-china-s-propaganda-machine,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/05/bachelet-conduct-official-visit-china-23-28-may-2022,https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/05/statement-un-high-commissioner-human-rights-michelle-bachelet-after-official,https://tibetadvocacy.org/230-rights-groups-demand-resignation-of-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights/,https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ad360ffab-40cc-4d83-8b8b-a8bd503286a3#pageNum=1,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-leaked-xinjiang-police-files-not-lies-and-rumors/31868453.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-xinjiang-uyghur-persecution/31211924.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-forced-labor-uyghurs-xinjiang/31362816.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-uighur-baby-machines/31043985.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/michelle-bachelet-05312022171641.html,https://jimmillward.medium.com/international-academic-signatories-of-the-open-letter-regarding-uh-high-commissioner-for-human-4c05a2cb309e,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/13/michelle-bachelets-failed-xinjiang-trip-has-tainted-her-whole-legacy/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/06/un-michelle-bachelet-has-just-months-to-address-her-failures-on-china/,https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-is-urged-to-resign-after-china-visit-/6602561.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/14/un-rights-chief-again-promises-xinjiang-report;China Exploits U.N.

On May 20, 2022, the last of Azov’s militants have surrendered. Mariupol was finally liberated from the Ukrainian nationalists.”That is a false representation of Mariupol’s fall to Russian attackers.Images in the video present Russia as liberator and peaceful rebuilder of the city, even as they show the ruins of residential buildings and widespread destruction from Russian bombardments and shelling.Instead, Kyiv is blamed as an “occupier and oppressor.”What really happened?1 – Russia attacked Ukraine after falsely claiming it had no plans to do so. Russia’s invasion has devastated Ukraine, caused millions to flee to other countries and disrupted the world economically and politically. Mariupol has suffered some of the war’s deadliest consequences.2 – United Nations officials, including Secretary-General António Guterres, have condemned Russia’s strikes on hospitals, maternity facilities, civilian buildings and, in Mariupol, a theater where hundreds of people sheltered. An Associated Press investigation found that 600 people died in that Russian airstrike, a daytime attack in March on what was the city’s main bomb shelter with children inside. Russia is slamming Ukraine with 60,000 rockets and artillery shells daily.3 – Ukraine says Russian attacks and aftereffects left more than 20,000 civilians in Mariupol dead and forcibly deported thousands more to filtration camps in the Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine and in Russia, effectively depopulating a city where half a million had lived.4 – Mariupol city officials say Russian troops are stealing and selling humanitarian aid supplies and that a cholera outbreak may lead to more deaths. “There is no drinking water, there is no electricity to boil water, streets are full of garbage. The Russian occupation administration is not able to clean out streets,” Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told the Irish broadcaster RTE. “There are also a lot of ruins in the city. Unfortunately, dead bodies are in these ruins. This together with warm temperatures and rain goes to underground water.”5 – The Russian video shows a parade in Mariupol on May 9, Russia’s WWII Victory Day holiday. The parade was led by Denis Pushilin, head of Russia’s proxy Donetsk People’s Republic. The footage shows a small number of people carrying a long yellow-black striped flag symbolizing Russia’s military might. A Czech Republic-based Russian language news source, Main News Daily, and others reported that most of the parade’s participants were brought on buses from Russia and elsewhere in the Donetsk province.United Nations Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on June 16, 2022, that ""[T]he horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come."" (Reuters)6 – The Washington Post reported that in preparation for the parade, Russian troops cleared away ruins of the bombed-out theater.7 – Regarding the video’s claim of being “under Ukrainian yoke for eight years,” Mariupol was part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1994. Before Russian forces attacked, demolished and took control, Mariupol was part of a Ukraine that had been independent for decades. Over the years, Russia has officially recognized Ukraine's sovereignty. The city was not “liberated” by Russia; it was taken by brutal force after a mass exodus of fearful civilians.8 – News reports say Russian occupation authorities have forced remaining Mariupol residents to attend “denazification classes” and stage “mass demonstrations” in support of the Russian war. “When my mother and I were in line to get food and water, we were forced to listen to stories about how we were being liberated from Nazis,” one woman who escaped Mariupol in May told The Guardian newspaper.Polygraph.info has previously reported on Russia’s false claims that Ukraine’s government is run by fascists and Nazis.";https://twitter.com/RussianEmbassy/status/1537008524244529152?s=20&t=uGe_qNawzlbu7CdUiuO6ZQ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-ukraine-war/31721619.html,https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/debunking-denazification,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-lies-ukraine-war/31745164.html,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-updates,https://twitter.com/MFA_Ukraine/status/1536671926562787328?s=20&t=q5FEMya0UQYWCMK4HQ_E4A,https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1,https://taskandpurpose.com/news/russia-artillery-rocket-strikes-east-ukraine/,https://www.voanews.com/a/at-100-days-russia-ukraine-war-by-the-numbers/6601899.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/reports-russians-deporting-ukrainians-camps-troubles-stalin-survivors-rcna21456,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-mariupol-says-russia-forcefully-deported-thousands-its-people-2022-03-20/,https://news.yahoo.com/mariupol-occupiers-start-selling-stolen-090915425.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cholera-other-diseases-could-kill-thousands-ukraines-mariupol-mayor-2022-06-10,https://about.rte.ie/how-rte-is-funded-2/,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10796979/Russians-hold-Victory-Day-parade-MARIUPOL-taunt-Ukraine-processions.html,https://youtu.be/1U8wgeAei8A,https://www.voanews.com/a/un-human-rights-chief-tragedy-of-mariupol-is-far-from-over-/6620529.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/05/ukraine-mariupol-theater-russia-military-parade/,https://www.britannica.com/place/Mariupol,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-ukraine-history/31719136.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-boy-s-mariupol-diary-illustrates-the-horrors-of-war/31897918.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/16/ukraine-life-in-mariupol-under-russian-occupation,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html;Russia’s Whitewash of the Death and Devastation in Mariupol;;;;;;

It matters because the United States routinely sails warships through the channel, which narrows to 100 miles, to reinforce that the waterway is open to navigation under maritime law.In regard to the Bloomberg report, Wang first reiterated China’s orthodox territorial claims over Taiwan, the island, then claimed there’s no legal basis for the U.S. position on the strait.“It is a false claim when certain countries call the Taiwan Strait ‘international waters’ in order to find a pretext for manipulating issues related to Taiwan and threatening China’s sovereignty and security,” he said.Wang is wrong. International law backs up the right of foreign ships to pass through the strait. And China over the years has sent mixed signals on the matter. Recently, however, China has been more aggressive toward Taiwan, even repeatedly flying warplanes toward the island.In 2017, Liu Zhenmin, then China’s vice foreign minister, justified the passage of a Chinese Navy ship through the strait as a matter of normal affairs, saying: “[T]he Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared by the mainland and Taiwan.”The comment came after the CNS Liaoning, China’s first aircraft carrier, steamed through the strait, a move that prompted Taiwan to “scramble jets and navy ships to closely follow the battle group and monitor the situation,” the state-owned China Daily newspaper reported.Two years later, when a French warship navigated the strait, China initially accused France of “illegally entering Chinese waters.” That language was later removed from the official transcript, according to Bonnie Glaser, then director of China Power Project at the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).“Beijing has expressed irritation previously when the U.S. sent warships through the Taiwan Strait, a key international waterway, but has not described such passages as illegal,” The Financial Times reported at the time.Now, observers say that Beijing’s dismissal of the term “international waters,” and its claim of “sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,” signals a change in policy.“Beijing seems to be making explicit what was only implicit in recent years: that it doesn't believe there is a right to normal transit through the strait,” Greg Poling, director of CSIS’ Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said on Twitter.At his news conference, Wang cited the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to assert that the strait is divided into different zones, “including internal waters, territorial sea, contiguous zone, and the Exclusive Economic Zone.”But that’s not all UNCLOS, known as the law of the sea, has to say; it also backs U.S. and Taiwanese claims that the strait is open.The convention, a treaty that dates to 1982 and took force in 1994, grants every coastal state “the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles,” measured from the state’s coastal low-water mark. States may also claim an “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) stretching another 200 nautical miles.However, Article 17 of the law states that even within a nation’s territorial sea, “ships of all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage.”According to Article 56 of the law, within EEZs states have “sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources.”But Article 58 lays out “rights and duties of other States” within the EEZs. It says that all nations enjoy the freedoms of the high seas, including “navigation and overflight.”The Taiwan Strait is about 220 nautical miles at its widest, so much of the strait falls within the EEZ of China and Taiwan. Although UNCLOS does not use the term “international waters,” it is customary shorthand for waters that lie beyond the territorial sea of any state.Experts say China is all wet.“This seems to be about restrictions on foreign activity through the EEZ, [w]hich is, of course, also illegal,” Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at CSIS, said on Twitter. “[International] law provides no right for China to restrict foreign transit or military activities in it.” “China enjoys limited economic-related sovereign rights & jurisdiction in the portion of the Taiwan Strait that is its EEZ,” added Jonathan Odom, Military Professor of International Law at the Marshall Center for Security Studies. “China may not restrict foreign military activities and transits in those waters or in the airspace above them.”China ratified the law of the sea convention in 1996. The United States has not ratified the convention but recognizes it as international law and custom.";http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-12/china-alarms-us-with-new-private-warnings-to-avoid-taiwan-strait#xj4y7vzkg,http://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-assures-asian-countries-assistance-against-chinese-aggression-/6613049.html,https://www.chinadailyasia.com/nation/2017-01/12/content_15555803.html,https://www.chinadailyasia.com/nation/2017-01/12/content_15555803.html,http://www.ft.com/content/12f4ff22-674d-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf,https://www.marshallcenter.org/en/directory/jonathan-g-odom-jd-llm,https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/u-s-ratification-of-the-law-of-the-sea-convention/,https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lawofsea.html;Backroom China Claims Muddy the Waters of Taiwan Strait;;;;;;

(AP)The Russia-controlled court ordered their executions by firing squad after a two-day trial. They have one month to appeal.Liz Truss, the U.K. foreign secretary, condemned the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who she said are being “held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine.”“They are prisoners of war,"" Truss said on Twitter. ""This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy.”In response, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, rejected the notion that the men are POWs with rights under the Geneva Conventions.“They are mercenaries and not prisoners of war. Mercenaries sent by the West to assist the nationalist regime in Kiev are not combatants and are not entitled to the status of prisoner of war under international humanitarian law,” Zakharova said.That is false.Aslin, Pinner and Moroccan Saaudun Brahim were captured while serving with Ukraine’s armed forces. While captured mercenaries do not have the same protections as POWs under the Geneva Conventions, rights groups and United Nations officials say the three are not, in fact, mercenaries. As such, they are entitled to the same protections as other soldiers.The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) condemned the death sentences, which came from a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR), which only Russia recognizes. “Such trials against prisoners of war amount to a war crime,” said OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani.The spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General’s office, Stephane Dujarric, reaffirmed U.N. opposition to the death penalty, calling on all combatants detained in Ukraine “to be afforded international protection, and to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions.”Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, also called the verdicts “a blatant violation of international humanitarian law on so many counts.”“The three were members of the Ukrainian regular forces and under the Geneva Conventions, as prisoners of war, they are protected from prosecution for taking part in hostilities,” Krivosheev said.Aslin and Pinner were both serving with the 36 Brigade First Battalion of the Ukrainian Marines. They were captured in April after taking part in the defense of the port of Mariupol, which is now occupied by Russia.Rather than being “sent” by the West, both men were living in Ukraine prior to Russia’s invasion and had reportedly joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2018.Aslin, has a Ukrainian fiancé and is a dual British-Ukrainian citizen, the BBC reported. Pinner has a Ukrainian wife.Brahim joined the Ukrainian marines in November 2021, Catherine Norris Trent, a senior reporter for France 24, wrote on Twitter. Brahim surrendered to Russian forces near the city of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region in mid-March.Prior to enlisting, the 21-year-old Brahim was a student at the Institute of Aerospace Technologies at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. His father told the Moroccan Arab-language news site Madar 21 that his son also holds Ukrainian citizenship, reported Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a sister U.S. government news organization to the Voice of America.As previously reported by Polygraph.info, The Third Geneva Convention, concerning the treatment of prisoners of war, states that “members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces” are one of four categories of people who “have fallen into the power of the enemy.”It also says that members of other militias and volunteer corps, including “organized resistance movements,” enjoy prisoner of war protections if they meet four conditions:Being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;Having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;Carrying arms openly;Conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.In its guidance on legal protections for combatants in a war, the International Committee of the Red Cross says a mercenary is ""a person who takes a direct part in hostilities motivated essentially by the desire for private gain.""By comparison, ""A national of a neutral State who enlists in the armed forces of a party to the conflict is not a mercenary,"" the Red Cross says.Mercenaries also cannot be “a national of a Party to the conflict or a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict.”All three men were residing in Ukraine prior to the invasion. As previously noted, Aslin and Brahim reportedly had Ukrainian citizenship. Pinner's actual residency status is unknown.Still, Aslin, Brahim and Pinner were “members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” -- the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Therefore, they do not qualify as mercenaries.Prisoners of war can be tried for a war crimes. However, for such legal proceedings to go forward, “there must be sufficient admissible evidence, and fair trial standards must be ensured,” Krivosheev said.“[T]hey were not tried by an independent, impartial regularly constituted court but by Russian proxies. The so-called ‘charges’ against them would not constitute war crimes. And most outrageously of all, the taking of their lives as result of the grossly unfair proceedings would constitute arbitrary deprivation of life,” Krivosheev said.The aftermath of Russian shelling of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, on June 13, 2022.

The War on Ukraine Threatens a Food Crisis;2022-06-10;polygraph;;On June 8, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited the Turkish capital, Ankara, to discuss opening shipping corridors for the export of Ukrainian grain.During an appearance with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Lavrov downplayed the impact of blocking Ukrainian grain exports at Black Sea ports.Lavrov accused the West of turning a “minor issue” into a “universal catastrophe.” He said “the share of this Ukrainian grain in question is less than 1% of the global production of wheat and other cereals.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (L) and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu (R) speak after a news conference in Ankara on June 8, 2022. (Adem Altan/AFP)“Therefore, the current situation with Ukrainian grain has nothing to do with the food crisis,” he said.That is false. Although numerous factors are driving global food insecurity, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and naval blockade of Ukrainian grain exports are playing a disrupting role that will hit many low-income countries hardest.It is approximately correct that less than 1% of the world’s grain is stuck in Ukrainian ports, but that statistic both obscures and minimizes Russia’s responsibility and the importance of Ukraine’s grain to global supplies.The International Grains Council (IGC) forecasts approximately 2,300 million metric tons of grain will be produced for the 2021/22 marketing year. Roughly 25 million metric tons of grain is trapped in Ukrainian ports, Reuters reported.But grain production and grain exports are different matters.The ICG estimates global trade of total grains for the 2021-22 marketing year at 416 million metric tons – less than a quarter of the total grain production forecast. So, Ukraine’s 25 million stranded metric tons would represent roughly 6% of global trade.India, the second-largest wheat producer (some 13.5% of the total), accounts for less than 1% of global exports. Most of its wheat is consumed at home.Ukraine’s wheat and corn exports were estimated at 10.5% and 12.8%, respectively, of 2021 world exports, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence GTAS Forecasting.The turret of a destroyed armored fighting vehicle is seen in a wheat field outside the town of Ichnia, in Ukraine's Chernihiv region, on June 7, 2022. (Vladyslav Musiienko/Reuters)Several lower-income countries rely on wheat exports from Russia and Ukraine. For instance, Egypt, with a population of 103 million, has imported about 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reported.This is how Juergen Voegele, the World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, explains the situation, noting that wheat is a staple food for 35% of the world’s population:“Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat, accounting for about 18%, nearly 20% of global exports in 2021. And Ukraine accounts for another 10%.“Now, they’re both not the largest producers of wheat – that’s India and China – but they are the largest exporters…“So, [the Russian invasion is] a very significant shock.”With its ports blocked, under attack or taken by Russia (as in Mariupol and Sevastapol) Ukraine has been forced to ship grain by land, drastically reducing export volumes. That hurts lower-income countries.In a March report, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warned “more than 5%of the import basket of the poorest countries are products that are likely to face a price hike resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine.”That share for richer countries “is below 1%,” UNCTAD said.Libya, Lebanon, Mauritania, Somalia and Tunisia are all heavily dependent on Ukrainian wheat, according to UNCTAD data.“In 81 countries where WFP works, acute hunger is expected to rise by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine continues unabated – this is a staggering 17% jump, with the steepest rises in sub-Saharan Africa,” the United Nations’ World Food Program warned.How high are prices going?The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Cereal Price Index for May 2022 increased “as much as [29.7%] above its May 2021 value.” International wheat prices also rose for four months straight.In March, the FAO’s food price index, a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, hit its highest point “since records began in 1990,” because of a halt in Ukrainian exports spurred by Russia’s invasion, Reuters reported in May.There are other factors driving up food prices. Extreme heat and drought conditions around the world, particularly the Horn of Africa, are imperiling millions with hunger and food insecurity.The war in Ukraine, however, is having ripple effects.“The steep increase in wheat prices was in response to an export ban announced by India amidst concerns over crop conditions in several leading exporting countries, as well as reduced production prospects in Ukraine because of the war,” the FAO said.Then there are logistics. Voegele said:“There is enough wheat on the planet and planting more wheat this spring and summer will make up of shortfall to a significant extent if the exports remain blocked out of Ukraine and Russia.“So, it's not really a total supply issue, but the problem is that those countries that are used to importing from [Ukraine and Russia] now have to adjust, and that will not be painless and it will be very costly.”Meantime, Lavrov attempted to blame Western economic sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the looming food crisis. He offered to lift the blockade in exchange for sanctions relief.Lavrov also blamed Ukraine for placing mines around the port city of Odesa. Ukraine has said it cannot remove the mines without guarantees against a Russian amphibious assault on Odesa.Russia decimated the port city of Mariupol and recently attacked a grain terminal complex at the port of Mykolaiv.“Another Russian missile strike contributing to the global food crisis. Russian forces have destroyed the second-biggest grain terminal in Ukraine, in Mykolaiv,” tweeted Josep Borrell, the European Union foreign policy chief.“In light of such reports, the disinformation spread by Putin deflecting blame becomes ever more cynical,” he said.The United States also alleges Russia is attempting to sell plundered Ukrainian grain to drought-afflicted African countries, The New York Times reported.Russia has denied that allegation.A Ukrainian journalist at the Ankara press conference confronted Lavrov about the theft accusation, asking: “Apart from cereals, what other goods did you steal from Ukraine and who did you sell them to?”Lavrov replied: “You [Ukrainians] are always worried about what you can steal and you think everyone thinks that way.”Lavrov then repeated debunked claims that Russia is saving people in Ukraine “from the pressure of the neo-Nazi regime” and is not obstructing the movement of grain in Ukraine.;https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-russia-talks-make-little-progress-on-ukraine-grain-shipments/6608703.html,https://www.igc.int/en/gmr_summary.aspx,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nearly-25-mln-tonnes-grain-stuck-ukraine-un-food-agency-2022-05-06/,https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1786624,https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/indias-wheat-exports-on-steady-rise-but-makes-for-less-than-1-of-global-share-325317-2022-03-09,https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/ukraine-agriculture-exports-what-is-at-stake.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/egypts-wheat-imports-russia-rose-march-despite-war-2022-04-05/,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2022/04/05/the-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-food-security-world-bank-expert-answers,https://www.voanews.com/a/6582949.html,https://www.britannica.com/place/Sevastopol,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-24/russia-is-winning-from-the-global-food-crisis-it-helped-create,https://www.wfp.org/stories/needs-all-time-high-even-war-ukraine-food-crises-report-says,https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/,https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/FOOD/zjvqkgomjvx/,https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FIGCgrains%2Fstatus%2F1504540824733986819&widget=Tweet,https://www.cimmyt.org/blogs/wheat-versus-heat/,https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/horn-africa-drought-humanitarian-key-messages-25-april-2022,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/05/world/africa/ukraine-grain-russia-sales.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/09/ukrainian-journalist-confronts-russias-sergei-lavrov-with-grain-theft-claim?CMP=fb_gu&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR0_MygMO0TgNsT_K43361_n8GrjXGMvYnFzVB4HuJfQDCU3fU7rDLaerOo#Echobox=1654754538,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html;Russia is Wrong.

By contrast, he said, Russia is striking Ukrainian military positions and facilities with “high precision weapons.”Shoigu said the expedited military shipments to Ukraine from the United States and European countries signal fears that Ukrainian forces will be defeated. Despite this, Shoigu said Russia would continue its so-called “special military operation in Ukraine” until “all its objectives are achieved.” Shoigu’s characterization of Russia’s progress in the war and concern for Ukrainian civilians are misleading.In fact, abundant evidence shows that Russia has targeted civilian populations and infrastructure, terrifying rather than protecting them. The Ukrainian forces’ fierce resistance and Russia’s losses of heavy equipment and personnel have forced Moscow to scale back both its objectives and operations.Also abundant: Allegations of Russian war crimes against Ukrainian civilians.In April, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said international humanitarian law had seemingly been “tossed aside” since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24.“Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, actions that may amount to war crimes,” Bachelet said.Prominent examples include Russia’s bombing of the Mariupol theater on March 16, which an Associated Press investigation found killed 600 people taking shelter there. A week earlier, Russia struck a maternity hospital in Mariupol, sparking international outrage.People walk past the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol after a March 16, 2022, Russian airstrike on the building, which was being used as a bomb shelter. (Alexei Alexandro/Associated Press)Relentless Russian shelling left Mariupol in ruins, likely killing thousands according to Ukrainian accounts. On May 24, workers found 200 bodies in a basement while sifting through the ruins of a destroyed apartment building.As of May 22, the Bachelet’s office recorded 8,462 civilian casualties in Ukraine — 3,930 killed and 4,532 injured. The office said, as always, it “believes that the actual figures are considerably higher” because of the ongoing fighting.Mariupol's mayor claimed 21,000 civilians were killed in his city alone.Across Ukraine, evidence of war crimes emerged after Ukrainian forces regained control of areas previously under Russian occupation.Most infamously, evidence of rape, torture, and summary execution of civilians was discovered in the Kyiv region town of Bucha after Ukrainian forces liberated it in early April.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Russia’s actions in Bucha “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.”Amnesty International found that “residents of other neighboring towns and villages also experienced serious violations during Russia’s occupation of those areas."" Those violations included devastating airstrikes that hit residential apartment buildings, and the extrajudicial execution of civilians after torture.Human Rights Watch documented “22 apparent summary executions, 9 other unlawful killings, 6 possible enforced disappearances, and 7 cases of torture” in 17 villages and small towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, which were under Russian occupation from late February through mid-March.Similar allegations of rape and war crimes are emerging in Ukraine’s east and south, the focus of Russia’s attacks at the moment.Analysts say Russia’s offensive is slowing down for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with protecting civilians.On May 23, former Australian army Gen. Mike Ryan tweeted that Russia’s military forces are likely in the short-term to “reach the limit of their offensive capability,” pushing them to transition to “a defensive strategy.”Ryan noted that “[t]housands of Russians soldiers have been killed or wounded, and hundreds of armored vehicles destroyed in the east of the country. For all this effort, the Russians have gained little additional territory in the past month.”According to Oryx, a military analysis website that documents equipment losses in the Ukraine war, “Russia is now visually confirmed to have lost 700 tanks since it began its invasion of Ukraine three months ago.”Russia has lost thousands more vehicles of other types, including 400 armored fighting vehicles.Russia does not release accurate death statistics for its troops, and Western sources view Ukraine’s estimate of 27,000 Russian troops killed as high, France 24 reported.On May 23, Britain’s Defense Ministry estimated that, in the three months since invading Ukraine, Russia had likely suffered a death toll similar to what the Soviet Union experienced during its nine-year-long war in Afghanistan – about 15,000.Some defense analysts have suggested Russia’s war in Ukraine has reached the culminating point — that is, when the attacking force can’t maintain its offensive.Others dispute this.“I don't think the Russian offensive looks stalled, and while sluggish, there is no good way to predict when it will culminate,” tweeted Michael Kofman, research program director for the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses.A senior Pentagon official likewise told Agence France-Presse it might be premature to say that Russia’s campaign has reached a culminating point.Russia forces maintain numerical and firepower superiority, but they have seen limited breakthroughs. The Pentagon official noted they are maintaining “a long front from the Donbas south and west toward Mykolaiv.”A map of Ukraine. (wikipedia.org courtesy photo)The capture of Mariupol and the Kherson region has given Russia a land bridge to Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014.Russia’s main focus appears to be on expanding its control over eastern Ukraine. Reports suggest Russia will move to annex the territory it has occupied, possibly through sham referendums, as it did in Crimea.As with Mariupol, Russia has employed its tactic of indiscriminate destruction in its attempts to capture Severodonetsk, the last city Ukraine holds in the Luhansk province.“Round-the-clock there is shelling, and unfortunately the Russian army chose the scorched-earth tactic against the city of Severodonetsk: They are simply systematically destroying the city. Everywhere is being shelled constantly,” Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk Oblast, told The Washington Post.On May 21, Russian forces destroyed a bridge into Severodonetsk, “making it harder to evacuate people and bring in supplies,” the Post reported.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of “trying to destroy all living things” in Ukraine’s east, the Los Angeles Times reported.“Literally,” Zelenskyy said. “Nobody destroyed Donbas as the Russian military does now.”The shifting nature of Russia’s offensive is reflected in its evolving aims.According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces “have likely abandoned efforts to complete a single large encirclement of Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.” They have shifted to securing “smaller encirclements – enabling them to make incremental measured gains” in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Washington-based think tank reported on May 24.“Russian forces have secured more terrain in the past week than efforts earlier in May,” the ISW wrote. “However, they have done so by reducing the scope of their objectives – largely abandoning operations around Izyum and concentrating on key frontline towns: Russian performance remains poor.”Still, with Russia controlling a contiguous piece of Ukrainian territory and a decisive victory unlikely for either side, “signs are growing that the war could become a protracted stalemate,” NPR reported.";https://en.odkb-csto.org/,https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-mariupol-hosital-bombed-russia/31744934.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-0c74a0c16b834732b81e460450da3131,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/05/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-23-may-2022,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-60894476,https://news.yahoo.com/bucha-massacre-police-exhume-bodies-050303616.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61071243,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/04/11/world/europe/bucha-terror.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-waged-deliberate-campaign-commit-atrocities-bucha-blinken-2022-04-05/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EUR5055612022ENGLISH.pdf,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/18/ukraine-executions-torture-during-russian-occupation,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-war-crimes-rape/31818846.html,https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220517-young-poor-and-from-minorities-the-russian-troops-killed-in-ukraine,https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/pentagon-warns-war-will-stretch-out-despite-ukraine-successes.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/world/europe/moscow-russifying-captured-territory.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/24/russia-annex-breakaway-territories/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/23/severodonetsk-ukraine-russia-battle-east/,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-24/ukraine-russian-troops-set-encircle-strategic-city,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-may-24,https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1100898004/a-battlefield-assessment-three-months-after-russia-invaded-ukraine;Misleading: Russia Slows Ukraine Offensive to Save Civilians;;;;;;
76;;;;Misleading;Wang Wenbin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-leaked-xinjiang-police-files-not-lies-and-rumors/6743380.html;Leaked Xinjiang Files Are Not Just ‘Lies and Rumors’;2022-05-25;polygraph;;On May 24, a new trove of documents and photographs came to light that further details alleged human rights abuses in China’s mass-detention program targeting ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.The cache of documents, dubbed the Xinjiang Police Files, were hacked from police computer servers in Xinjiang, where Beijing’s persecution of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups has been called a crime against humanity by international human rights organizations.The hacked files, received by Xinjiang-focused researcher Adrian Zenz, include thousands of photographs of people incarcerated in internment camps, as well as classified government documents that include those describing a shoot-to-kill policy for detainees who try to escape.In sum, the documents and photos, some of which show detainees bound during interrogation or guarded by figures in tactical gear, refute China’s claims that its detention centers are benign re-education facilities.The leak coincided with this week’s visit to Xinjian by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet. At a press briefing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked to confirm whether the files were “legitimate content from Chinese police servers.”Instead, spokesman Wang Wenbin dismissed the leak as “the latest example of the anti-China forces’ smearing of Xinjiang.”“The lies and rumors they spread cannot deceive the world,” he said.That is misleading.Publication of the Xinjiang Police Files came after a months-long effort to investigate and authenticate the leaked materials by a research team at the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VCMF), where Zenz is a senior fellow, and the media consortium.According to Zenz, the files “were obtained by an individual who gained access to the internal police computer networks of two predominantly Uyghur and Kazakh counties in Xinjiang: Konasheher (Shufu) and Tekes (Tekesi).”The leaker, who remained anonymous for security reasons, passed on the files to Zenz, who then shared them with the media consortium earlier this year.The files, most dating to 2017-2018, reveal new information about the internment camps in Xinjiang, which Beijing calls “vocational skills education and training centers (VSETC).”According to the VCMF, the files include:Mug shots of more than 2,800 detainees and images of police drills and police interrogation. The youngest detainee photographed was 14-year-old Rahile Omer.Confidential government documents, including police spreadsheets of detainees, lists of police staff and guards and security directives.Raw transcripts of internal speeches by senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials, some of which serve as “evidence tying central government officials to the atrocity.”Zenz analyzed and authenticated the files in a peer-reviewed academic paper published in the Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies on May 24.In the paper, he reviewed high-ranking CCP officials’ internal speeches and policy documents by comparing them to “previously-published internal state documents.” That is a reference to the Xinjiang Papers, a cache of Chinese government documents on Xinjiang leaked to The New York Times by a “member of the Chinese political establishment” and published in 2019.Zenz examined the authenticity of photographs.“Based on image-linked ID numbers, images were examined by age group, gender, and the location and sequence in which they were taken. The IDs were then compared to sets of other IDs contained in the files, as well as to external sources,” he explained in the paper.“Where available, image metadata such as date and camera serial number were analyzed, permitting assessments of whether images were taken using identical or different cameras,” he added. “Internment facility locations were corroborated using satellite imagery, construction bids, and geolocation analysis that matched internal documents and images of facilities with corresponding satellite images.”The 14 media outlets conducted their own independent work on the Xinjiang Police Files.For example, the BBC said the images “can be verified by being shown to contain real people, identified as the missing relatives of a number of overseas Uyghurs approached by the BBC.”The BBC was able to “verify the spreadsheets containing the photographs, ID numbers and cell phones for camp police officers.”“[A]fter dialing the numbers listed for more than 150 police officers and government officials, several picked up and confirmed their names, roles and respective offices,” the BBC said.USA Today said that while the consortium was “not able to independently verify the authenticity of all the data and photographs in the files,” the group “found evidence to support Zenz's conclusions.”“Some photos include geolocation data that places them near the detention center Zenz identified. One of the party officials is known to have visited Xinjiang on the date cited in his speech. And coalition journalists interviewed Uyghurs, no longer living in China, who identified relatives who appear in the files,” the newspaper reported.The documents add to body of leaked Chinese government documents, witness accounts and satellite imagery that have revealed mass detentions in both the VSETCs and formal prisons since 2017.France’s Le Monde newspaper, which also reviewed the hacked files, wrote that they “tell the inside story of Beijing's security obsession with this Muslim minority and shed light on the repressive nature of the ‘re-education’ of Uyghurs in ‘vocational training centres.’”The Chinese government has consistently dismissed accusations of human rights violations in Xinjiang as “lies and rumors” fabricated by “anti-China forces.”The Chinese assert that the “re-education” camps are intended to improve the detainees’ vocational skills and alleviate poverty. Beijing also says that some of the security measures are part of a campaign to combat what it calls extremism and terrorism by Uyghur separatists.“Xinjiang has taken a host of decisive, robust and effective deradicalization measures,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson with the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement responding to a list of questions about the files from the consortium of media outlets.“The region now enjoys social stability and harmony, as well as economic development and prosperity. The local people are living a safe, happy and fulfilling life,” Liu said.Liu did not address the reporters’ specific questions about the leaked files.;https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220525-xi-speaks-with-bachelet-defends-china-s-rights-progress,https://victimsofcommunism.org/about/leadership/,https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/public-security-ministers-speech-describes-xi-jinpings-direction-of-mass,http://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Xinjiang-Police-Files-Fact-Sheet-220523c.pdf,http://victimsofcommunism.org/xinjiang-police-files-summary-policy-recommendations/,https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/article/view/7336/7290,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html,https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/article/view/7336/7290,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/85qihtvw6e/the-faces-from-chinas-uyghur-detention-camps,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-8df450b3-5d6d-4ed8-bdcc-bd99137eadc3,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2022/05/24/xinjiang-police-files-uyghur-detention-genocide/7058853001/,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/05/24/xinjiang-police-files-exclusive-documents-reveal-china-s-machine-of-repression-against-the-uyghurs_5984537_4.html;Leaked Xinjiang Files Are Not Just ‘Lies and Rumors’;;;;;;

But these are not toxic substances and do not combine to create chemical compounds that are highly toxic,” Dan Kaszeta, an associate fellow of the U.K.-based Royal United Services Institute, told Polygraph.info.Kaszeta is also author of the book “Toxic: A History of Nerve Agents from Nazi Germany to Putin’s Russia.”One analyst said the ministry’s “warning” could be a sign that Russia is planning a false-flag operation involving chemical weapons. If so, “the West should treat it as an illegal assault with toxic chemicals,” said Margarita Assenova, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C.It’s not the first time that Russia has introduced the idea that Ukraine might use chemical or biological weapons and then blame it on the Kremlin.In March, after the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukraine was planning a false-flag chemical attack, the United States warned that Russia may actually be preparing one.“We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false-flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it,” then-White House press secretary Jan Psaki said.According to former Lithuanian Defense Minister Rasa Jukneviciene, who is now a member of the European Parliament, such claims are part of the disinformation war Moscow is waging in tandem with its military invasion.“I would even call it a psychological operation or a weapon of mass brain destruction,” she said. “It is especially effectively used in Russian Federation against Russians themselves in so-called rear front, so that Russian people are poisoned with lies and support [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his ‘special operation’.”Here is the Russian Defense Ministry's statement in full:""In addition, in Lisichansk, Lugansk People's Republic, in the building and hangars of a rare gas plant, units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine placed cannon artillery and MLRS, mined containers with chemically hazardous substances, and employees of the plant and local residents were forcibly kept in underground structures.""At the same time, the nationalists systematically fire at the positions of the Russian Armed Forces and the formations of the Luhansk People's Republic from the MLRS, thereby provoking them to retaliate in order to further accuse them of killing civilians and creating a man-made disaster in the city.""Clarification: This fact check has been updated to more specifically summarize the Russian false-flag claim and to include the entire Defense Ministry statement on the matter.";https://news.yahoo.com/luhansk-military-administration-russian-troops-062643806.html,https://radiosputnik-ria-ru.translate.goog/20220523/provokatsiya-1790277278.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en,https://directories.gasworld.com/directory/lisichansk-oxygen-rare-gas-works/47158.details,https://rusi.org/people/kaszeta,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53414410-toxic,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-new-twist-on-russia-s-bio-weapons-claim-may-be-from-a-video-game-/31752811.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-warns-russia-use-chemical-weapons-false-flag-operation-ukraine-rcna19391;Unsubstantiated: Ukraine Mined a Chemical Plant to Blame Russians;;;;;;

As of this writing, Weibo posts circulating the video have accumulated more than 110 million views.The video purportedly features independent journalists who claim they were unable to “speak the truth” about Russia’s war against Ukraine. But the so-called truths are actually debunked Kremlin falsehoods that attempt to blame Ukraine for carnage caused by Russian forces.The post follows a pattern. Chinese state media reliably spread Russian war propaganda.The Weibo post says:“In a recent United Nations meeting, independent journalists from France, Italy, the Netherlands and other countries criticized Western media for false propaganda in their coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.“However, they were fired from their jobs and even banned from entering their own countries for insisting on telling the truth they had observed about the Ukraine issue.”That is misleading.In fact, several of the “independent journalists” in the video have a track record of regurgitating Kremlin-speak. There is no evidence that any of them have been fired or exiled, though some of their work has been disputed and flagged as disinformation.The U.N. meeting mentioned was what’s called an “Arria-formula meeting.” These are informal sessions that any Security Council member may schedule and orchestrate.Russia called the May 6 session to discuss alleged war crimes by Ukrainian forces. This was after a crush of reports alleging war crimes by Russian troops who’d occupied suburbs outside Kyiv, leaving behind mass graves and civilians who appeared to have been summarily executed.Russia’s Permanent Representative to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia opened the session.“Today, we will try to speak as little as possible by ourselves and to share with you accounts of the residents of Eastern and Southern Ukraine and to give the floor to foreign journalists who have been working in these areas,” Nebenzia said.Out spilled some of the false claims Russia has used to justify its invasion and to deny war crimes and indiscriminate strikes on civilian targets, including businesses, theaters and hospitals.A Russian national flag flies by destroyed buildings in Mariupol on April 12, 2022. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP)Anne-Laure Bonnel, a French filmmaker described by Foreign Policy magazine as “a noted propagandist on behalf of Russia,” said Western economic sanctions against Russia have fanned divisions and hatred. She accused Ukrainian troops of killing Russian-speaking Ukrainians in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region for the past eight years.Bonnel made the same claim in her 2016 documentary “Donbass,” which Facebook and YouTube have repeatedly flagged as a possible source of misinformation. France’s Le Figaro newspaper removed an article Bonnel wrote based on the film, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency and the Latin American Telesur agency reported.After illegally annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Russia helped incite and sustain a militant separatist movement in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, now the focus of Russia’s expanded war. Over eight years, more than 14,000 civilians and combatants died in that conflict.The destroyed Luhansk International Airport on September 11, 2014. (Philippe Desmazes/AFP)Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of pursuing genocide against Russia speakers in the region. But Ukraine denies it, and other authorities, including the International Criminal Court (ICC) and Donbas residents themselves, have refuted the allegation.At the U.N. session, Sonja van den Ende, a Dutch reporter embedded with Russian troops in southeastern Ukraine, also accused Ukrainian forces of killing Ukrainian civilians in Donbas.“I saw the war, yet we cannot speak the truth,” she said at the meeting. “We are censored in Europe.”But then van den Ende brought up the widely debunked Russian claim that Ukrainians, and not Russian bombardments, were responsible for a deadly attack on a Mariupol theater in March.According to witnesses, Russian aircraft struck the theater at about 10 a.m. on March 15. Half the estimated 1,200 people sheltering inside were killed, an Associated Press investigation concluded. The word “children” was painted in huge white script outside for pilots to see.Still, Van den Ende testified that Ukrainian soldiers blew up the theater from inside, and that “there were no bombings from Russians” the day the theater was destroyed.On April 13, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) called the theater bombing and Russian airstrikes on a maternity hospital in Mariupol apparent war crimes. Giorgio Bianchi, an Italian filmmaker, testified that mainstream European media are spreading propaganda and “fake news” about the war.Bianchi said he had returned from filming in Donbas and that Ukrainian soldiers and militias “extensively used civilians as human shields,” another recurring Russian assertion.Bianchi provided no evidence. On the other hand, multiple media reports citing named sources on the ground showed that Russian troops used Ukrainian civilians, even children, as shields.The international community has called for and launched efforts to hold accountable those who ordered and perpetrated war crimes in Ukraine. The United Nations, the ICC, and the OSCE have launched investigations into atrocities, as has Ukraine’s top prosecutor.On April 28, Ukrainian prosecutors filed criminal charges against Russian soldiers accused of war crimes while occupying Bucha, a Kyiv suburb. The filings came after the United States revealed evidence that Russians executed surrendering Ukrainian soldiers in Donbas.On May 19, an investigation by The New York Times revealed newly obtained videos and witness testimony alleging that Russian paratroopers executed at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4. Surveillance video showed Russian troops leading the men away before they were shot outside a temporary Russian command post. One who survived described the event.On May 18, a Russian tank commander pleaded guilty to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian and said he would accept any punishment handed down by the Ukrainian court.Russian military Vadim Shishimarin in the courtroom, who is on trial in Ukraine for the murder of a civilian. Kyiv, May 18, 2022. (Efrem Lukatsky/AP)The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said in April that her team had documented during a one-day visit to Bucha the unlawful killing of 50 civilians, mostly men but also of women and children, some of whom were summarily executed, UPI reported.She said her office was also looking into reports of more than 300 other killings, including executions, in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy.;http://weibo.com/1656831930/LtqgDgcLu?refer_flag=1001030103_,https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23多国独立记者因真实报道俄乌冲突被解职%23,https://m.s.weibo.com/vtopic/detail?click_from=searchpc&q=%23多国独立记者因真实报道俄乌冲突被解职%23,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-ukraine-war-disinformation/31836899.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-distorts-canadian-sniper-ukraine-tale/31848460.html,https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-security-council-working-methods/arria-formula-meetings.php,https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1p/k1pvngjn8e,https://russiaun.ru/en/news/arria_060522,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/23/chinese-state-media-russian-misinformation-worldwide/,https://english.cctv.com/2022/03/31/ARTIyTCDuTlFUxepib46XwYu220331.shtml,https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Le-Figaro-Censors-Journalist-Anne-Laure-Bonnels-Donbas-Article-20220313-0010.html,https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3167339/russia-using-false-genocide-claims-pretext-ukraine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/world/europe/putin-ukraine-genocide.html,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/22/facebook-posts/no-evidence-support-claims-ukraine-killing-people-/,https://www.npr.org/2022/03/11/1085979641/putin-claims-russia-speakers-were-being-killed-in-ukraine-is-that-true,https://apnews.com/article/Russia-ukraine-war-mariupol-theater-c321a196fbd568899841b506afcac7a1,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/a/515868.pdf#page=20,/www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61020565,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/ukrainian-children-used-as-human-shields-near-kyiv-say-witness-reports,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/quintet-attorneys-general-statement-support-prosecutor-general-ukraine-and-investigations-and,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2022/04/28/Ukrainians-executed-Russian-war-crimes/7051651120048/,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/world/europe/russia-bucha-ukraine-executions.html?referringSource=articleShare,https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-soldiers-war-crimes-trial-in-ukraine-to-hear-more-evidence-11652951390,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2022/04/28/Ukrainians-executed-Russian-war-crimes/7051651120048/;China Trumpets Sham Russian Claims About War Coverage;;;;;;
79;;;;False;Kim Dotcom;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-pro-russian-falsehoods-kim-dotcom/6743375.html;Pro-Russian Falsehoods From Kim Dotcom, Alleged Racketeer;2022-05-19;polygraph;;On May 10, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby appeared with Fox News’ “Your World” host Neil Cavuto to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Cavuto brought up U.S. Sen. Angus King of Maine, who had asked the intelligence community to do some “soul-searching” regarding its mistaken belief that Russia would quickly overrun Ukrainian forces.“What we missed was the will to fight of the Ukrainians ... and we also missed that in Afghanistan,” King had said.In that context, Cavuto asked Kirby whether the United States could have delivered weaponry and other aid to Ukraine “months ago,” before Russia launched a multiple-front invasion on February 24.Kirby responded that President Joe Biden’s administration had been “flowing in weapons well before the invasion.” He added that since 2014, when Russia first launched a proxy war in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. and allies had helped Ukraine’s military break from a “very top-down, rigid, doctrinal [Soviet-era]” style to one of “small unit leadership, command-and-control, operational maneuver.”That prompted Kim Dotcom, a German ex-pat who’s facing extradition to the United States for allegations of racketeering and online piracy, to spread pro-Kremlin falsehoods to his 815,000-plus followers on Twitter:“Over 14,000 civilians of Russian ethnicity in the Donbass were killed by US trained Ukrainian forces and the @PentagonPresSec openly boasts that they have armed and trained the Ukrainians for 8 YEARS. Who would have ever expected a Russian response?”Problem is, Dotcom has it backward. The United States was long reluctant to give Ukraine lethal military aid, even as Russia fomented war there for years. And as to the claim that 14,000 civilians previously were killed in eastern Ukraine?In fact, the 14,000 figure includes combatants and civilians, with combatants making up the majority of the deaths. Many of them were Ukrainian servicemen, and thus obviously were not “killed by US trained Ukrainian forces,” as Dotcom said. Nor were all of “Russian ethnicity.”Dotcom’s falsehoods, however, do align with one of the Kremlin’s misleading justifications for its war — namely, that Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine were being persecuted. This is disputed by Ukraine and many Russian speakers there.Russian state media outlets have taken to amplifying Dotcom’s messaging about the war, as it often targets the United States for blame.Dotcom, a German citizen residing in New Zealand, has for a decade fought extradition to the United States to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering in connection with his Megaupload file-sharing service, which the U.S. Department of Justice shut down in 2012. He denies wrongdoing.But back to his tweet about U.S. aid and the 14,000 “civilians of Russian ethnicity,” here are the facts:According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, from April 14, 2014, to December 31, 2021, 14,400 conflict-related deaths were recorded in Ukraine. That includes 3,404 civilians, 4,400 Ukrainian armed forces and 6,500 “members of armed groups” – meaning Russia-backed forces.The death toll for the Ukrainian military and Russia-backed fighters includes fatalities “resulting from imprudent handling of ammunition or weapons, road incidents, diseases, killings and suicides while on service in the conflict zone,” the U.N. says.A road sign pierced by shrapnel stands at a new terminal of Donetsk Airport destroyed by shelling, in Donetsk, October 25, 2015. (Max Black/AP)The United States did provide aid to Ukraine after Russia’s clandestine invasion in 2014, but only in reaction to Russian aggression, and not the other way around.According to the U.S. State Department, since 2014, “the United States has provided more than $6.5 billion in security assistance for training and equipment to help Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity, secure its borders, and improve interoperability with NATO,” the U.S.-European defense alliance.Since January 2021, the United States has pumped in $4.5 billion more to Ukraine to help it protect “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Biden has asked the U.S. Congress for $33 billion more, with USA Today estimating that U.S. aid to Ukraine “could hit $53 billion.”The United States has long tried to avoid such an escalation, however, and only signed off on selling anti-tank missiles to Ukraine in March 2018 – roughly four years after Russia annexed Crimea and seeded the conflict in Ukraine’s east.As the Voice of America reported at the time, Ukraine had been asking the United States for lethal military aid since 2014, “but the Obama administration offered only training and support equipment rather than contribute to escalated violence.”While Russia long denied it was directly operating inside Ukraine territory, the Buk-TELAR missile system used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, was delivered to Ukraine from Kursk, Russia, by the Russian Army’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. (The subsequent crash killed all 298 people on board. Russia undermined the investigation.)Ukraine maintains that nine Russian army battalion tactical groups intervened in the August 2014 Battle of Ilovaisk, leading to a large loss of life on the Ukrainian side.Russia denied it, but researchers, journalists and open-source investigators have provided evidence ​that Russian combat forces participated in the fight. That includes documentation showing that military hardware deployed in the battle was only used by Russian military.In December 2021, New Zealand’s top court ruled that Dotcom could be extradited, but the final decision remains in the hands of the country’s Justice Minister.;https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/your-world-on-ukraine-border-crisis-rick-scotts-tax-plan,http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-intel-questioned-for-misjudging-afghanistan-ukraine/ar-AAX7l2p?ocid=EMMX&cvid=93e9155a75f5458d884e7320338e2d28,https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-russia-falsely-blames-ukraine-for-starting-war/a-60999948,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/20/ukraine-nationalist-attacks-russia-supporters-kremlin-deaths,http://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/world/europe/putin-ukraine-genocide.html,https://twitter.com/SputnikInt/status/1505491730375741442,https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1524262877733199872,https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1524168732825636866,http://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211221-fresh-blow-for-kim-dotcom-in-us-extradition-fight,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-charges-leaders-megaupload-widespread-online-copyright-infringement,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16642369,https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Conflict-related%20civilian%20casualties%20as%20of%2031%20December%202021%20%28rev%2027%20January%202022%29%20corr%20EN_0.pdf,https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/17/ukraine-aid-bill-break-down/9674471002/?gnt-cfr=1,http://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-sale-of-lethal-aid-to-ukraine/4277150.html,/a/31452749.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-mh17-trial/31452749.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17/dutch-prosecutors-say-russia-tried-to-thwart-investigation-of-mh17-downing-idUSKBN20X2LL,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49426724,http://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-battle-of-ilovaisk,http://apnews.com/article/technology-business-new-zealand-copyright-extradition-be77a708b74bb972048bb14f44a31615,http://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211221-fresh-blow-for-kim-dotcom-in-us-extradition-fight;Pro-Russian Falsehoods From Kim Dotcom, Alleged Racketeer;;;;;;

(Emilio Morenatti/AP).He also claimed that unarmed Ukrainians are free to leave the country at any time, while Russia provides humanitarian assistance that is attacked by Ukrainian forces.“Russia is the only country that delivers direct humanitarian aid to people (food, water, provide medical care). Sometimes Russian humanitarian caravans are bombed with weapons that NATO supplies to Ukraine. As the American bombers used to do when they bombed Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam,” Russia’s Embassy in the Philippines summarized Klimov as saying.There is no evidence Ukrainian forces are bombing Russian humanitarian convoys with “NATO weapons.”It is also unclear what Klimov meant by direct humanitarian aid. As Russia invaded Ukraine and occupies parts of its territory, he could mean the Russia military is in a position to provide “direct” aid to civilian populations (without transferring it through international aid organizations or other mechanisms).Still, dozens of countries are providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in response to the catastrophe Russia has created.Chief among them is the United States.“The United States is the largest single-country donor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,” a spokesperson for the United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) told Polygraph.info.“The United States has already provided over $653 million in humanitarian assistance to refugees, the displaced, vulnerable populations and communities in the region since Russia first invaded Ukraine eight years ago, including nearly $302 million this year,” the OSCE spokesperson said.“Our assistance covers critical needs, such as safe drinking water, shelter, winterization services, livelihoods assistance, sanitation, hygiene supplies, emergency health supplies, and protection services to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as emergency food assistance.”The OSCE spokesperson also noted a March 24 White House announcement that the United States is prepared to provide an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine and beyond, in part due to “a marked rise in food insecurity.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to what the United Nations called a “grave humanitarian crisis,” creating an estimated 5.6 million refugees, 7.7 million internally displaced people, thousands of civilian casualties, and millions of people in need, including children.The head of the World Food Program said Russia’s war in Ukraine could lead to the worst global food crisis since World War II.Many countries and organizations are working to prevent catastrophe.The United States, for example, delivers humanitarian aid through U.S.-funded nongovernmental groups and international organizations like the United Nations.Data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also show that the United States and its partners remain the largest donors for U.N. humanitarian response plans and funds.The European Commission, through its EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine, has channeled nearly 24,000 tons of aid to Ukraine from 29 countries — all 27 E.U. member states, plus Norway and Turkey. The U.K. also has pledged about $240 million in humanitarian assistance.Alexii and Oleg Vadimovich prepare their car to deliver humanitarian aid in the districts of Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, on April 26, 2022. (Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP)United Nations-led inter-agency convoys, working with non-governmental partners, had delivered supplies to Ukraine five times as of April 24.And more than 100 Ukrainian non-governmental organizations are working across the country to prevent disaster. One Ukrainian NGO said the biggest threat to its work was “constant shelling and bombing” by Russian forces.Whatever aid Russia is giving is dwarfed by the destruction its illegal invasion has caused. And Russian forces have shelled aid workers, ambulances and fleeing civilians.CNN reported that Russia had conducted “double-tap” strikes against first emergency services – “[h]itting a target, waiting a few minutes for the first responders to arrive, and then hitting the same spot again.”That fits into a broader pattern of attacks on civilians and infrastructure.Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations commissioner for human rights, told The Associated Press on April 22 that international humanitarian law had seemingly been “tossed aside” since Russia invaded on February 24.“Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure – actions that may amount to war crimes,” a statement from her office read.Attacks on health care facilities are systematic.The World Health Organization has documented more than 100 attacks on Ukraine’s health services as of April 7 – 89 targeting health facilities and 13 transport, including ambulances.Klimov’s claim that non-combatant Ukrainians are free to leave is contradicted by reports that civilians are being sent to filtration camps, where those suspected of Ukrainian government or independent media links have reportedly faced interrogation, torture and even murder.Russia has accused Ukrainian forces of shelling humanitarian aid and refugee convoys. Those claims have not been independently verified, and while they should be investigated, Russian state media reports are compromised by a complete lack of press freedom and fealty to the Kremlin.“Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, almost all independent [Russian] media have been banned, blocked and/or declared ‘foreign agents’,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.Other media outlets “are subject to military censorship.”;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-more-putin-disinfo-bizarre-claim-about-ukrainian-nukes/31723522.html,https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%203007/Part/volume-3007-I-52241.pdf,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/24/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-announces-new-humanitarian-development-and-democracy-assistance-to-ukraine-and-the-surrounding-region/,https://www.unocha.org/ukraine,https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-food-agency-says-war-in-ukraine-will-lead-to-worst-food-crisis-since-world-war-ii/6507466.html,https://www.unocha.org/ukraine,https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/eu-solidarity-ukraine/eu-assistance-ukraine_en,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61151045,https://www.unocha.org/story/ukraine-needs-grow-un-seeks-us225-billion,https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Ukraine%20Flash%20Appeal%202022.pdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/health/aid-convoy-ukraine-deaths.html,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ambulances-in-ukraine-have-become-targets-in-russian-invasion-say/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/02/ukraine-russian-forces-fired-civilian-vehicles,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/25/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-paramedics-intl/index.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-united-nations-war-crimes-michelle-bachelet-7f9bb2c28a8b4060f0bd3150aeb7201c,https://www.who.int/news/item/07-04-2022-who-records-100th-attack-on-health-care-in-ukraine,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-filtration-camps-osce/31825625.html,https://tass.com/emergencies/1437467?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google.com&utm_referrer=google.com,https://rsf.org/en/country/russia;Russia Creates Ukraine Disaster, Then Claims Credit For ‘Humanitarian’ Aid;;;;;;

(Stefan Wermuth/Reuters)The Panchen Lama is Tibetan Buddhism’s second-most important figure.Three days later, the Chinese government, hoping to select its own Panchen Lama, kidnapped Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family. Their whereabouts have never been disclosed.On April 25, which was Gedhun Choekyi Nyima’s 33rd birthday, the State Department condemned the Chinese government for continuing “to deny members of the Tibetan community access to the Dalai Lama-designated Panchen Lama” and urged Beijing to free him.The State Department said the U.S. supports “Tibetans’ right to select, educate, and venerate their own leaders, like the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, according to their own beliefs and without government interference.”Paramilitary police officers swap positions during a change of guard in front of Potala Palace in Lhasa, during a government-organized tour of the Tibet Autonomous Region on October 15, 2020. (Thomas Peter/Reuters)In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said his government “pursues policies of freedom of religious belief, including respecting and protecting the reincarnation of Living Buddhas.”He added: “Twenty-seven years ago, when he (the Dalai Lama) was abroad, he took the liberty of declaring a child as the reincarnation of the Panchen Erdeni in order to carry out anti-China separatist political hype to the detriment of religious rituals and in disregard of historical conventions.” (Erdeni is a special title given to the Panchen Lama by Qing Emperors.)That is misleading. In fact, the Dalai Lama holds the authority to recognize the Panchen Lama, according to Tibetan Buddhist traditions.The rituals and conventions Wang accused the Dalai Lama of disregarding include the so-called “Golden Urn ceremony,” a Qing Dynasty law mandating that reincarnations of prominent Tibetan Buddhist monks be selected by drawing lots from a container.Tibetans had followed that law sporadically until the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) enforced it in 1995. Beijing rigged the ceremony to put forward a Panchen Lama of its choice, who remains rejected by most Tibetans.Tibetan “reincarnation”The practice of finding the “reincarnation” of tulkus, or “living buddhas” who are reincarnated custodians of a specific lineage of Buddhist teachings, is a unique feature of Tibetan Buddhism.The practice dates to the 13th century and has been used to solve the question of succession of tulkus, wrote Datta Karubaki, professor of Himalayan studies at the University of North Bengal.Tibetan pilgrims pray outside the Jokhang Temple in the early morning in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, September 14, 2016. (EPA)For centuries, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, both high-profile tulkus, have been regarded as the two most important spiritual leaders of the dominant Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.Until 2011, when the Dalai Lama decided to give up his political role in the Tibetan government-in-exile and shift that power to an elected representative, Tibet was the only regime in the world where a Buddhist monk, the Dalai Lama, served as the head of government.According to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, once a lama dies, a search for his reincarnation begins.“Sometimes the lamas themselves leave directions regarding rebirth in order to help the fellow monks to pursue their search,” wrote Karubaki.""Sometimes the previous generation of lamas wrote down where my next generation was born and what the person was like,"" Elliot Sperling, a historian of Tibet and Tibetan-Chinese relations at Indiana University, told the Voice of America (VOA) in 2016.The 14th Dalai Lama lecturing Buddhism in Dharamsala, India, September 11, 2016. (Irina Zueva/Courtesy Photo)“In the absence of such directions, they resort either to astrologers or an oracle, who points out in vague and obscure terms, the direction and the place where investigations must be made as well as the various signs by which the child must be identified,” Karubaki wrote. “Signs are also found in the waters of some sacred lakes which are interpreted as guidelines.”Search teams are sent to find children born around the date of the lama’s death who match the signs. They are put through a series of tests until the right one is divined. While most Dalai Lamas were found in Tibet, the 4th Dalai Lama was found in Mongolia and the 6th in India.Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, told VOA in 2016: ""These are the ways that have been passed on. There are many ways to verify it (the reincarnated), such as observing dreams or observing the color and burning time of the butter lamp, or with the help of some objects, like the rosary, and plus meditation. Thoughts, feelings…It's not just one factor.""The Dalai Lama gestures before speaking to students during a talk at Mumbai University in this February 18, 2011. (Danish Siddiqui/Reuters)The 14th Dalai Lama said there had been a long tradition of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama recognizing each other’s reincarnation. The 10th Panchen Lama said the same thing.The ‘Golden Urn’In 1995, however, the Chinese government resurrected the Golden Urn ceremony to install the 11th Panchen Lama of their choice rather than recognize Gedhun Choekyi Nyima.“The rationale for the dismissal of the Dalai Lama’s choice, according to the Chinese government, was his disregard for traditional practices in the recognition of high incarnations,” Sperling wrote in a 2012 article for Studies on the History and Literature of Tibet and the Himalaya.“It goes without saying that the underlying — albeit, quite obvious — reason was the need for the Chinese government to retain control over the structure and content of the Buddhist apparatus insofar as what are perceived as state interests were concerned.”“The Chinese Communist Party hoped to limit the ability of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile to independently identify reincarnations,"" says the publisher’s description of historian Max Oidtmann’s book Forging the Golden Urn. ""In so doing, they elevated a long-forgotten ceremony into a controversial symbol of Chinese sovereignty in Tibet.”Li Jianglin, an independent writer and researcher of Tibetan history, told VOA in 2016 that the Tibetan government had always tried to avoid using the Golden Urn ceremony.""Because they never genuinely accepted it, because it was not something of Tibetan Buddhism itself. It was imposed on them for political control by another regime,"" she said.A rejected selectionDuring its “Great Leap Forward” campaign in 1958, the Chinese communist regime, whose leader deemed religion ""poison,"" vowed to abolish the reincarnation system in Tibet. But shortly after the 10th Panchen Lama’s sudden death in 1989, China began to lead the search for his reincarnation.Tenth Panchen Lama in 1988According to Arjia Rinpoche, the former abbot of Kumbum Monastery who now lives in exile in the United States (Rinpoche is a Tibetan honorific term used for abbots of Buddhist monasteries and other revered spiritual teachers), Beijing made Chadrel Rinpoche the leader of the search team. Chadrel Rinpoche was abbot of the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and regarded by Beijing as “politically competent.”Yet, Chadrel Rinpoche insisted that only the Dalai Lama, the supreme spiritual leader of Tibet, had the power to decide the next Panchen Lama and threatened to quit the search team.Through a messenger, Chadrel Rinpoche secretly contacted the 14th Dalai Lama in exile in India, sending pictures and other information about a group of Panchen Lama candidates that the search team had found.In January 1995, the Dalai Lama confirmed Gedhun Choekyi Nyima to be the 11th Panchen Lama, but Beijing refused to accept the candidate and insisted on using the Golden Urn ceremony.On May 14, 1995, Chadrel Rinpoche was detained in Chengdu and placed under house arrest. He was sentenced to six years in prison in 1997 on charges of “colluding with overseas separatist forces and revealing state secrets.”His whereabouts since the expiration of his sentence in 2002 are unknown.On May 16, 1995, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that it would not recognize Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the next Panchen Lama. The next day, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family were taken by the Chinese authorities and have not been seen since.And a rigged selectionOn November 29, 1995, under Beijing’s direction, the Golden Urn ceremony was held in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, Tibet. Gyaincain Norbu, a 5-year-old boy whose parents were Chinese Communist Party members, won the lottery to become the 11th Panchen Lama.However, according to Arjia Rinpoche, who attended the ceremony, the lottery was manipulated.On the flight back to Beijing, he heard Ye Xiaowen, then head of China’s State Administration for Religious Affairs, tell other officials that they made the stick with Gyaincain Norbu’s name on it slightly longer by stuffing cotton in it. That stick was chosen, he said.According to “Why Tibet Is Burning,” published by the Tibetan Policy Institute in 2013, Arjia Rinpoche said the Chinese government had forced him “to play a part in the selection of the 11th Panchen Lama.”The Chinese government-appointed 11th Panchen Lama, center, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), greets other delegates at the opening session of the CPPCC in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, China, Monday, March 3, 2014. (Ng Han Guan/AP)“I was an eyewitness to the fact that the ritual was a farce and that the selection was rigged,” he said. “It was totally manipulated.”After being confirmed by Beijing, the 11th Panchen Lama never returned to Tibet. He was permanently placed in a mansion in Beijing and was later married to a Han Chinese woman.";https://www.state.gov/on-the-occasion-of-the-panchen-lamas-33rd-birthday/,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202204/t20220426_10674075.html,http://cup.columbia.edu/book/forging-the-golden-urn/9780231184069,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/243143/bot_2000_01-03_01.pdf?sequence=1,https://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134432801/Dalai-Lama-To-Give-Up-Political-Role-In-Tibet,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/243143/bot_2000_01-03_01.pdf?sequence=1,https://elliotsperling.org/reincarnation-and-the-golden-urn-in-the-19th-century-the-recognition-of-the-8th-panchen-lama/,https://www.amazon.com/Studies-History-Literature-Tibet-Himalaya/dp/9937506794,http://cup.columbia.edu/book/forging-the-golden-urn/9780231184069,https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-393-04969-5,https://tibet.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Why-Tibet-is-Burning...pdf;China’s False History, Manipulation of Tibetan Buddhism;;;;;;
82;;;;False;Russian Defense Ministry;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-azovstal-russia-false/6743360.html;Russia’s False Claims About Azovstal Evacuation;2022-05-02;polygraph;;On May 1, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in the city of Mariupol had begun.The ministry claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin had initiated the evacuation and that Ukrainian troops in the plant were holding the civilians as hostages:“Thanks to President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin’s initiative, 80 civilians, including women and children, held by the Ukrainian nationalists have been rescued from the territory of the Azovstal factory in Mariupol.”Those claims are false.The evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant was initiated by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who proposed the plan to Putin at a meeting in Moscow on April 26.According to the U.N., Putin “agreed in principle” to allow the U.N. and the International Red Cross to participate in the rescue of the Ukrainians trapped at Azovstal.The U.N.-negotiated safe corridors are meant to give the evacuees the choice of whether to be transported to Ukraine-controlled territory or to the Russian-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.Russia does not give evacuees that choice but sends people to so-called filtration camps in Donbas to be deported to rural areas in Russia.Guterres also met with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to negotiate the conditions for a humanitarian corridor, and then traveled to Kyiv to finalize the deal with the Ukrainian side, already desperate to save the people at Azovstal.So, contrary to the Russian Defense Ministry’s claim, Putin did not initiate the evacuation – Guterres did.Just a day after hosting the secretary general in Moscow, the Russian military hit Ukraine’s capital with multiple cruise missile strikes while Guterres was visiting in Kyiv.At the same time, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed the “Ukrainian nationalists” at Azovstal were holding civilians against their will, Russian state TV aired video of men and women claiming to be refugees from Azovstal and accusing the Ukrainian forces of keeping them in cages and not letting them leave. Those reports did not explain how the purported hostages escaped or why the Ukrainian troops let them go.The Azovstal defenders are mostly remnants of Ukraine’s Azov Battalion and the 36th Marine Brigade. The Azov Battalion, in a post on its Telegram channel, described the civilians in the catacombs as “our wives, children and parents,” saying they chose to stay with the troops to escape possible violence or death at the hands of Russian troops, or deportation to Russia.They posted photographs and video to support their statement.Video from the inside of Azovstal plant verified by the Reuters news agency showed the Azov battalion servicemen helping civilians make their way to the surface through the thick layer of rubble and ruins caused by Russian bombardment.Citing one of the rescued civilians, Natalia Usmanova, Reuters reported on May 1 that the Russian bombing was so intense that the people in the Azovstal tunnels were terrified the bunkers would not withstand it. “We did not see the sun for so long,” Usmanova said, recalling the lack of fresh air, food and water.Russia besieged Mariupol during the first days of war in early March, claiming full control over the coastal city a month later, except for the Azovstal plant, which remains the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance.About 2,000 Ukrainian civilians and troops reportedly used the Azovstal plant’s vast underground labyrinths to shelter from the Russian bombardment.Ukrainian authorities estimate that 20,000 Ukrainian civilians and servicemen have died in the Mariupol fighting. What appear to be mass burial sites are visible in satellite images released by the Maxar Group in late April.On May 2, the evacuation of civilians through the U.N.-negotiated corridors stalled after Russia resumed bombing, Reuters reported.

83;;;;False;Sergei Naryshkin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-poland-conspiracy-ukraine-land-grab/6743359.html;Russian Spy Chief Falsely Claims Poland Wants Ukrainian Territory;2022-04-29;polygraph;;On April 28, the director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Naryshkin, spun a conspiracy theory about Polish designs on Ukraine.Without evidence, Naryshkin claimed the United States and Poland are working to restore Polish control over its “historical possessions” in Ukraine.The intelligence service, known as the SVR, issued this statement:“As stated by the director of the SVR, S.E. Naryshkin: ‘According to information received by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Washington and Warsaw are working on plans to establish Poland’s tight military-political control over “its historical possessions” in Ukraine.’”It further quoted Naryshkin, claiming the first step would come with Polish troops entering western Ukraine under the pretext of protecting it from Russia.“Currently, the modalities of the upcoming mission are being discussed with the Biden administration,” the SVR quoted Naryshkin as saying. “According to preliminary agreements, it will take place without a NATO mandate, but with the participation of ‘willing states.’ Warsaw has not yet been able to agree with the potential participants of the ‘coalition of like-minded people.’ ”Naryshkin said Polish forces would be deployed to parts of the country where the risk of encountering Russian troops are minimal.The Polish government dismissed the unfounded accusations as disinformation.“The lies about Poland's alleged plans to attack western Ukraine have been repeated for several years,” Reuters quoted Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for Poland's special services coordinator, as saying.“The aim of Russian propaganda is to foster distrust between Ukraine and Poland to undermine PL-UA cooperation.”Separately, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council and former director of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), claimed that the policies of the West could lead to the disintegration of Ukraine.Speaking to the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Patrushev accused the United States of trying to “suppress Russia” and divide “a single people” by “using their proteges in Kyiv” to create an opposition force to Russia.Commenting on Patrushev’s statement, Sergei Tsekov, a member of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia’s parliament, said that the collapse of Ukraine “has already taken place.”Tsekov cited Russia’s recognition of two self-proclaimed Russia-backed breakaway provinces in eastern Ukraine, Russia’s Izvestia newspaper reported.Tsekov claimed Ukraine is not far from being like Nazi Germany and said “the nationalist, Nazi system” never brought benefits, but “always destroyed countries.”Led by President Vladimir Putin’s false claims, Russian propaganda has tried to justify its war as an effort of emancipation and “de-Nazification.” There is no evidence to back up that portrayal, and much evidence that Putin is projecting. After annexing Crimea in 2014 and fomenting conflict in eastern Ukraine for eight years, Russia is reportedly preparing to absorb the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic into the Russian Federation.In his comments, Naryshkin said allied powers accepted Poland’s annexation of western Ukraine after World War I. But unlike the Russian Federation, the modern Polish state has not pursued revanchist policies against Ukraine.Poland was the first foreign country to recognize Ukraine’s independence in December 1991.The previous year, Poland and Ukraine agreed to the “Declaration on the foundations and general directions in the development of Polish-Ukrainian relations.”Article 3 of the declaration states that neither country has, nor will, pursue territorial claims against the other.From left to right: Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Latvian President Egils Levits and Estonian President Alar Karis during a meeting in Kyiv on April 13, 2022. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP)Poland has been on the “front line of helping Ukraine” by providing weapons and humanitarian support, and accepting refugees, following Russia’s February 24 invasion, said U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.While Russian officials accuse the West and even the Ukrainian themselves of bringing about Ukraine’s destruction, it is Russia’s policy, which some argue constitutes genocide, that is seeking Ukraine’s dismemberment.Days before launching the war, Putin argued that Ukraine is not even a real country, falsely claiming that Ukraine’s government is fascist. Putin called Ukraine part of Russia’s “own history, culture, spiritual space.”Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Moscow on April 26, 2022. (Vladimir Astapkovich/Sputnik/Kremlin/Reuters)Russian forces have indiscriminately bombarded populated areas, killing civilians and destroying hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure.U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said those actions may have been war crimes.She also said “[t]he scale of summary executions of civilians in areas previously occupied by Russian forces are also emerging.”One such atrocity in the town of Bucha allegedly saw hundreds of civilians systematically killed.Putin has called the Bucha killings a provocation or fake, while also awarding military honors to the Russian forces suspected of carrying out the atrocities.“Russian practice of mass killing, rape, and deportation, the claim that a nation does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it,” Yale history professor Timothy Snyder wrote in The New Yorker magazine.Snyder noted that Poles, “whose ancestors were the chief victims of Ukrainian nationalism, have admitted nearly three million Ukrainian refugees.”That, he wrote, demonstrates “there are other ways to handle history than stories of eternal victimhood.”Numerous reports say Moscow is forcibly deporting Ukrainians to Russia, a violation of the Geneva conventions.Moscow has also been accused of “kidnapping” Ukrainian children and sending them to Russia, where they allegedly face the prospect of illegal adoption.During the Second World War, Nazi Germany kidnapped tens of thousands of children, many of them Polish, and forcibly “Germanized” them.;https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-spy-chief-says-us-poland-plotting-division-ukraine-2022-04-28/,https://iz.ru/1326587/2022-04-26/v-sovbeze-rf-predrekli-raspad-ukrainy-na-neskolko-gosudarstv,https://rg.ru/2022/04/26/patrushev-itogom-politiki-zapada-i-kieva-mozhet-stat-raspad-ukrainy-na-neskolko-gosudarstv.html,https://iz.ru/1327611/2022-04-28/varshava-i-vashington-obsuzhdaiut-plan-po-vossoedineniiu-polshi-s-zapadnoi-ukrainoi,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html,https://news.yahoo.com/may-russians-preparing-referendums-annexation-161602263.html,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revanchist,https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/9308299,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/poland-foreign-secretarys-statement-to-warsaw-press-conference,https://www.npr.org/2022/04/18/1093206883/speaking-of-genocide-biden-escalates-the-war-of-words-over-ukraine,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-s-fraudulent-foundations-for-attacking-ukraine/31746831.html,https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/04/bachelet-urges-respect-international-humanitarian-law-amid-growing-evidence,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61185469?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=6263e42d77811a20d37c9562%26Bucha%20counts%20toll%20of%20Russian%20occupation%262022-04-23T11%3A39%3A03.068Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:4d1cadc5-17ab-4c6c-bc1a-b879aefab0d3&pinned_post_asset_id=6263e42d77811a20d37c9562&pinned_post_type=share,https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/putin-denies-russian-military-committed-war-crimes-in-mariupol-and-bucha/,https://www.voanews.com/a/german-intel-claims-intercepts-show-russians-discussing-killing-ukrainian-civilians/6519448.html,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/genocide-in-ukraine-putin-just-gave-his-tacit-approval-for-more-war-crimes/,https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/the-war-in-ukraine-is-a-colonial-war?fbclid=IwAR259kT9jWbgCsDl91IFfoYxqkBbdvW3cnjwCgAVFjqmaViyrUwBsYUk4zY,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscow-has-deported-500000-people-russia-ukraine-lawmaker-says-2022-04-20/,https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2022/04/laurie-blank-russia-invasion-ukraine-genocide/,https://www.dw.com/en/the-children-the-nazis-stole-in-poland-forgotten-victims/a-52739589;Russian Spy Chief Falsely Claims Poland Wants Ukrainian Territory;;;;;;
84;;;;Misleading;Sergiy Korsunsky;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukraine-japan-hitohito-second-world-war/6743357.html;Sorting Out Ukraine, Hirohito and the Poisonous Legacy of WWII;2022-04-27;polygraph;;"On April 1, the Ukrainian government posted a video to Twitter about the “ideology of contemporary ruscism,” which it described as “a mixture of all Russian imperial ideologies.”The video aimed to counter Moscow’s claims that its war aims to “de-nazify Ukraine.” The implication is that Russia itself has become a totalitarian state.The video states: “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.” And it shows photos of Nazi Germany’s leader Adolf Hitler, Italy’s fascist leader Benito Mussolini, and imperial Japan’s wartime leader Hirohito (Emperor Showa after his death).The Japanese government objected, as did Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan.On April 24, Masahisa Sato, director of the foreign affairs division of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said on Twitter that he had asked Japan’s Foreign Ministry to take “immediate action” over the video.Japan’s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki later told reporters:""It is utterly inappropriate to treat Emperor Showa in the same way as Hitler and Mussolini. It's extremely regrettable.”Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan, concurred.“This shot uses a photograph of the Emperor of Japan, who had nothing to do with the outbreak of war and fascist ideology. The Japanese are very offended because it is not fair and does not correspond to historical facts. We urge you to correct. [Japan] is one of our greatest allies,” he tweeted. To say Hirohito had nothing to do with the outbreak of war, however, is misleading.Ukraine’s government nonetheless apologized for the video, reposting it to Twitter on April 24 with the image of Hirohito deleted.Japan’s aid to Ukraine, including nonlethal military equipment, is seen as unprecedented for a country whose constitution outlaws war. That incentivizes Kyiv to not offend Tokyo.But was Ukraine wrong to compare Hirohito to Hitler and Mussolini?In fact, debate continues over what fascism actually means and whether imperial Japan could be described as fascist.Robert Paxton, a Columbia University professor and fascism expert, argued that imperial Japan is better understood as “an expansionist military dictatorship with a high degree of state-sponsored mobilization,” rather than “a fascist regime.”David Ambaras, a professor of history at North Carolina State University who researches the social history of modern Japan and its empire, has argued otherwise.“Informed scholars understand fascism to be a mobile assemblage of ideologies and political and aesthetic practices centered on the valorization of empire, war, and the nation, along with a nominal rhetorical anticapitalism,” he tweeted.“Japan clearly was part of this system; fascism intensified its imperialism and militarism.”But that may be hairsplitting.Regardless of how fascism is defined, and whether the label applies to imperial Japan, its past militarism and war crimes are facts of historical record.Imperial Japan was allied with Hitler’s Germany and fascist Italy during the Second World War.Hirohito was the head of state during Japan's campaign of imperial expansion, including the Japanese army’s 1931 seizure of Manchuria (mostly in northeast China), which some historians consider the true start of the war.Japan’s national charter at the time stated that “[t]he Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution.”Japan invaded, occupied and/or carried out campaigns of systematic violence and cultural suppression against most of its neighbors. Imperial Japanese massacres, atrocities and forced labor killed millions across the Asia-Pacific region.What role Hirohito played in this is debated. A bigger player was Hideki Tojo, the general and prime minister during World War II who was central to Japan’s expansionist policies and war effort. Tojo ultimately was executed for war crimes.A number of netizens wrote that Tojo, not Hirohito, should have appeared in the Ukraine video.Others, like Amy Stanley, a social historian of early modern and modern Japan at Northwestern University, argues that inclusion of Hirohito or Tojo in the video would have been problematic for Japanese nationalists.When Hirohito’s official biography was released in 2014, an Associated Press report noted “the emperor was criticized for letting himself be used as a spiritual symbol for Japanese militarism,” but added, “[M]ost historians portray him as largely a powerless figurehead.”A separate Associated Press report noted that “Hirohito’s role in World War II was never firmly established, as he was shielded from indictment in the Tokyo war crimes trials by a U.S. occupation that wanted to use him as a symbol to rebuild Japan.”Yet, prominent historians say Hirohito was no innocent. Among them is Herbert P. Bix, whose biography on Hirohito won a Pulitzer Prize.“[Hirohito] was never a puppet,” Bix wrote. “He failed to prevent his army from invading Manchuria in 1931, which caused Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations, but he sanctioned the full-scale invasion of China in 1937, which moved Japan into a state of total war.“He exercised close control over the use of chemical weapons in China and sanctioned the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Even after the war, when a new, American-modeled Constitution deprived him of sovereignty, he continued to meddle in politics.”For varying reasons, others agree.Japanese historian Akira Fujiwara argued the belief that the Emperor could not have reversed Japanese cabinet decisions “is a myth fabricated after the war.”Historian Peter Wetzler said Fujiwara did not present “enough evidence to document this conclusion,” but argues that Hirohito’s role in shaping imperial army and navy plans “emphatically supports” Fujiwara’s claim.Picture released on August 1945 of Japanese soldiers laying down arms in front of Soviet officers. (AFP)A memo by an imperial Japanese official that surfaced in 2018 supported the view that Hirohito was at least partially responsible for starting the war.That memo suggested the idea that Hirohito feared starting a war was exaggerated and that his unwavering support for the government’s decision to abandon diplomacy encouraged Tojo.Takahisa Furukawa, a Nihon University expert on wartime history, described Tojo as a “bureaucrat who was incapable of making [his] own decisions.” That led him to turn to Hirohito “as his supervisor.”“That’s why he had to report everything for the emperor to decide. If the emperor didn’t say no, then he would proceed,” Furukawa told the Associated Press.Contemporary Japan continues to struggle with its past.Japan has been at loggerheads with its wartime victims, particularly China, for attempts to downplay the military’s involvement in forced sexual slavery, whose victims are described as “comfort” women, as well as the scope of atrocities committed during the Nanjing massacre.Moreover, Ukraine has its own troubled history with fascism during the war.One prominent and controversial Ukrainian figure, Stepan Bandera, led a nationalist movement for Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union. Bandera cooperated with Nazi Germany at the beginning of the war but was later arrested by the German Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp.Some within Ukraine view Bandera as a freedom fighter, while others see him as a Nazi alley who's organization, the Order of Ukrainian Nationalists, carried out massacres against Poles and Jews.Clarification: This fact check has been edited to clarify Amy Stanley's position that inclusion of Hirohito or Tojo in the video would have been problematic for Japanese nationalists.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-purge-fascism-nazism/31760050.html,https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220425/p2a/00m/0na/020000c,https://www.voanews.com/a/more-assertive-japan-stands-up-to-russia-over-ukraine-/6490715.html,https://www.livescience.com/57622-fascism.html,https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-15-what-shall-be-done-about-japan-after-victory-(1945)/why-did-japan-choose-war,https://history.hanover.edu/texts/1889con.html,https://www.history.com/news/japan-colonization-korea,https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTM,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/world/asia/before-pearl-harbor-japans-emperor-cautioned-against-war-with-us-documents-show.html,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/emperor-hirohito-didn-t-want-to-provoke-u-s-in-1941-biography-claims-1.2760256,https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/herbert-p-bix,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/opinion/hirohito-string-puller-not-puppet.html,https://apnews.com/article/japan-ap-top-news-world-war-ii-international-news-attack-on-pearl-harbor-fb3c3334dc0a448ea838599f30d9a35a,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-comfort-women-japan-textbooks/31460270.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre_denial,https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/05/20/312719066/hero-or-villain-historical-ukrainian-figure-symbolizes-todays-feud;Sorting Out Ukraine, Hirohito and the Poisonous Legacy of WWII;;;;;;
85;;;;False;Abdul Hadi bin Awang;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-malaysia-ukraine-zionist-conspiracy/6743346.html;False: Ukraine War a Plot To Entice Jews to Israel;2022-04-12;polygraph;;To justify its illegal invasion of Ukraine, Russian propaganda has long painted its neighbor – falsely – as a fascist state that needs to be “de-nazified.”Recently, a prominent Malaysian politician sympathetic to Russia took the opposite approach, accusing Ukraine of being a “Zionist” puppet.In an April 7 Facebook post, Abdul Hadi bin Awang, president of the Malaysian Islamic Party and the Malaysian Prime Minister’s special envoy for the Middle East, baselessly claimed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is part of a Zionist plot to get Jewish Ukrainians to settle in Israel.Abdul Hadi accused Zionists of “causing chaos [across] the whole world,” clandestinely colonizing other countries and forming “proxies to engage in warfare directly through leaders who were tools or by subtle provocations.”“Most recently, Ukraine became an established Zionist base, as 40 percent of its citizens were Zionists or Jews despite the real, hidden statistics. Most of [Israel’s leaders] come from Ukraine or surrounding countries such as Poland, Hungary, Austria and others,” Abdul Hadi said.“Now, the Zionists have succeeded in appointing a new head of state of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from among the Jews and hardcore Zionists. In his statement, Zelenskyy mentioned that the state of Ukraine needs to be saved like the state of Israel, thus making the allegations clear and obvious.”Image posted to Abdul Hadi bin Awang's Facebook page on April 7, 2022, which accompanied a text spreading anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Ukraine.Abdul Hadi claimed Ukrainians have received better treatment as refugees than “war victims in West Asia and Africa” due to “how strong the Zionist influence is on European countries and their allies.”He compared “provocations” by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler’s incitement of World War II.Echoing false Kremlin claims, he said NATO expansion “was an act of provocation that forced Russia to launch an initial attack to save its country.”Abdul Hadi then made this bogus claim:“[Ukrainian Jews] did not respond to the Zionist call for them to emigrate to the state of Israel to strengthen the struggle of the Supreme State of Israel as the sole aspiring superpower at the end of time. Thus, the war that took place wisely forced them to migrate to Israel.”The idea that Zionists are behind Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine to prompt Ukraine’s Jewish population to emigrate to Israel is absurdly false, as is the claim that 40 percent of Ukraine’s citizens are “Zionists or Jews.”According to some estimates, Jews represent at most 1 percent of Ukraine’s population. And while a recent survey showed Ukrainians generally have favorable attitudes toward Israel, that does not necessarily mean they are Zionists, that is, supporters of the movement for Jewish people to have a homeland in the Land of Israel and the region of Palestine.Even support for the existence of the state of Israel does not necessary correlate to support for the status quo, which Amnesty International and others have described as a policy of apartheid against Palestinians.However, criticism of Zionism goes beyond support for Palestinian rights. It also crosses over into antisemitic conspiracy theory, including, as Abdul Hadi’s comments imply, the belief that Jews somehow secretly control Western governments.Abdul Hadi also drastically overestimated the size of Ukraine’s Jewish population.In 2016, the Institute for Jewish Policy Research estimated that the “core Jewish population” of Ukraine at 56,000 or 0.13 percent of the country’s total population. The World Population Review puts the number of Ukrainian Jews at 43,000.The European Jewish Congress estimates that Ukraine’s Jewish population is 400,000, or less than 1 percent of Ukraine’s total population. That figure has been contested, however, and there are reasonable explanations for discrepancies in the population estimates.Writing in the Jewish Chronicle, Jonathan Boyd of the London-based Jewish Policy Research Institute noted that the religious aspects of Judaism were “strongly suppressed in the Soviet Union,” while Yiddish culture was “all but destroyed after the Second World War.”That, he said, left Soviet Jews with “an extremely limited knowledge of Jewish religion or culture, able only to be identified as Jews by nationality or to affirm their Jewishness on the grounds of being part of a minority group with common ancestry.”According to Boyd, multiple criteria are used to determine who is and who is not Jewish. About 45,000 people in Ukraine self-identify as religiously or ethnically Jewish, he said, adding that if you include those with at least one Jewish parent who do not identify as Jewish, the figure grows to 90,000.Ukraine’s “enlarged” Jewish population – including those living in Jewish households who might not even be Jewish – is 140,000.Taking into account people eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, which includes anyone who is the descendent of at least one Jewish grandparent and their immediate family members (regardless of whether they are Jewish or not) – brings Ukraine’s total Jewish population to 200,000.Thus, the estimate that Ukraine’s Jewish population is 400,000 is “way off,” Boyd argued in his piece for the Jewish Chronicle.After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Israel did encourage Ukrainian Jews to immigrate to Israel. On March 24, the Times of Israel said 6,000 Ukrainians did so. The newspaper did not explicitly state whether those individuals qualified to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return.Some 500,000 of Israel’s 9.5 million citizens have Ukrainian heritage.Still, the idea that Israel would clandestinely drive Russia to invade Ukraine to attract, at most, 200,000 Ukrainian refugees to resettle there, strains credulity.And while Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish, he was elected by Ukraine’s overwhelmingly non-Jewish population. The claim that he was “appointed” by Zionists is baseless.Zelenskyy has drawn criticism for expressing sympathy for Israelis targeted in Palestinian rocket attacks.Zelenskyy also drew criticism, and not only from Abdul Hadi, for a March 22 speech before Israel’s legislature. In it, the Ukrainian president said: “We are in different countries and in completely different conditions. But the threat is the same: for both us and you – the total destruction of the people, state, culture. And even of the names: Ukraine, Israel.”However, in that speech, which the Times of Israel described as “scathing,” Zelenskyy cited the Holocaust and other tragedies to upbraid Israel for failing to arm Ukraine or take in more refugees. He also lambasted Israel for not following the lead of other Western nations and instituting harsh sanctions against Russia. Zelenskyy and others have called Russia’s actions in Ukraine genocide.His personal views on Israel aside, Zelenskyy was making a rhetorical appeal to get more support for Ukraine’s war effort. He had specifically pushed Israel to share its Iron Dome air defense system with Ukraine. In order not to hurt relations with Russia, Israel had previously stopped the United States from delivering several batteries of the system to Ukraine.This shows that Ukraine and Israel have separate and independent foreign policies.Ukraine has also criticized Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories.In December 2016, Ukraine was one of the 14 Security Council members to vote for a resolution stating that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.”While Zelenskyy was not president at that time, Ukraine then had a Jewish prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman.Israel’s then prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, canceled a visit with Groysman over that vote.Former Prime Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Hroysman (R) and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Kyiv on August 20, 2019. (kmu.gov.ua)Ukraine’s foreign ministry at the time said the country had experienced the tragic consequences of violations of international law — a reference to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and clandestine war in eastern Ukraine.While Malaysia joined 140 other countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Southeast Asian country opted not to impose unilateral sanctions against Russia.Political analysts in Malaysia said “pro-Moscow messaging” had widely shaped Malaysian public opinion about Russia, the South China Morning Post reported.They said anti-Western sentiment in the Muslim-majority country, fueled by the view that the United States has treated Palestinians and Muslims elsewhere unfairly in the post 9/11 era, also spurred that sentiment.Similar trends have been observed in neighboring Indonesia.;https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=de-nazification&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.jpost.com/international/article-689678,https://www.voanews.com/a/amnesty-international-report-accuses-israel-of-apartheid-/6422236.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory,https://www.jpr.org.uk/country?id=344,https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/jewish-population-by-country,https://eurojewcong.org/communities/ukraine/,https://www.thejc.com/lets-talk/all/ukraines-jewish-population-will-only-decline-from-here-1Bu1L210y9huXXrU4uQyYY,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-boyd-b5b81135/,https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/return.htm,https://www.dw.com/en/ukrainian-jews-seek-refuge-in-israel/a-61212852,https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-6000-ukrainians-have-moved-to-israel-since-russia-invaded-double-2021s-total/,https://www.israel21c.org/for-israelis-the-outpouring-of-aid-to-ukraine-is-personal/,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/in-gaza-palestinians-with-ukraine-ties-watching-with-empathy-as-russian-attack-continues,https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/palestinians-slam-zelenskys-speech-knesset,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Speech_by_President_of_Ukraine_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_in_the_Knesset._(51951267719).jpg,https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-scathing-speech-zelensky-pleads-with-israel-to-prevent-russias-final-solution/,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-torpedoed-sale-of-iron-dome-to-ukraine-fearing-russian-reaction-report/,https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-cancels-visit-of-ukrainian-pm-after-kiev-supports-anti-settlements-resolution/,https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2022/03/776512/malaysia-supports-votes-favour-un-resolution-ukraine-crisis,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-rules-out-imposing-unilateral-sanctions-on-russia,https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/article/3171049/ukraine-war-battle-malaysias-social-media-propaganda-tool-russia-and?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article&campaign=3171049,https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3169708/chinese-internet-or-us-foreign-policy-why-some-indonesians;False: Ukraine War a Plot To Entice Jews to Israel;;;;;;
86;;;;Misleading;Issa Konfourou;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mali-wagner-moura/6743345.html;Locking Arms with Russians, Mali Denies Ethnic Massacre;2022-04-11;polygraph;;During a United Nations meeting on April 7 about the situation in Mali, Issa Konfourou, Mali’s ambassador to the U.N., denied allegations that government forces committed atrocities in the south-central Malian town of Moura.In late March, Malian troops and Russian mercenaries allegedly executed some 300 civilians during a counter-insurgency campaign against terrorist groups in Moura. Konfourou said his government would investigate and release the findings. He called on others not to call the incident a massacre or make accusations against the Malian armed forces.“The government is very committed to respect and making sure that human rights are respected by the national and international forces,” Konfourou said. That is misleading. Evidence exposed by New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the United Nations’ stabilization mission in Mali (MINUSMA) contradict his statement.On April 4, Col. Mariam Sagara, spokesman for the Malian armed forces, said the army had killed 200 Islamist militants and arrested 51 more in Moura during a special operation involving land and air forces.According to the Malian army, over the past several years, extremists have used Moura as a base from which to launch attacks in central and northern Mali. The Malian army said in a statement that it respects human rights and has conducted awareness-raising and training efforts, as well as launched investigations into all allegations of wrongdoing. But HRW reported on April 5 that Malian troops and foreign soldiers, who sources identified as Russian mercenaries, summarily executed 300 men during an operation in Moura. HRW said it interviewed 27 people, including witnesses, traders from the local market in the village, community leaders, foreign diplomats and security analysts. The majority of those killed were from the pastoralist Peuhl, or Fulani, ethnic group, which jihadist recruiters have targeted to exploit the group’s grievances against the government.Local residents told HRW they saw “scores of white, non-French-speaking armed men” they believed were Russians because the government previously said it had hired Russian “trainers.”Witnesses said Russian militia appeared to outnumber Malian soldiers, mainly in the first two days of the operation, when about 100 Russian troops and a number of Malian soldiers were air-dropped in the town. The Russian forces then blocked all exits.“Over the four days, the soldiers ordered the detained men in groups of 4, 6, or up to 10, to stand up and walk for between several dozen and several hundred meters. There, the Malian and foreign soldiers summarily executed them. The witnesses said some victims were shot in the head, while other groups of men were sprayed by gunfire,” the HRW report stated. The alleged killings in Moura were not the first such allegations in Mali identifying mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group and members of the Malian army. The Wagner Group is a Russian private military company (PMC) that analysts say has deep ties to the Russia military and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some have likened them to Putin’s “private army.” During the April 7 U.N. session, El Ghassim Wane, head of the U.N. Mali mission, called on government authorities to allow U.N. teams enter Moura and investigate.Wane said the mission has opened “17 investigations on allegations of indiscriminate attacks against civilians, extrajudicial arrests, mistreatment, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in central Mali since the beginning of this year.” Reports by HRW and France’s Le Monde newspaper published in mid-March cited Malians who said government and foreign troops detained and tortured them. They described the foreign troops as “white men speaking a strange language.” HRW said that the Malian army and terrorist groups have killed at least 107 civilians since December 2021. During this period, about a thousand Russian mercenaries arrived in Mali to support counter-terror operations, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported. On March 15, the Africa Report, a pan-African weekly magazine, said an unofficial U.N. report suggested the Malian army and Russian mercenaries were involved in the death of 30 people, including children, near the south-central Malian village of Dangere-Wotoro. Their charred, blindfolded and bound remains were found, and witnesses said they were executed and burned. It is believed that the victims were members of the Fulani ethnic group. “As for the perpetrators, there are reports that this incident was carried out by elements of the Malian Armed Forces, supported by members of the Russian private military company known as Wagner,” the report from the U.N. Mali mission said.The mission said that jihadists, armed militias and Mali's armed forces killed nearly 600 civilians in 2021. As of April 2021, more than 1,000 people, including soldiers, militants and at least 450 civilians, had been killed in Africa's Sahel region, which includes Mali, according to Rida Lyammouri of the Middle East Institute.In a March 2021 report on the Wagner Group in the Central African Republic, a U.N. working group on mercenaries described the Wagner Group as a shadowy network that “does not seem to have a legal existence, while operating in several countries across the globe.”“This web of enterprises shares, to different degrees, management and ownership structures, as well as personnel, and identifiers such as phone numbers, addresses and emails,” the U.N. report stated. Malian authorities have repeatedly denied the presence of mercenaries in Mali, contending only that Russian trainers are present.“We undertook no commitment of this nature,” Konfourou said during the April 7 U.N. session. “We have a fruitful cooperation relation with Russia, a state-to-state relation since 1960, and as a result of this cooperation with Russia, Mali continues to procure military materials needed for our security, and trainers and instructors from Russia are in Mali to train the forces how to use these materials acquired from Russia,” Konfourou said. The United States and the European Union have sanctioned the Wagner Group for destabilizing activities in various countries. The mercenary group has also been accused of war crimes. On April 10, Russia blocked a U.N. Security Council vote to create an independent mission to investigate the alleged massacre in Moura. Mali was one of the 17 African countries that abstained from voting in the U.N. General Assembly to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Mali is experiencing a political and security upheaval as it battles armed jihadist groups linked to Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaida in the Sahel region.

87;;;;Likely False;Eduard Basurin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-kramatorsk-missile/6743344.html;Suspect Claim by Russia on Rockets That Killed Fleeing Civilians;2022-04-09;polygraph;;"On April 8, 2022, the Ukrainian authorities and news reports said a rocket attack killed at least 52 people, including five children, on a railway station in the city of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine said Russian forces deliberately targeted the station, an evacuation hub for civilians fleeing the war, with two ballistic missiles. About 100 people were wounded, according to news reports and Ukrainian officials.Russia quickly denied responsibility and blamed Ukraine.""All statements by representatives of the Kyiv nationalist regime about the 'rocket attack' allegedly carried out by Russia on April 8 at the railway station in the city of Kramatorsk are a provocation and are absolutely untrue,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said, according to a report by The New York Times. As proof, the ministry claimed that only Ukrainian forces employ the Tochka-U ballistic missiles said to have been used in the strike.""We emphasize that Tochka-U tactical missiles, fragments of which were found near the Kramatorsk railway station and published by eyewitnesses, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces,"" the defense ministry claimed.A pro-Russian militia leader in the Donbas said the same thing. ""I underline, it's a rocket, Tochka-U, we don't have such a weaponry in our republics, Donetsk and Luhansk, and in the Russian Federation in the army they don't have it either,"" Eduard Basurin, deputy head of the Donetsk militia, told the Russian TV1 channel.This is likely false. Evidence shows that Russian convoys trucked Tochka-U systems into Belarus. And Russia reflexively blames Ukraine for attacks on civilians, no matter abundant evidence otherwise.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed the Kramatorsk attack on Russian-fired Tochka-U missiles. Also known as the SS-21, the Tochka is a mobile, single-warhead system that can launch in ballistic or cruise modes, according to a Center for Strategic International Studies Missile Threats report published in March. The weapons were developed in the 1970s by the Soviet Union.In 2018, the Russian defense ministry proudly advertised Tochka-U system in a YouTube video:""It is believed that Russia currently possesses 300 TEL [launch] vehicles and 310 nuclear warheads for all versions of the Tochka"" and that Ukraine has about 500 Tochka-U versions, a model introduced in 1989, the center reported.The Russian state-owned newspaper AIF reported in 2017 that the Russian army started using the Tochka-U in 1989. A website affiliated with the Russian armed forces, ""Voennoe Obozrenie,"" praised the Tochka-U system for reliability, comparing it with the Kalashnikov, Russia's famed automatic assault rifle.According to open-source reports, the Russian army has used Tochka-U missiles in Chechnya in the 1990s, in Syria, multiple times in Ukraine since the beginning of war in 2014 and including on the first day of its full-scale invasion February 24.On that day, the fragments of a rocket that hit a hospital in the village of Vugledar in eastern Ukraine, killing four and wounding more than 10 people, were identified as a Tochka-U system launched by the Russian army, according to the Twitter account Ukrainian Weapons Tracker.Ukraine has also reportedly used Tochka-U systems in Donbas in 2014 and in March under the new Russian offensive.An open-source investigative news site, the Belarusian Hajun project, twice published videos of Russian military columns marked with a letter ""V"" moving toward the Ukrainian border, on March 5 and March 30. The first column included ""at least 30"" and the second ""at least 8 Tochka-U"" systems, the site tweeted. Russia's deployment of about 30 Tochka-U systems to Belarusian borders near Ukraine also were reported by Telegram users on March 5.At the Kramatorsk strike, photos show a chunk of debris from a large rocket on which the words ""for children"" were written in Russian.Ukrainian authorities said about 4,000 people were awaiting evacuation at the station when the missiles hit on the morning of April 8.

88;;;;False;Liberal Democratic Party of Russia;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/6743343.html;Russian Pols to Make ‘Genocide’ Myth an Actual Law;2022-04-08;polygraph;;The United Nations voted on April 7 to suspend Russia from the world body’s Human Rights Council for the apparent atrocities by Russia’s troops in Ukraine.Meantime, the State Duma, or lower chamber of Russia’s parliament, is moving to turn the tables with a proposed law that would officially recognize “the genocide of ethnic Russians” by Ukraine – a myth that’s been widely debunked.Still, a law would perpetuate this long-running line of Kremlin disinformation meant to demonize Ukrainians. It would also solidify Russian President Vladimir Putin’s excuses for the war, give the Russia another tool to criminally prosecute those who oppose the war and further suppress independent news media.The ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) proposed the genocide legislation on April 4, the same day the world learned about a large number of civilian deaths in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb that Russian forces abandoned.Ukrainian forces and journalists reportedly found hundreds of corpses, some with signs of torture and execution or piled into mass graves. Russia denied its troops were involved and instead tried to blame Ukrainian security forces for what Western leaders and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zeleneskyy called war crimes.The LDPR-sponsored legislation states that, “Ukraine has been committing the crime of genocide against the Russian population for eight years.”The bill accuses the Ukrainian government of having taken steps beginning in 2014 toward the “physical destruction of the inhabitants” of the Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, contending that “the vast majority” of the residents of those Russia-backed separatist enclaves “belong to the Russian ethnographic group.”“Genocide of the Russian population is not limited to the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics,” it states.The claim of genocide is false, and the implication that Donetsk and Luhansk are Russian and not Ukrainian is an exaggeration.The legislation itself does not provide material evidence of the “genocide.” But its language misrepresents the United Nations’ statistics of casualties after the eight years of war in Donbas, as if these numbers mostly reflect mostly harm to the ethnic Russian population. Such interpretation is simply not true – in fact, the U.N. reports, cited in the bill, do not refer to the ethnicity of the casualties.There’s no doubt there were many in the war, which began after Russia illegally and forcefully annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.A month before the latest invasion began on February 24, the United Nations Office of Human Rights (OHCHR) reported the following statistics (notably without ethnic reference):“OHCHR estimates the total number of conflict-related casualties in Ukraine from 14 April 2014 to 31 December 2021 to be 51,000–54,0008: 14,200-14,400 killed (at least 3,404 civilians, estimated 4,400 Ukrainian forces, and estimated 6,500 members of armed groups), and 37-39,000 injured (7,000–9,000 civilians, 13,800–14,200 Ukrainian forces and 15,800-16,200 members of armed groups).”Moreover, after analyzing the proposed bill, the Russian Duma’s own legal department rejected its characterization of “genocide” as “incorrect,” saying that under United Nations conventions, “the classification of any actions as genocide could only be done by a competent court.”Over the years, Russian politicians, Russia-backed separatists and Russian state media have repeatedly made false claims of aggression by Ukraine. In fact, Russia instigated the war in Donbas virtually in tandem with the Crimea takeover.Russia then fed that conflict, providing military supplies and personnel – facts ignored by the proposed Duma law. A Russian missile system was implicated in the 2014 shoot down of a Malaysian airliner over Donbas, killing 298 aboard. The Kremlin made up multiple fake explanations and impeded efforts to investigate.Language in the Duma legislation attempts to pin blame solely on Ukraine for the deaths, casualties and displacement caused during the war in Donbas. Problem is, not only did Russia initiate and sustain the fighting, it has now expanded to an all-out war, attacking the capital of Kyiv and major cities outside Donbas, with an apparent strategy of targeting and terrorizing the civilian population.Casualty counts since Russia’s February invasion are unreliable given the ongoing fighting. The U.N. says more than 1,600 civilians, including 130 children, have died and another 2,300 have been injured.Ukraine says civilian casualties are far higher, and that hundreds died in Bucha and around Kyiv. The United States has estimated between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops deaths, while Ukraine has said it lost more than 1,300.On February 27, more than 300 scholars of genocide published a joint statement denouncing Russia’s claims against Ukraine, including President Vladimir Putin’s aim of “de-nazification,” as “cynical abuse of the term genocide” to “justify its unprovoked aggression”:“Russian propaganda has painted the Ukrainian state as Nazi and fascist ever since Russian special forces first entered Ukraine in 2014, annexing the Crimea and fomenting the conflict in the Donbas, which has smoldered for eight long years. It was propaganda in 2014. It remains propaganda today…”“This rhetoric is factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the (Soviet) Red Army.”;https://www.reuters.com/world/un-vote-suspending-russia-human-rights-council-over-ukraine-2022-04-07/,https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/99820-8,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-defending-ukraine-threat-putin-regurgitates-misleading-genocide-claim/31710603.html,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/07/world/ukraine-russia-war-news,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-intercepted-calls-with-russians-discussing-bucha-killings-der-spiegel-2022-04-07/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-bucha-denials-false/31787136.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/07/ukraine-russian-speakers/,https://www.vox.com/22970918/russia-war-in-ukraine-explained,https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Conflict-related%20civilian%20casualties%20as%20of%2031%20December%202021%20%28rev%2027%20January%202022%29%20corr%20EN_0.pdf,https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=donbas&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=mh17&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.polygraph.info/a/as-russia-walks-away-from-mh17-crash-talks-more-recycled-spin/30897286.html,https://www.vox.com/22970918/russia-war-in-ukraine-explained,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/world/europe/russia-military-strategy-bombing-cities.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/8/kramatorsk-train-station-attack-dozens-killed-ukraine-says,https://jewishjournal.com/news/worldwide/345515/statement-on-the-war-in-ukraine-by-scholars-of-genocide-nazism-and-world-war-ii/;Russian Pols to Make ‘Genocide’ Myth an Actual Law;;;;;;

That set the stage for opposition members of Pakistan’s 342-member National Assembly (lower house of parliament) to hold a no-confidence vote on March 8.Khan was expected to lose that vote.Pakistani lawmakers of the united opposition walk towards the parliament house building to cast their vote on a motion of no-confidence to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan, in Islamabad, on April 3, 2022. (Akhtar Soomro/Reuters)On April 7, Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled Khan’s move to block his removal was unconstitutional and said the National Assembly must be restored.The vote of no confidence against Khan is expected to go forward on April 9.Khan and other political allies had earlier claimed that the effort to oust him was “blatant interference in domestic politics by the United States.”And Russia has backed that narrative, with Khan and others claiming the bid to oust him stems from Pakistan’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“The further development of the situation leaves no doubt that the United States decided to punish the ‘disobedient’ Imran Khan,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on April 4, citing the PTI members’ “sudden” decision to join the opposition.""This is another attempt at shameless interference by the U.S. in the internal affairs of an independent state for its own selfish purposes. The above facts eloquently testify to this. The Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan himself has repeatedly stated that the conspiracy against him is inspired and financed from abroad.”In fact, Khan hasn’t orovided any serious evidence that the U.S. is out to get him, and the U.S. State Department says it’s untrue.Khan had earlier claimed that the Western-backed “foreign conspiracy” was sparked by his decision to visit Russia as Moscow launched its war of aggression against Ukraine on February 24. Pakistan also was one of 38 countries to abstain from a United Nations vote condemning Russia’s invasion of its neighbor.Khan claimed to have an “official document” proving the conspiracy to topple him.Khan pulled a paper out of his pocket at a large public rally on March 27. He had earlier described the document as “the formal communication of a senior official of a foreign country to Pakistan’s ambassador in the said country in a formal meeting,” Reuters reported. According to the news agency, Khan referenced the United States before correcting himself and saying “a foreign country.”“I am telling my nation today that this is our status. We are a nation of 220 million and another country — and they are not giving any reason — [is issuing threats]. They said that Imran Khan decided to go to Russia on his own even though the Foreign Office and the military leadership was consulted,” India’s The Tribune newspaper quoted him as saying.“Our ambassador told them that the decision [to visit Russia was made after consultations] but they are denying it and saying that ‘it was only because of Imran Khan and that our ties cannot be good if he stays.’ What they are actually saying is that they have no issue with the people who will replace Imran Khan.”Khan claimed the communique stated that Pakistan would be “forgiven” if the no-confidence vote against him passed and threatened “consequences” if it didn’t.A reporter from the Voice of America’s Urdu service asked U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price about the purported letter on March 31.Price said the United States supports “Pakistan’s constitutional process and the rule of law,” adding “there is no truth” to Khan’s allegations.Unconfirmed news reports in India and Pakistan, citing official and diplomatic sources, said the letter was actually a diplomatic cable about a meeting between Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States and U.S. officials. That cable was reportedly sent on March 7 — one day prior to the no-confidence motion being submitted.Writing for the Council on Foreign Relations, Pakistani author and journalist Zahid Hussain said “there is little evidence” to back claims that foreign powers orchestrated the no-confidence motion.“More likely, the government purposely exaggerated an informal conversation between a former Pakistani ambassador in Washington and an American diplomat to build a narrative that paints the opposition’s democratic move as a foreign conspiracy,” he wrote.Denials by State Department or anonymous officials do not disprove a conspiracy. Still, Khan has not provided any other evidence to support his allegations.Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan (3L) and President Arif Alvi (3R) watch fighter jets perform during the Pakistan Day parade in Islamabad on March 23, 2022. (Ghulam Rasool / AFP)On March 30, members of Khan’s government said they would present the alleged incriminating document to the Chief Justice of Pakistan.“If someone has doubts, the prime minister says if necessary, and for the people’s satisfaction, he is ready to present the letter to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, as he enjoys a good reputation,” Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar said.Shehbaz Sharif, the opposition leader and president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) political party, who was alleged to be part of the conspiracy, called on the government to do just that.Sharif asked the head of Pakistan’s army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) to present any evidence that opposition parties committed treason and sought foreign help to topple the government, Pakistan’s The News International reported.If it exists, the evidence should be presented to the country and the Supreme Court, he said. ""We will make this demand through our lawyers and request it to review the matter and create a forum which clarifies it,” Sharif said.Khan’s political misfortunes have been tied to Pakistan’s sky-high inflation — the worst in South Asia — and strained relations with the military, which has long played an outsized role in the country’s political life.Since Pakistan gained independence in 1947, no Pakistani prime minister has completed a full five-year term. The military has staged a number of successful coups, and the country has spent decades under military rule.Food and fuel shortages and rampant inflation have also plunged another South Asian country, Sri Lanka, into crisis, prompting social unrest.As in Pakistan, some Sri Lankan netizens, without evidence, are claiming the United States is orchestrating regime change in Sri Lanka because it abstained from the U.N. vote to condemn Russia’s invasion.";https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-prime-minister-survives-removal-effort-/6513044.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/7/pakistan-court-rules-blocking-vote-to-oust-khan-unconstitutional,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backing-regime-change-in-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-101648938530270.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-prime-minister-meets-putin-as-russia-attacks-ukraine-/6457960.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-parliament-begin-debate-no-confidence-pm-khan-2022-03-31/,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/threat-letter-from-us-pm-imran-khan-says-in-slip-of-tongue-382455,https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-march-31-2022/,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/pakistan-army-disputes-pm-imran-khan-says-no-evidence-suggesting-us-involvement-in-regime-change-report/articleshow/90659657.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,https://www.dawn.com/news/1682627,https://www.cfr.org/blog/imran-khans-undemocratic-action-deepens-pakistans-political-crisis,https://www.dawn.com/news/1682480/pm-can-only-show-threat-letter-to-cjp-minister,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/947775-if-opposition-committed-treason-shehabaz-asks-military-leadership-to-provide-evidence,https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/25/pakistan-inflation-imran-khan-no-confidence-vote/,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-has-no-pakistani-pm-ever-completed-a-full-term-hot-mic-with-nidhi-razdan-2864330,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coups_in_Pakistan,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/why-are-people-protesting-in-sri-lanka;Russia Backs Unfounded Coup Claim by Pakistan’s Khan;;;;;;
90;;;;False;Wang Wenbin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-ukraine-war-disinformation/6743328.html;China Spreads Kremlin War Lies, Bristles When Called Out;2022-03-25;polygraph;;"On March 23, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed concern that China could provide “material support” to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Stoltenberg noted China had already “provided Russia with political support, including by spreading blatant lies and misinformation.”On March 24, the one-month anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a journalist with Agence France-Presse asked Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin about Stoltenberg’s comments.Wang said “accusing China of spreading misinformation related to Ukraine is in itself disinformation.”That is false.Wang went on to take veiled jabs at the United States and NATO, warning against adding “fuel to the fire” or using “pressure” and “coercion.”Chinese officials have used similar language to criticize the United States for helping to arm Ukraine and sanctioning Russia for its invasion, but they have not criticized Russia for unilaterally launching a war of aggression.“What is needed to achieve lasting peace and stability is efforts to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all parties, not moves to seek bloc confrontation and absolute security,” Wang said.“China’s position is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China’s position is on the right side of history, and all groundless accusations and suspicions against China are indefensible and will simply collapse.”In fact, China has clearly spread Russian disinformation about the war. In the run-up to the war, Chinese state media accidentally released Communist Party directives telling journalists how to cover the war. They were told not to post content that was pro-Western or portrayed Russia in a negative light.The Associated Press reported that a letter criticizing Russia for its invasion, and signed by five professors from leading Chinese universities, was deleted from social media.Two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese state media repeated the long-debunked Kremlin talking point that “America made the promise to Russia against the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.” That is false.Once the war began, China’s Xinhua news agency uncritically reported on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s authorization of a so-called “special military operation.” Russian regulators have required news media to use that euphemism instead of “war” or “invasion.”Xinhua cited Putin as saying Russia would ""respond immediately” to “external interference in the situation in Ukraine,” without noting that Russia’s invasion is a blatant act of aggression and external interference.China has been in lockstep with Russia in refusing to call the unilateral invasion of Ukraine a war, using instead the terms “situation,” “crisis” or “conflict” or Putin’s own words, “special military operation.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying sidestepped the issue when asked whether she would call Russia’s invasion of Ukraine an invasion.“Regarding the definition of an invasion, I think we should go back to how to view the current situation in Ukraine,” Hua said. “The Ukrainian issue has [a] very complicated historical background that has continued to today.”A CNN report analyzing Chinese media and social media posts concluded that Beijing had largely adopted Russia’s talking points.Chinese media have reported on Russia’s war victories but not its defeats, and on aid delivered by Russia’s military, while avoiding discussion of Russia’s indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas.The CNN report noted that a false report about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fleeing Kyiv, first shared by Russian media and almost immediately picked up by Chinese media, received 510 million views on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.As Polygraph.info previously reported, Chinese state media have even attacked the United States for not protecting Ukraine against an invasion, even though they will not call it an invasion.Referring to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, CGTN’s First Voice falsely accused the United States of ignoring its commitments to provide security for Ukraine in exchange for it handing over its nuclear arsenal.Under the agreement, the United States and Russia, among other countries, gave Ukraine security assurances, which do not trigger legally binding responses to specific scenarios, such as an invasion.That “First Voice” article does not mention Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or Russia’s repeated violations of its commitments to Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity.These violations include Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, escalation of its eight-year proxy war in eastern Ukraine by backing pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, and now its launch of a full-scale invasion while placing its nuclear forces “on high alert.”When Putin called the United States an “empire of lies” in response to Western sanctions imposed for Russia’s invasion, Chinese state media adopted the phrase.When Russia began spreading the false claim that the United States is working with Ukrainian labs to develop biological weapons – including those that “can selectively affect various ethnic groups of the population” – China followed suit.Another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, falsely said the United States was engaged in “biological military activities” in Ukraine and elsewhere under the pretext of reducing “biological safety risks and strengthening global public health.”As Polygraph.info previously noted, none of the biolabs in Ukraine are run or controlled by the U.S. The legitimate research laboratories in Ukraine are not secret, and do not conduct “biological military activities.”China’s distortions of the war in Ukraine have affected the Chinese public’s perception of what is happening there.The New York Times noted that one Weibo user wrote: “If I only browsed Weibo … I would have believed that it was the United States that had invaded Ukraine.”Still, according to The Associated Press, public opinion is harder to measure in a country where the internet is heavily censored and state media dominates.Online surveys suggest Chinese may hold more nuanced positions.Polls on several Chinese websites found that some 40 percent of Chinese people are neutral about the war, 30 percent support Russia and 20 percent support Ukraine, according to The Diplomat, a Washington, D.C. news magazine.Meantime, while Wang claimed China’s position on Ukraine is in line “with the wishes of most countries,” 142 countries adopted a resolution demanding that Russia immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and withdraw its military.Only five countries, including Russia, voted against the resolution. China abstained.The United Nations International Court of Justice (ICJ) also rejected Russia’s assertion that it is halting genocide in its war to “de-nazify” Ukraine. In that 13-2 ruling, only Russia and China voted no. The ruling says Moscow must “immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced [in Ukraine].”";https://news.yahoo.com/nato-warns-china-not-help-134649186.html,https://www.euractiv.com/section/china/news/chinese-official-calls-sanctions-on-russia-increasingly-outrageous/,https://www.yahoo.com/video/chinese-media-accidentally-posts-ccp-151743081.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-china-seeks-to-unify-public-support-1a0fbda7db0554ca40569470fa48db6c,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-blames-us-ukraine/31721326.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-china-denial-invasion/31723481.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-budapest-memorandum-ukraine-russia-war/31741734.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-calls-west-an-empire-lies-after-sanctions-imposed-2022-02-28/,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/20220310/0b5e47674f394fd09eb479a4300606f8/c.html,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/202203/t20220309_10649938.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-kremlin-biolab-false-claims/31752688.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/business/china-russia-ukraine-invasion.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-china-seeks-to-unify-public-support-1a0fbda7db0554ca40569470fa48db6c,https://thediplomat.com/2022/03/why-do-many-chinese-sympathize-with-russia-in-the-ukraine-conflict/,https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/182/182-20220316-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf;China Spreads Kremlin War Lies, Bristles When Called Out;;;;;;

It’s aim is to destroy Russia.” In fact, that is false. For decades after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the end of the Cold War, the West has not only done much to help Russia, but also turned a blind eye to numerous Russian acts of aggression before the new Ukraine war. Here is just a small sample of the things the United States has done to help and court Russia, from a U.S. State Department archive covering the years 1991 to 2009.- In January 1992, the U.S. authorized $645 million in humanitarian aid to the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union.- That same month, Boris Yeltsin made his first visit to the United States as Russian president, during which he and then-U.S. president George H.W. Bush negotiated mutual arms reduction. Bush agreed to support Russia’s case for assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They issued a joint declaration stating that the United States and the Russian Federation were not enemies.- In February 1992, the U.S. military’s Operation Provide Hope delivered medicine and medical equipment to all of the former Soviet republics, including Russia.At the same time, the West did little while Yeltsin was in power and Russia bullied Georgia and Moldova. Russian forces played a key role in helping pro-Kremlin separatist movements defeat the legitimate governments in those countries. These “frozen conflicts,” as they came to be known, continue to this day. In 2008, a Russian-backed upsurge in separatist violence in Georgia was followed by direct Russian military intervention in that country.In 1994-1996, Russia launched a brutal but unsuccessful war against separatist forces in Chechnya, which had declared de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The U.S., like most nations, did not recognize this breakaway territory.Had the West truly wanted to destroy Russia, there was no better time to do so than the 1990s, when the country was wracked by economic instability, poverty and organized crime. Instead, the West continued to bail out Russia’s leaders despite rampant corruption and violence, and threats of violence toward Russia’s neighbors.U.S. cooperation with and assistance to Russia did not end after Yeltsin handed the reins of power to Putin. In 2000, then-U.S. President Bill Clinton went to Moscow and signed a number of agreements with the new Russian president. Among them was the first permanent joint Russian-U.S. military mission, which entailed monitoring space and missile launches globally. Clinton and his successor, George W. Bush, continued to meet with Putin and hammer out agreements on arms reduction, arms control and counter-terrorism.Even after Russia’s five-day war against Georgia in 2008, the U.S. and European Union continued to do business with Russia. In early 2009, newly-inaugurated U.S. president Barack Obama announced a “reset” with Russia in hopes of improving bilateral relations, which had deteriorated. That was followed by large investments in Russia by U.S. corporations, including PepsiCo, which poured in $1 billion that year.Meanwhile, Ukraine and Georgia, both of which were seeking NATO membership, were denied action plans to join the alliance. The push to deny NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia was mainly led by France and Germany, and was largely due to concerns about provoking Russia. Russia, in cooperation with several Western European countries, finished the Nord Stream I natural gas pipeline in 2012 to sell more of its gas to Europe. Construction on a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2, began in 2011, and was nearly ready to operate before Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago. Workers are seen at the construction site of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, near the town of Kingisepp, Leningrad region, Russia, June 5, 2019. (Anton Vaganov/Reuters)The list of investments in Russia, and joint projects between Western countries and Russia, could go on for pages. So how did Russia repay the West for decades of patience and tolerance for malfeasance? - In 2007, Russia launched a wave of cyberattacks on Estonia. - As previously noted, Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. It later officially recognized the two breakaway regions in Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.- In 2014, Russia occupied and annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and fomented a war in its eastern Donbas region. This was the first aggressive Russian action that met with a Western response, mainly in the form of economic sanctions.- In 2016, Russia engaged in a campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, which included the dissemination of disinformation via social media and cyberattacks.- Also in 2016, Russia was accused of plotting a coup to overthrow the pro-Western government of Montenegro. - In 2018, Russian agents attempted to assassinate Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, using a Russian military grade chemical nerve agent. One person was killed and three hospitalized as a result of this operation. (In 2006, Russian agents had poisoned the dissident former Russian intelligence operative Alexander Litvinenko with a radioactive substance in London. One of the men involved in that assassination went on to become a member of Russia’s parliament.)- Multiple assassinations and attempted assassinations against Chechen dissidents in Europe and the Middle East have been linked to Russia. This is only a partial list of provocations leading up to Russia’s latest escalation. In just a few weeks, Putin’s full-scale invasion has left thousands dead, millions displaced and multiple Ukrainian cities looking like they were once again in the Second World War.;https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/85962.htm,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/provide_hope.htm,https://theconversation.com/the-wild-decade-how-the-1990s-laid-the-foundations-for-vladimir-putins-russia-141098,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/world/rescuing-russia-special-report-bailout-kremlin-us-pressed-imf.html,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-us-pepsi-russia-070609-2009jul06-story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/09/04/that-time-ukraine-tried-to-join-nato-and-nato-said-no/,https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415;Putin Says the West Wants to ‘Destroy Russia,’ But That Ignores History;;;;;;
92;;;;False;William Jones;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-uyghur-genocide-larouche-movement/6743326.html;To Defend Mistreating Uyghurs, China Turns to Fringe U.S. Source;2022-03-23;polygraph;;"On March 21, the U.S. State Department imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials allegedly responsible for rights abuses, including the repression of “ethnic minority groups.”In January 2021, the United States became the first country to officially describe China’s treatment of one such group – the Uyghur Muslim minority in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region – as genocide.More than 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have allegedly been subjected to mass internment, forced sterilization and labor, torture, religious repression and other forms of cultural erasure.On March 21, Deng Xijun, China’s ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian nations, shared a video clip from New China TV, the official YouTube Channel of China’s Xinhua News Agency. The clip includes excerpts of an interview with William Jones, Washington bureau chief for the news magazine Executive Intelligence Review, in which he disputes any genocide in Xinjiang.“The allegation of so-called genocide in China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is fabricated by some western media outlets and a total farce,” the New China TV video summarizes Jones as saying.Jones repeats various bogus Beijing talking points, including:People in Xinjiang are still speaking and being educated in their own language(s).People in Xinjiang are still practicing their own religion.More mosques are being built in Xinjiang than anywhere else in the world.The population of Xinjiang is growing.Polygraph.info and other fact checkers have previously debunked many of these claims.Executive Intelligence Review was founded in 1974 by Lyndon LaRouche, a fringe U.S. political activist and failed presidential candidate often described as ‘cultlike,’ who died in 2019.“‘Journalists’ associated with the LaRouche’s news outlet, the Executive Intelligence Review, are regularly invited to Chinese government press conferences in Washington and are quoted extensively in Chinese state media, where they often parrot government propaganda,” The Intelligencer, an offshoot of New York magazine, wrote in its February 2019 obituary of LaRouche.“[T]here’s the dangerous possibility that Chinese officials and academics actually think the LaRouche movement is a serious Western group.”Jones is also a nonresident fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, a Chinese think tank.Many of Jones’ claims regarding Xinjiang are misleading, if not false. For example, while Uyghurs still communicate in their own language, China has tried to reduce its place in society.In June 2017, authorities in Xinjiang’s Hotan prefecture, which is largely populated by Uyghurs, banned the use of the Uyghur language at schools in favor of Mandarin Chinese, “in order to strengthen elementary and middle/high school bilingual education,” Radio Free Asia, a VOA sister news outlet, reported.Thousands of Uyghur children have been placed in Mandarin-only orphanages and boarding schools, where children described being “hit with rulers” if they spoke Uyghur.In December 2021, the U.K.’s Guardian newspaper reported that no Uyghur-language books had been published in China since 2017.Textbooks that taught classic poems and folk tales were banned, in what some experts said was a systematic effort to keep young Uyghurs from learning their language and culture.“It’s a slow process of cultural re-engineering to reshape Uyghur culture from top to bottom – to eradicate most fundamentally the Uyghur language, or to erode it to the extent that among younger generations, it might potentially die out,” James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic studies at LaTrobe University in Melbourne, Australia, told The Associated Press.An ethnic Uyghur woman walks in front of a giant screen with a picture of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the main city square in Kashgar on September 6, 2018. (Thomas Peter/Reuters)The year 2017 marked a turning point both in the crackdown on language education and repression in Xinjiang, with reports of mass internment camps, religious and cultural repression and other systematic rights abuses. And while Jones claims Xinjiang’s Uyghur population has been growing, 2017 saw a decline. Chinese authorities claim Xinjiang’s population grew 18.5 percent between 2010 and 2020. But Rian Thum, a historian of Islam in China and the Uyghurs at the U.K.’s University of Manchester, says that time frame does not count what happened from 2017 onward, when “Uyghur births were brutally suppressed.”“It's telling that they won't tell us what the *current* population growth rate for Uyghurs is. How did 2020 compare to 2019? This would seem to b[e] crucial data for a state looking to convince the world that it is not preventing births in an indigenous group,” he tweeted.In 2015, the year the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government began linking population growth to “religious extremism,” natural population growth decreased across all Chinese minority regions, according to Adrian Zenz, a scholar on the People’s Republic of China who has reported extensively on Xinjiang.In his research paper, “Sterilizations, IUDs, and Mandatory Birth Control: The CCP’s Campaign to Suppress Uighur Birthrates in Xinjiang,” Zenz wrote that in 2010, nine of the top 10 Chinese counties with the highest natural population growth rates — as much as five times the national average — had large Uyghur or Kyrgyz populations.“Natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically; growth rates fell by 84 percent in the two largest Uyghur prefectures between 2015 and 2018, and declined further in several minority regions in 2019,” Zenz wrote.Zenz linked that population growth decline to a Chinese government campaign to cut Uyghur and other ethnic minority birth rates through measures that included pregnancy checks, forced intrauterine devices, sterilization, abortions and extrajudicial internment for birth control violations.According to Zenz, this proves that Beijing is carrying out a campaign of genocide under the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which states that genocide includes “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.”“The case for demographic genocide and the atrocity is of course based on dramatic [population] declines starting in 2017, draconian sterilization targets for 2019, plus punishing birth control violations with internment, a policy that started in 2018,” Zenz told Polygraph.info in November 2020. “Also, a near-zero birth rate target for Kizilsu prefecture for 2020.”Chinese state media accuse Zenz, whose research is widely cited in Western media reports, of being “a right-wing Christian” seeking to slander the CCP.But publicly available information supports his claims.According to the China Statistical Yearbook 2020, compiled by China’s National Bureau of Statistics, Xinjiang’s natural population growth rate fell from 11.4 per 1,000 in 2017 to 3.7 per 1,000 in 2019. That 68 percent decline far exceeded the national average.Likewise, while China claims Xinjiang has more mosques per capita than many Muslim countries, there is much evidence China’s government has destroyed thousands of mosques and other religious sites in the region.Beijing’s broader efforts to curtail Uyghur religious and social life have also been documented.These include the destruction of traditional Uyghur architectural and design elements and the replacement of home furnishings with more “sinicized” household items.Uyghurs have reportedly been compelled to eat pork and drink alcohol, which are forbidden by Islam. In October 2020, Chinese authorities reportedly banned Muslim believers from making private pilgrimages to Mecca, one of the five pillars of Islam.Although Chinese state media have publicized scenes of public dancing to mark Eid al-Fitr – the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan – others observers claim such events were staged. Celebratory house visits to mark the occasion were reportedly banned.State-directed, public displays of dancing, versus organic celebrations, fit into what one expert called “exoticized song-and-dance spectacles that cater to the growing national tourism industry.”On March 8, Amnesty International and almost 200 other rights organizations sent an open letter to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urging her to release a “long-awaited report on the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region without further delay.”Polygraph.info reached out to Jones for comment.

93;;;;Likely False;Russian Defense Ministry;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-no-verifiable-evidence-of-false-flag-attack-on-mariupol-theater/6743324.html;No Verifiable Evidence of False Flag Attack on Mariupol Theater;2022-03-23;polygraph;;"On March 16, an airstrike hit a theater sheltering hundreds of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which remains under siege by Russian forces. The hit was initially reported by Mariupol’s city council on Telegram.The Donetsk Regional Theater of Drama has a distinctive red roof, was not close to other buildings, and the words “children” were painted – in huge white letters on the pavement on two sides of the building – for pilots to see.Exact casualties are unknown. Rescuers worked to pull out survivors, finding 130 by March 17. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, up to 1,300 people had been sheltered in the building, and many may still be trapped under rubble.Russia’s military and state media quickly began spinning the attack by weaving it into the false Kremlin narrative that the war on Ukraine is about fighting fascism and Nazis.A story published by Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency quoted the Russian Defense Ministry stating that Ukrainian forces were responsible:""According to the available reliable data, the militants of the Azov nationalist battalion committed a new bloody provocation by blowing up the theater building they had mined,"" the ministry was quoted as saying.That is unsubstantiated and likely false. The ministry provided no evidence, and the statement was contradicted by other Russian claims, including an assertion that Azov forces were sheltering in the building. In both Ukraine and Syria, the Kremlin also has a history of false claims that opponents conducted “false-flag” attacks on themselves or their own civilians to blame Russia.On March 17, the Russian Embassy in the U.K. posted a video in which a purported “refugee” from Mariupol spoke on camera about the theater attack.“Refugee from #Mariupol says militants from Azov nationalist battalion, while retreating, blew up the city drama theatre, where there were civilians, whom they used as human shield,” the tweet read. “Militants also deployed military equipment near bomb shelters and residential buildings.” The woman is not identified, and Polygraph.info was unable to confidently trace her whereabouts using visual search or geolocation tools. Russia has a history of using ""actors"" in Ukraine to sell stories about alleged atrocities. For example, after Ukrainian government forces retook the city of Slovyansk in 2014, the Russian state TV Channel One aired an interview with a ""refugee"" from the town, who claimed to have witnessed Ukrainian forces killing a woman and crucifying her young son. The story was quickly revealed to be false. Another famous ""actress"" was Maria Tsipko, who appeared in several different ""roles"" in Kremlin media interviews about Ukraine. Given this well-established practice and the lack of any ID for the alleged ""eyewitness"" of the false flag attack in Mariupol, it would be reasonable to be skeptical. The only evidence that any personnel from the Azov regiment were present at the theater comes from video that the regiment itself posted online on March 10. It shows a local escorting a regiment member around the theater’s premises, explaining that civilians were inside and discussing their needs. The video shows no evidence that a large number of fighters or any military equipment were at the theater. It is not clear how the Azov fighters would have managed to set up explosives in the building where over 1,000 people were sheltering without being noticed or without anyone trying to escape. Among other false or misleading justifications, Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the war as an effort to “de-nazify” Ukraine. That has allowed Kremlin propaganda to exploit the history of Ukraine’s Azov militia and other fringe right-wing groups even though they are a minuscule part of Ukraine’s democratic system.Known formally as the Azov Special Operations Detachment, the group began as a paramilitary unit called the Azov Battalion in 2014 , when Ukraine had to hastily gather an army to defend against Russian-led fighting in its eastern Donbas region.Although it was just one among dozens of volunteer militias, Azov garnered controversy over the far-right politics of its initial founders, the use of neo-Nazi symbolism in some of its insignia, and the anti-Semitic views of some members.After the unit was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2015, its original commander, Andrii Biletsky, and many other early members left to start a far-right political party known as National Corps. Yet even when competing in a bloc with other nationalist parties in a 2019 parliamentary election, these far-right activists as a whole were unable to attract enough support to win a single seat in Ukraine’s parliament.Since its integration, Azov regiment members have repeatedly denied being a far-right political unit, although they acknowledge that it includes individuals with such views.While Russia provided no credible evidence that Azov was behind the theater attack, multiple news accounts reported on the strike, quoting Ukrainian officials who attributed the destruction to a Russian bombing.According to the BBC:“Dmytro Gurin, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and originally from Mariupol, said the shelter in the basement of the building withstood the attack, and that teams were trying to clear the rubble which covered the entrance to the site. ‘It looks like most of them have survived and are OK,’ he said. “But the rescue efforts were tricky, he said, as Russia had continued to attack the area. ‘Shelling never stops and artillery never stops and airplanes are dropping bombs,’ he said, ‘so it's really difficult'."" According to the Daily Beast: “The building, which is located in the heart of the city, is now 'now fully ruined', according to Ukrainian Minister of Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, who added in a statement about the attack that the Russians 'could not have not known this was a civilian shelter'.“The Mariupol city council accused Russian forces of 'purposefully and cynically' destroying the theater, adding that a ‘plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding’.” The Telegraph posted this interview with a witness to YouTube:";https://t.me/mariupolrada/8880,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/europe/ukraine-mariupol-bombing-theater-russia-intl/index.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-and-syria-more-falsehoods-about-false-flag-attacks/31112143.html,https://twitter.com/RussianEmbassy/status/1504509910758957057,https://www.thedailybeast.com/theres-no-evidence-the-ukrainian-army-crucified-a-child-in-slovyansk,https://www.stopfake.org/en/russian-disinfo-patterns-same-actors-different-sets/,https://www.stopfake.org/ru/rossmi-bezosnovatelno-obvinili-azov-v-podryve-teatra-v-mariupole/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/azov-far-right-fighters-ukraine-neo-nazis,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/380483-congress-bans-arms-to-controversial-ukrainian-militia-linked-to-neo-nazis,https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-the-far-right-just-got-humiliated-in-ukraine-s-election-but-don-t-write-it-off-1.7563138,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60776929,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-destroys-mariupol-drama-theater-where-a-1000-civilians-were-sheltering-ukraine-officials-say;No Verifiable Evidence of False Flag Attack on Mariupol Theater;;;;;;

In a backpack near the remains of one of the militants, a Tennessee flag of the United States was found, as well as other items that made it possible to identify the deceased as Captain Michael Hawker, Lieutenant Logan Shrum and Lieutenant Cruz Toblin.” Trouble is, the Tennessee National Guard called the report out as bunk. In a statement, the Guard’s Office of Adjutant General said the three men were “accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, U.S. mercenaries killed in Donetsk People’s Republic.”The Guard said it suspects the three were chosen because their images were in an official publication of the outfit’s 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which had been deployed to Ukraine in 2018 as part of a joint, multinational training group. According to the Guard’s statement, the three were among 200 soldiers on the 2018 mission to further develop the Yavoriv Combat Training Center in Ukraine. Once the mission concluded, all members “returned safely to their home state,” the statement said.In fact, the training took place far from Marinka, where Russian media claimed the soldiers died. The center in Yavoriv is 15 kilometers from the Polish border in western Ukraine, a country the size of Texas. In a strike that U.S. officials said was dangerously close to a NATO country, Russians hit the base on Sunday, killing 35 and injuring 130, Ukrainian officials said. The self-declared, Russia-backed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region have been in conflict with the central government in Kyiv since 2014, when Russia instigated an insurgency after a popular uprising that ousted Ukraine's pro-Kremlin president.;https://english.pravda.ru/news/world/150742-us_mercenaries_donetsk/,http://inwestukraine.org.ua/geography-of-projects/yavoriv/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/air-strike-launched-ukraine-military-base-near-polish-border-lviv-authorities-2022-03-13/,https://www.mk.ru/politics/2022/03/17/v-dnr-zayavili-o-likvidacii-trekh-amerikanskikh-naemnikov.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://russian.rt.com/ussr/news/977462-dnr-nayomniki-likvidaciya?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop;Tennessee Guard Calls Out Kremlin on Fake Mercenary Deaths;;;;;;

The conversation quickly turned to the invasion of Ukraine, or as the Kremlin euphemistically insists on calling it, the “special military operation.” During a Q&A that appeared to be stage-managed, Putin essentially summarized his argument for attacking Ukraine. His remarks, which went unchallenged, included multiple falsehoods and misleading statements. Despite past Russian promises to respect Ukraine’s borders, Putin falsely argues that Ukraine is not even a real country. And he’s spuriously claimed that Ukraine’s government is fascist and full of Nazis even as his forces bombard civilians and hospitals under fierce resistance from Ukrainian military forces – and civilians who protested in the streets. Distorting the Origins – The Maidan “Coup” Putin retold his distorted history of the conflict with Ukraine. About Ukraine’s Maidan uprising in February 2014, he said: “The fact is that after the state unconstitutional coup in Ukraine, which was actively supported, unfortunately, by Western countries … they said directly that they spent five billion dollars on it, they distributed hot pies on the Maidan and so on.”But that is a false and simplistic characterization. Ukraine’s Maidan uprising was a popular revolt, not a coup. Ukraine’s pro-Russian president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych, had rejected a European-brokered agreement to revise Ukraine’s constitution. Protests had turned violent, with scores of deaths. Yanukovych ultimately resigned and fled Kyiv, then was voted out by a majority in Ukraine’s parliament who claimed he’d abandoned his office. Whether that was legally sufficient to remove Yanukovych has been a matter of dispute, but describing the events as a “coup” is a misrepresentation. Polygraph.info has previously addressed false Russian claims about Maidan. The Revolution of Dignity. Kyiv, Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti), December 8, 2013.The claim that Western countries spent $5 billion to support the “coup” simply repeats a false story line pushed by Russian state media and other pro-Kremlin sources. In fact, the $5 billion refers to the entirety of U.S. aid to Ukraine at that point since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, including economic development and relief programs. It includes one particularly pricey item – assisting Ukraine’s nuclear disarmament after it signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. Under that pact, Russia, the U.K. and the United States gave Ukraine security assurances and pledged to respect its borders if it gave up its Soviet-era nuclear stockpile. The Phony Crimean ‘Referendum’ Next, Putin alluded to the fantasy tale that people in Crimea had rejected the Maidan “coup” and held a referendum to reunite with Russia. He said:“Crimea, as you know, made a decision – people came to a referendum and voted – to return to the Russian Federation. Naturally, we could not but support this, especially since they were in danger from nationalists and neo-fascists. I will now say that there are full confirmations that they were right then.” No one in Crimea was threatened by “nationalists or neo-fascists.” In fact, they were threatened by Russian soldiers wearing uniforms without insignia, who entered Crimea in March 2014, took over the parliament building, raised Russian flags and installed a pro-Kremlin leader.The Russian occupiers organized and oversaw a so-called “referendum” in Crimea. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections in various countries, was prevented from working in Crimea while the vote took place. Data leaked from the Kremlin’s Human Rights Council revealed that overall voter turnout may have been as low as one-third of the Crimean population, with barely more than half voting in favor of the peninsula’s annexation by Russia. On March 27, 2014, 100 United Nations member states supported a resolution affirming the “territorial integrity” of Ukraine and questioning the Crimean referendum’s validity. On December 7, 2020, a U.N. resolution calling on Russia to withdraw from Crimea passed with 63 votes. (The resolutions were non-binding and opposed by the Kremlin.) Unsupported Nuclear Claims Putin went on to make unsubstantiated claims about Ukraine seeking nuclear weapons. He said:“Now they are talking about acquiring nuclear status, that is, acquiring nuclear weapons. We cannot ignore such things, especially since we know how the so-called West behaves towards Russia.” Putin made a similar allegation during an address on February 21, several days before ordering the all-out invasion of Ukraine. In fact, Ukraine began the process of nuclear disarmament in 1994. The United States has monitored the process, and neither U.S. officials nor the International Atomic Energy Agency have reported attempts by Ukraine to divert resources from peaceful atomic energy for use in nuclear weapons.Some Ukrainian politicians have said that, given Russia’s apparent violations of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, and given NATO’s stated unwillingness to invite Ukraine into the alliance, Ukraine’s would be justified in revising its non-nuclear status. Still, Ukraine has not done this, and there is no evidence it has taken any steps toward acquiring or producing nuclear weapons.Bizarre Claims of Hostage Taking In his meeting with the Aeroflot employees, Putin made a new claim – that Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv and Sumy, both under heavy assault by Russian forces in the invasion, have been “taking foreign hostages.”“What is happening now is also very important. Look, foreign citizens were taken hostage in Sumy, in Kharkov – more than 6,000 young people, students. They were driven to the railway station and are being held for the third day.” Putin apparently was referring to problems with evacuating thousands of foreign students, mostly from India. Of course, if Putin was concerned about their welfare, he could have ordered his military to let them safely leave.This picture shows an apartment building damaged after shelling the day before in Ukraine's second-biggest city of Kharkiv on March 8, 2022.There no evidence that Ukrainian authorities took foreigners as “hostages.” As the BBC reported, some 20,000 of Ukraine’s 76,000 foreign students are from India. Evacuation from Ukrainian cities to the safer, western side of the country has been just as problematic and difficult for ordinary Ukrainian citizens. This is doubly so in Kharkiv, which came under assault early in the invasion and remains a major front in the war. So far, at least 12,000 Indian students have been evacuated, according to the Indian Foreign Secretary. According to reporting by Al Jazeera, the Indian government has come under criticism for allegedly not having a plan or strategy for evacuating its citizens trapped in Ukraine. On March 1, an Indian medical student was killed by Russian shelling in Kharkiv.;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/09/world/ukraine-russia-war,https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-denies-reviving-russian-empire-says-ukraine-not-real-country-2022-2,https://www.npr.org/2022/03/01/1083677765/putin-denazify-ukraine-russia-history,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin-ukraine-attack-antisemitism-denazify,https://www.rferl.org/a/was-yanukovychs-ouster-constitutional/25274346.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-distorts-history-of-maidan-revolution-in-ukraine/29617691.html,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/mar/19/facebook-posts/united-states-spent-5-billion-ukraine-anti-governm/,https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Ukraine-Nuclear-Weapons,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-budapest-memorandum-ukraine-russia-war/31741734.html,https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-crisis-in-Crimea-and-eastern-Ukraine ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-crimea-was-not-threatened-with-extermination-by-nationalists/31683608.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-annexation-crimea/31129974.html,https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm,https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/ga12295.doc.htm,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-more-putin-disinfo-bizarre-claim-about-ukrainian-nukes/31723522.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/ukraine-may-seek-nuclear-weapons-if-left-out-of-nato-diplomat,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-attack-kahrkiv-administration-building/31734420.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60551905,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/1/indian-student-killed-in-ukraine-amid-criticism-over-evacuation;Putin’s Fraudulent Foundation for Attacking Ukraine;;;;;;

These messages carry the NATO logo,” CCTV reported.""Civil militia"" refers to the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), a self-proclaimed state and Russia-backed rebel group which declared independence from Ukraine in May 2014. Denis Pushilin is the current head of the DNR.A militant of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) holds a weapon on the line of separation from the Ukrainian armed forces south of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk on April 2, 2021.During a press conference on March 6, Pushilin commented on the DNR’s alleged acquisition of the laptop from Right Sector, and the information it contains.“The militants of the [Ukrainian] nationalists battalions have a special level of security clearance from the North Atlantic Alliance [NATO]. This laptop contains a detailed map of the area with the location of our units.”He also alleged the Ukrainian military planned to attack Crimea and Donbas in the spring of 2022.“According to our intelligence and the testimony of prisoners, an offensive operation was supposed to begin on 8 March of this year,” Russia’s Sputnik news agency quoted Pushilin as saying.“The facts indicate that the invasion was planned simultaneously both on the territory of the republics of Donbas and in Russia's Crimea.”Neither the initial Russian reports or Chinese media have provided any corroborating evidence for this alleged plan to retake eastern Ukraine and Crimea.When political commentator Maria Dubovikova, who routinely spreads Russian disinformation, first shared the story on Twitter, she was widely ridiculed.Netizens took issue with details regarding the computer.The laptop was scrutinized for how old it is, with many online commentators questioning whether it even worked. Political analyst Arieh Kovler, for example, identified the laptop as a 14-year-old Lenovo R500, which came with the long-discontinued Windows Vista operating system.Others mocked the fact the laptop bears several stickers labeling it as a NATO computer, and had duct tape affixed to the bottom right side.One online commentator said: “Surprised it doesn't say, ‘Secret NATO Computer’.”Another wrote: “Hey, at least they went to the effort of making a ‘NATO’ asset tag sticker for it. A+ for effort, lads.”Others noted that a laptop of that age “would fail security audits,” and otherwise be “incompatible with security systems used at NATO.”Those criticisms aside, the laptop in fact was at one time NATO property.A NATO official confirmed to Polygraph.info that while a review is ongoing into how the laptop ended up in the hands of Russian-supported forces, “initial findings are that this computer was sold as surplus several years ago in line with standard procedures.”The NATO official said there “weren’t any classified files on the computer when it was sold.”Responding to the report on March 6, NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges, David van Weel, said on Twitter:""We don't work on 15 year old laptops at NATO. Then we would have just as bad information as you in this war of Russia against Ukraine and its innocent civilians.”Still, there is no evidence that Ukraine’s military was mobilizing to recapture Crimea and Donbas on March 8.Nor is there evidence NATO was collaborating with Right Sector, a far-right Ukrainian political party and paramilitary movement, or that NATO gave Right Sector’s members “a special level of security clearance.”Right Sector has long featured in Russian disinformation seeking to discredit Ukraine after the 2014 Maidan revolution, Russia’s seizure of Crimea and the Kremlin’s clandestine invasion of eastern Ukraine. Writing for Foreign Policy magazine, freelance journalist Hanna Kozlowska reported that Right Sector “was the second-most mentioned political group in Russian mass media in 2014.”Russia’s Izvestia newspaper, for example, apparently fabricated a story that Right Sector was “destroying” the local Jewish community in Odesa.Analysts say, however, that Russian media have drastically overstated Right Sector’s capability. “The Right Sector is a minuscule group of people who have no – and never had – meaningful resources to recapture either Donbas or Crimea,” Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert on the European radical right, told Polygraph.info.Supporters of Serhiy Sternenko, a Ukrainian civil rights activist and former leader of the far-right radical group Right Sector, hold a rally outside presidential administration headquarters in Odesa, February 27, 2021.Russian disinformation, which has long attempted to paint the 2014 Ukrainian Maidan revolt as a right-wing coup d’état, has falsely accused Ukraine’s security services of having created Right Sector. It has further alleged, without evidence, that the United States and NATO finance Right Sector.The group has never had broad public support. In Ukraine’s May 2014 presidential elections, the Right Sector candidate only received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections. Right Sector won just 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections.All of Ukraine’s far-right forces united for the 2019 parliamentary elections, but still only won 2.15% of the vote — not enough to gain a single seat.On its website, Right Sector says its military wing, the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps, “fights against the subversive forces of the enemy in the rear, setting itself the task of liberating all Ukrainian lands from Russian occupation.”Many Ukrainian militias that formed in response to Russia’s clandestine invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014 have since been integrated into Ukraine’s armed forces.For example, the far-right Azov Battalion has a regiment within Ukraine’s National Guard.Like other militant organizations, Shekhovtsov said, “there was a very small group” within Right Sector that refused to join Ukraine’s armed forces.In 2014, Right Sector former leader Dmitry Yarosh claimed the entire group (political and military wing) had 10,000 members. Outside, contemporary estimates on Right Sector’s membership or the size of its military segment are unavailable, however.

(Yefrem Lukatsky/AP)Under its terms, Ukraine agreed to turn over its nuclear warheads and join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. In exchange, Ukraine received security assurances from the signatories – Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.But unlike the NATO charter or NPT, the agreement is not a legally binding treaty that comes with an enforcement mechanism. It offers assurances, not guarantees, that is, not specific promises made in response to specific scenarios such as an invasion.In the memorandum, the signatories “reaffirmed” five points:· “[T]o respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine;”· “[T]o refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine…;”· “[T]o refrain from economic coercion” against Ukraine;· “[T]o seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine…if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used;”· “[N]ot to use nuclear weapons against” Ukraine.The United States did not violate or “ignore” any of the five commitments it reaffirmed in the memorandum. But Russia has.Russia repeatedly violated the commitments a) when it annexed Crimea in 2014; b) when it escalated a proxy war in eastern Ukraine by backing pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces; and c) with its full-scale invasion and placement of nuclear forces “on high alert.”However, while scolding the U.S. with a distortion of history, China has not condemned Russia for any of the Kremlin's obvious violations of the security assurances and inflicting civilian carnage across Ukraine.Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer, who participated in the Budapest Memorandum negotiations, wrote in an article for the Brookings Institution in 2019 that “when negotiating the security assurances, U.S. officials told their Ukrainian counterparts that, were Russia to violate them, the United States would take a strong interest and respond.”“Washington did not promise unlimited support,” Pifer added. “The Budapest Memorandum contains security ‘assurances,’ not ‘guarantees.’ Guarantees would have implied a commitment of American military force, which NATO members have. U.S. officials made clear that was not on offer.”The memorandum itself does not specify what any response should be.Why didn’t the U.S. and Ukrainian officials then discuss in detail how Washington might respond in the event of a Russian violation? According to Pifer, it “owed in part to then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin” who “insisted that there be no revision of the boundaries separating the states that emerged from the Soviet collapse.”“Yeltsin respected Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity. Vladimir Putin does not,” Pifer wrote.Officials did assure their Ukrainian counterparts that the United States would act if Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum, Pifer noted.“[T]here is an obligation on the United States that flows from the Budapest Memorandum to provide assistance to Ukraine, and … that would include lethal military assistance,” Pifer said at a seminar hosted by the Brookings in 2014.The United States has swiftly responded to the ongoing Russian invasion by rallying allies to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia and deliver weapons and economic aid to Ukraine. Biden spearheaded international condemnation of the Russian invasion and demanded that Moscow stop the war.According to the Pentagon, the United States has provided more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine in the past year and has has pledged more defense aid.U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Mara Karlin told the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee on March 1 that U.S. military support to Ukraine since last September has included Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-tank rocket systems, grenade launchers, and more than 2,000 tons of ammunition, including mortar and artillery rounds, small arms, and machine guns.The United States and NATO delivered more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin missiles, to Ukraine in less than a week, The New York Times reported on March 6.On March 2, the White House asked the U.S. Congress to authorize an additional $10 billion in security, humanitarian and economic assistance for Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on March 6 that Congress intends to enact that additional aid this week, according to Reuters.Ukrainian leaders have told U.S. officials that American and other allied weaponry is making a difference on the battlefield, the Times reported. Social media and other media have posted videos and photographs showing what appeared to be Ukrainian soldiers successfully attacking Russian armed convoys and helicopters using Javelins and Stingers.The United States and its allies have also coordinated the broadest sanctions against Russia ever.They include freezing assets controlled by President Putin, some of his top aides, Russian oligarchs, companies and government agencies; cutting off Russia’s biggest commercial banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, which, according to the White House, will disconnect them “from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally”; and banning Russia from importing defense and strategic technologies.The sanctions have devastated the Russian ruble and forced the Russian stock market to shut down.Both the White House and NATO have sought to avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia, fearing rapid escalation and risk of nuclear conflict.As the invading Russian forces bear down on Ukrainian cities with shelling and bombing hitting homes, businesses and civilians, calls for establishing a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace have grown louder both inside Ukraine, including from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and internationally.However, both the United States and NATO have ruled that measure out, as it could involve U.S. and NATO forces shooting down Russian aircraft inside the Ukrainian airspace, amounting to direct conflict.Following the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, China, although not a party, nonetheless extended security assurances to Ukraine were it targeted or threatened with a “nuclear” invasion.In a 2013 joint statement signed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, China pledged “to provide Ukraine security assurances when Ukraine encounters an invasion involving nuclear weapons or Ukraine is under threat of a nuclear invasion.”Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert on February 27. Asked by a reporter on March 3 about China’s “security assurances” to Ukraine, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that “the security assurances have clear limitations on the content and are triggered under specific conditions.” He offered no further explanation.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on March 7 that China is “willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation when needed."" He also said China would provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine “as soon as possible” and praised China’s friendship with Russia as “rock solid,” Reuters reported.Beijing has called on the West to respect Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.” The Chinese government has expressed “regret” over civilian casualties in Ukraine and repeatedly called on “all parties to exercise necessary restraint.”At the same time, Beijing has described Western-led sanctions on Russia as illegal, ineffective and unilateral and has refused to participate in them.“We will continue to maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with relevant parties,"" Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said at a March 2 news conference.";http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-03-02/Message-from-Biden-s-address-U-S-divided-at-home-unreliable-abroad-184nyfYyW9q/index.html,https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%203007/Part/volume-3007-I-52241.pdf,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm,https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text/,https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-calls-up-reservists/1862314.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-overwhelming-evidence-russia-behind-ukraine-unrest/1889965.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-russian-troops-continue-battle-for-control-of-kyiv/6461615.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-vetoes-un-security-action-ukraine-china-abstains-2022-02-25/,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3169010/un-votes-condemn-russian-invasion-ukraine-china-again-stays-silent,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/05/why-care-about-ukraine-and-the-budapest-memorandum/,https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/20141209_budapest_memorandum_transcript.pdf,https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2955960/us-provided-more-than-1-billion-in-security-assistance-to-ukraine-in-past-year/,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2022/03/04/the-u-s-wont-repeat-its-sending-stingers-to-ukraine-00014317,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-03-06/u-s-congress-to-explore-russian-oil-ban-enact-10-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine-this-week-house-speaker-pelosi,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0608,https://www.vox.com/22956536/what-sanctions-do-russia-economy-ukraine-oil,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russian-rouble-drops-fresh-record-low-thin-offshore-trade-2022-03-07/,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/russian-stock-analyst-drinks-to-death-of-the-stock-market.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/06/ukraine-russia-war-crimes/,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/politics/blinken-stoltenberg-no-fly-zone-warning/index.html,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/video/us-nato-oppose-fly-zone-ukraine-83293138,http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2013-12/05/content_2543057.htm,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/202203/t20220303_10647695.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/china-provide-ukraine-humanitarian-aid-praises-russia-ties-2022-03-07/,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202203/t20220301_10646858.html,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/china-banking-regulator-sees-limited-impact-sanctions-russia-2022-03-02/;China Falsely Accuses U.S. of Betraying Historic Ukraine Security Pact;;;;;;

He tweeted:“Unconfimred (sic) reports of #Russia/n hitting 13 bio-lab munitions throughout #Ukraine, some of them underground, so it took a few strikes to destroy them. The issue of foreign powers resarch (sic) bio labs in UKR is gaining traction in RUS media - watch this space”That is false.Suchov rehashes an old, well-debunked conspiracy theory the Kremlin and supportive news media have floated for years.Under the theory, purported U.S.-run biolabs in countries like Ukraine or Georgia are secretly experimenting with biological weapons, conducting tests on humans or accidentally leaking deadly pathogens into local communities.In Georgia, the bogus theory has centered on the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health, located near Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital. Russian officials and state media outlets have falsely claimed that the Lugar Lab, its popular name, was involved in everything from the poisoning of Russian dissident Alexey Navalny to the spread of COVID-19. In fact, the Center for Public Health conforms to World Health Organization standards. In 2018, the center invited Russia to send its own inspectors to the facility. The claims about biolabs in Ukraine are even less credible, as there is no evidence that such U.S. biolabs exist there.On February 25, the PolitiFact fact-checking website debunked the claim that “Russia is targeting U.S. biological weapons labs in Ukraine invasion,” reporting that no such labs exist in that country.“There are no U.S. military-run labs in Ukraine, said Andy Weber, a member of the Arms Control Association Board of Directors and a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs,” PolitiFact wrote. PolitiFact also quoted Weber as saying that the U.S. has an arrangement with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health “to improve public health laboratories and prevent the threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases.”Stories about non-existent U.S.-run biolabs in Ukraine have been a staple of Russian disinformation since the conflict began after Moscow illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.In 2017, Russian state media reported that pro-Russian hackers in Ukraine had found information that a U.S.-run biolab was carrying out biological weapons experiments in Ukraine. Such stories lack any concrete evidence and are typically based on innuendo about innocuous real events. For example, Russian state media reports in 2017 seized on a visit by a representative of an international HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis institute who met with defense and National Guard officials. The actual purpose of the visit was to educate personnel on the danger of HIV and other diseases, as well as how to prevent their outbreak.That same year, some pro-Russian websites spread the claim that biological weapons testing was responsible for an outbreak of measles in Ukraine. In reality, the outbreak had been due to parents not vaccinating their children.With Russia’s full-on invasion of Ukraine, unsubstantiated claims continue. On March 7, Igor Kirillov, head of Russian military’s chemical, biological and radiation protection force, claimed that Ukrainian biolabs were experimenting with deadly pathogens.""The analysis of disposal acts indicates experiments were staged with pathogens of plague, anthrax and brucellosis at a biolaboratory in Lvov and with pathogens of diphtheria, salmonellosis and dysentery at laboratories in Kharkov and Poltava,"" Russia's TASS state news agency quoted Kirillov as saying. It is difficult to know how the Russian military could have carried out such analyses, given that Russian forces have not yet managed to take control of Kharkiv and that no Russian troops are anywhere near Lviv. As indicated above, Ukraine does have public health laboratories devoted to preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-lawmaker-suggests-u-s-or-georgia-produced-navalny-poison/30819501.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/it-just-won-t-die-russian-claim-that-virus-began-as-u-s-bioweapon/30523610.html,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/25/tweets/there-are-no-us-run-biolabs-ukraine-contrary-socia/,https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukraine-a-us-biological-testing-site/,https://blogs.unicef.org/blog/sad-inevitability-of-measles-in-ukraine/,http://tass.com/world/1418311;Latest Russian Ukraine Disinfo - Phony ‘Biolab’ Claims;;;;;;

One triumphal piece by state-owned RIA Novosti news, two days into the invasion, even proclaimed Ukraine’s unconditional surrender. “Ukraine has returned to Russia,” it said.The piece was later deleted.In the fusillade of falsehoods from the Kremlin, one target stands out – Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president whose charismatic effort to rally his country has won global renown. A far different Zelenskyy is portrayed in the Russian media.The Kremlin's Zelenskyy is weak, a coward and untrustworthy, a mentally unstable leader who has betrayed the Ukrainian people.According to the Russian state media, the West is disappointed in Zelenskyy and wants to replace him. At the same time, various Russian state media report that the West won’t let Zelenskyy flee, that the West has abandoned him, and that he has abandoned Ukraine and fled to Poland or elsewhere.The reports are all false, as anyone following independent media reports of the war and Zelenskyy’s actions have seen. In fact, Zelenskyy famously declined a U.S. offer to provide a safe exit, saying: “I don’t need a ride; I need ammunition.”In Russian media, the stream of falsehoods never ends.In one of the most outrageous, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the Russian state Duma (lower House) said on February 26: “All videos Zelenskyy has been posting on social media from Kyiv have been pre-recorded,” and that Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, “is actually hiding under the protection of Nazi guards.”Since the attack began, Zelenskyy has posted regular video updates on his Telegram channel. On February 26, he appeared in front of a building in Kyiv that has been identified as next to the presidential office.""There's a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there's evacuation,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our country.""Polygraph.info extracted the metadata from the February 26 video, and the creation date showed December 31, 1903, likely for security reasons. Zelenskyy has said he is the No. 1 target of the Russian forces. Western officials say Putin’s plan is to remove him and insert a puppet government. Zelenskyy has acknowledged danger but insisted he has no plans to leave.Citing intelligence sources, the U.K. newspaper The Times reported February 28 that 400 Russian mercenaries are operating in Kyiv with orders to assassinate Zelenskyy.The Russian tanks and missile launchers that rolled into Ukraine are marked with a large, white letter “Z” inside a square box. The mysterious sign has prompted fervid speculation on social media that it stood for Zelenskyy and signified his doom.But writing in Tablet Magazine on February 28, author and filmmaker Bernard-Henri Lévy recounted Zelenskyy’s transformation from a stand-up comic to political novice, to president to a historic figure who may reshape Europe. In “Ukraine’s Hero President Z.”, Lévy offers this explanation:“This man who prefers to die fighting than to suffer the dishonor of forced surrender, this comedian who yesterday seemed to say, ‘all is lost except honor,’ but who, this morning, after another night of bombings, finds the inner strength to inspire his people, and to tell them they are still free, is Putin’s nightmare.”";https://web.archive.org/web/20220226224717/https:/ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/26/ukraine-russia-zelensky-war/,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-russia.html,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/zelensky-ukraine-president-jewish-hero/622945/,https://russian.rt.com/ussr/news/968218-volodin-zelenskii-kiev-lvov?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/733,https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/735,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/volodymyr-zelensky-russian-mercenaries-ordered-to-kill-ukraine-president-cvcksh79d,https://www.the-sun.com/news/4752516/russia-tanks-z-symbol-meaning-ukraine-invasion/,https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/ukraines-hero-president-z;‘Z’ for Zelenskyy – Russian Propaganda’s Super Villain;;;;;;

Soldiers’ Families Fact-Check the Kremlin;2022-02-28;polygraph;;On February 28, Russia’s state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported that Russia’s Defense Ministry denied using conscripts in the war on Ukraine.“The Russian Defense Ministry stated that only officers and contractors are participating in the military operation in Ukraine,” RIA Novosti said on Twitter.That is false, based on what some soldiers’ families are claiming. The use of conscripts is controversial in Russia, where virtually all males between the ages of 18 and 27 must complete a one-year term of military service. Those who enlist voluntarily are known as kontraktniki, or contract soldiers, and they typically receive more training, serve longer periods and get better pay and benefits.Under Russian law, however, conscripts cannot be deployed outside of Russia.The country’s military has long sought to replace the outdated system of using draftees, or conscripts, with an all-volunteer contract force. Russia’s military managed in recent years to increase the proportion of contract soldiers to conscripts. On February 24, a day after Russia began pouring more forces into Ukraine, the Daily Beast reported that Russian conscripts had been threatened – even beaten – into signing contracts so that they could be deployed outside Russia. As evidence, the news outlet cited a report in the Russian news publication Takie Dela sourced to the Committee for Soldiers’ Mothers, one of Russia’s oldest non-governmental groups, which works to protect the rights of Russian military personnel. The committee reported that, in some cases, the status of entire military units was switched from conscript to contract soldier.The soldiers had been told they were going to the border of Ukraine strictly for exercises and never fully informed of the true mission – a war – until the invasion began.“There are facts of the use of physical violence, beatings of those who refuse to become contract soldiers. Further, complete uncertainty, as their phones are taken away,” Andrey Kurochkin, deputy chairman of the mothers’ committee told Takie Dela. “We've had a flurry of calls from scared mothers all over Russia. They cry, they don't know if their children are alive or healthy,” Kurochkin said.On February 25, the independent Russian media outlet Meduza confirmed that narrative after speaking to Russian parents whose sons were fulfilling their mandatory service but then were allegedly strong-armed into contract service. Some conscripts were allegedly sent into Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region before being deployed to a base on the Russian side of the border near Kharkiv in Ukraine.Meduza quoted one mother identified only as “Maria”:“My son told me he couldn’t say anything, everything was bugged and they were taking people’s phones away. As for himself, he said ‘everything’s fine,’ but what does ‘fine’ mean when you’re not allowed to say anything? And how can everything be fine in a war? I’ve been crying, not eating, just sitting there numbly and watching TV.“We have group chats just for the mothers of boys who are serving. And last week, one mother wrote, ‘Why are they sending conscripts? ’The next day, her son got punished by his commanding officer. How? Did they go into our chat and read it?’” The practice of forcing conscripts to sign on as contract soldiers is not new. In 2015, as Russia’s war in eastern Ukraine entered a lull, Russian conscripts reported being intimidated into signing contracts so they could be sent to Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.Also in 2015, the Ukrainian volunteer investigatory organization InformNapalm reported that Russian conscripts were forced to sign contracts despite not undergoing the normal battery of physical and psychological examinations for enlistees.Since Russia escalated the war on February 24, videos have been posted online showing captured Russian soldiers, some disarmed by lightly armed or even unarmed civilians. In other cases, they are in custody of the Ukrainian authorities, either military or law enforcement.In some of the videos, the Russian soldiers are seen calling their relatives in Russia and explaining their predicament.Ukrainians have set up a website and telephone hotline that Russian parents can use to locate relatives who may have been fighting in Ukraine.

They are not threatening the civilian population,” Konashenkov told reporters.That is false.Media reports, social media videos and first-hand reports from Ukraine offer abundant evidence of civilian casualties and damaged civilian structures from what U.S. officials say is an all-out effort to capture the capital of Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian government.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on February 25 that 137 people – soldiers and civilians – had been killed and 316 wounded during the first day of Russian invasion, which began early February 24.The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said February 25 that it had verified at least 127 civilian casualties, including 25 killed and 102 injured, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, The Associated Press reported.Voice of America's Eastern European division reported on February 25 that Ukraine's former General Prosecutor Gyunduz Mamedov ""said Friday that since Russia invaded, civilian casualties in Ukraine already total at least 42 civilians including 2 children.""Amnesty International said it documented three incidents in which at least six civilians were killed and 12 were injured. Amnesty cautioned that indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law and can constitute war crimes.“The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas. Some of these attacks may be war crimes,"" said Agnes Callamard, the Amnesty secretary-general. ""The Russian government, which falsely claims to use only precision-guided weapons, should take responsibility for these acts.”In the first few hours of the Russian invasion, the Ukraine Defense Ministry said Russian forces had struck airfields in Boryspil, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka. The ministry also said settlements on the Crimean border were shelled.In its first report of casualties on February 24, the Ukrainian government said Russian forces had targeted 25 cities. Ukrainian state foreign language broadcaster UATV reported that more than 50 people were killed and dozens injured in the initial Russian attacks and that dozens residential buildings were hit in several cities.Images from the city of Chuhuiv showed civilian homes that were destroyed, reportedly in a Russian missile strike. Firefighters rushed to the scene. A boy reportedly died in the strike. Ukraine’s Ukrinform news agency reported February 24 that Russian shells struck a hospital in Vuhledar, a city in the eastern Donetsk province, killing four civilians and injuring 10. Six of the injured were doctors, Ukrinform said.Ukraine’s Health Minister Viktor Liashko called Russian attacks on hospitals a violation of the Geneva Conventions governing international armed conflict.“Such actions of the occupiers are a direct threat to the life and health of the civilians and contradict the norms of international humanitarian law,” Liashko said on his official Facebook page.Citing Ukrainian authorities, Reuters reported Thursday (February 24) that 18 people were killed in a Russian missile attack in Ukraine’s southern Odessa region. The news agency also reported that six people died and twelve were injured in an attack in the town of Brovary near Kyiv. Many in Ukraine sought protection in underground shelters.In Kyiv, people carrying luggage spent the night in underground metro stations. CBS News reported that people in Kharkiv, a city in eastern Ukraine near its borders with Russia, gathered in subway stations and parked trains. The United Nations’ refugee agency said the Russian offensive triggered an enormous migration inside the country and across borders as Ukrainians fled for safety.The agency's High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said on February 25 via Twitter that ""more than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours – a majority to Poland and Moldova – and many more are moving towards its borders.""A majority of those fleeing are likely to move to the western border countries of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Romania, reported CNBC.Moldovan President Maia Sandu said on February 24 that more than 4,000 civilians had entered the country from Ukraine and that temporary placement centers were set up near Palanca and Ocnita.Poland’s border service said 29,000 people had arrived from Ukraine on February 24, The New York Times reported.The U.S. government estimated that the Russian invasion could prompt 1 million to 5 million Ukrainians to flee. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry estimated 3 million to 5 million potential refugees, reported CNBC.Ukrainian officials said Russian troops had attacked a kindergarten and an orphanage, in Okhtyrka, a small city in the northeast Sumy province, Newsweek reported. The number of casualties has not been confirmed.The Conflict Intelligence Team, a Moscow group that collects open-source intelligence, said it confirmed the location of a photo of the Sumy kindergarten and that a woman and a child appeared to have been killed. (Note: The photograph contains graphic material that may offend some readers.)Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a war crimes investigation.Ukrainian defense officials said on the morning of February 25 that there had been multiple missile strikes in Kyiv, and that a residential building had been hit, The New York Times reported.As night fell, Ukrainian forces battled Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million.Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated that civilians weren’t being attacked. “No strikes are being conducted on civilian infrastructure,” Lavrov insisted.President Zelenskyy called that “a lie” in a TV address to the nation. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them,"" he said. ""They do not distinguish in which areas to operate.”";https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-moscow-kyiv-626a8c5ec22217bacb24ece60fac4fe1,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHaISDbXes,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-invades-ukraine-biden-accuses-putin-of-premeditated-war/6456628.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-media-united-nations-kyiv-3500e852f1a812a23dc9ff492ca2af08,http://www.voanews.com/a/duplicated-latest-developments-in-ukraine-feb-25/6458585.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/russian-military-commits-indiscriminate-attacks-during-the-invasion-of-ukraine/,http://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/2022/02/24/address-by-the-commander-in-chief-of-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-lieutenant-general-valery-zaluzhny/,http://www.rferl.org/a/putin-ukraine-military-operation/31719680.html/,http://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=921883541816048&ref=sharing,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/2/24/photos-aftermath-of-russian-air-strikes-in-ukraines-kharkiv,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3411345-in-chuhuiv-enemy-shell-hit-apartment-building-killing-a-boy.html,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3411687-russian-military-shells-hit-hospital-in-vuhledar-4-civilians-killed-10-wounded.html,https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions,https://www.facebook.com/viktor.liashko/posts/2567780533354055,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/18-people-killed-ukraines-odessa-missile-attack-regional-authorities-2022-02-24/,http://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/russia-ukraine-invasion-donbas-troops-today/#post-update-b61ea361,http://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-needs-in-ukraine-escalate-as-crisis-intensifies/6459137.html,https://twitter.com/FilippoGrandi/status/1497236234950918150,http://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/ukraine-crisis-poland-neighbors-ready-for-influx-of-migrants.html,http://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/24/world/russia-attacks-ukraine#thousands-of-ukrainians-are-crossing-the-border-into-eastern-poland,http://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/ukraine-crisis-poland-neighbors-ready-for-influx-of-migrants.html,https://www.newsweek.com/russia-attacks-ukraine-kindergarten-orphanage-sumy-oblast-shelter-casualties-reported-1682656,https://twitter.com/CITeam_en/status/1497204834314948620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1497204834314948620%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygraph.info%2Fa%2Ffact-check-russian-strike-ukrainian-cities-civilians%2F31723844.html,http://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/24/world/russia-attacks-ukraine#china-walks-a-fine-line-on-russia-even-after-its-invasion-of-ukraine,https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/russia-ukraine-invasion-donbas-troops-today/#post-update-48877070,http://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/24/world/russia-attacks-ukraine#china-walks-a-fine-line-on-russia-even-after-its-invasion-of-ukraine;Moscow's Hollow Pledge to Avoid Civilian Harm in Attack on Ukraine;;;;;;

Notably, the security features built into the devices meant that only Moscow had actual control of them.With its 2014 annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, Russia has violated Ukraine’s borders and effectively nullified the Budapest agreement. As such, Ukrainian officials such as Ambassador to Germany Andrii Melnyk have speculated that Ukraine might have to rethink its non-nuclear status. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested the Budapest agreement is obsolete, The Moscow Times reported.As the BBC noted in a fact check of Putin’s speech, however, Ukraine’s government has not announced that it plans to build nuclear weapons, nor does the country’s national defense strategy mention nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has found no evidence that Ukraine has diverted nuclear energy resources to make weapons.Nuclear weapons are very hard to manufacture and deploy, which is one reason so few nations possess them. Nations like North Korea that acquired nuclear weapons in contravention of non-proliferation treaties took decades to develop warheads.Moreover, the United States has never suggested deploying nuclear warheads in Ukraine. A day ahead of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine, The New York Times reported:""Ukraine gave up a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons left over by the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and used the fuel from its blended-down warheads to drive its nuclear power plants. Today Ukraine does not even have the basic infrastructure to produce nuclear fuel, though Mr. Putin made the dubious claim that it could pick that talent up quickly.""For their part, American officials have said repeatedly that they have no plans to place nuclear weapons in the country — and never have, especially since Ukraine is not a member of NATO.""";https://nucleardiner.wordpress.com/2022/02/06/could-ukraine-have-retained-soviet-nuclear-weapons/,https://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082124528/ukraine-russia-putin-invasion,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/23/genocide-and-nuclear-bombs-putins-unfounded-claims-a76543,https://www.bbc.com/news/60477712,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/us/politics/putin-ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html;More Putin Disinfo: Bizarre Claim About Ukrainian Nukes;;;;;;
104;;;;Misleading;Hua Chunying;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-china-denial-invasion/6743291.html;China Refuses To Call Moscow’s Ukraine Invasion What It Is;2022-02-25;polygraph;;On Friday, February 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about Russia’s new war with Ukraine.Xi told Putin that China supports Russia “in solving the issue” through negotiation with Ukraine, China’s Xinhua news agency reported.Despite a supposed longstanding policy of “non-interference” in the internal affairs of other countries, China has refused to label the war an “invasion.”As Russian tanks rolled toward Kyiv, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying was asked by reporters on February 24 whether she would call Russia’s attacks an invasion. Hua did not give a straight answer.“Regarding the definition of an invasion, I think we should go back to how to view the current situation in Ukraine,” Hua said. “The Ukrainian issue has [a] very complicated historical background that has continued to today.”That is a misleading evasion.Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s false claims that Ukraine never had “real statehood” or needs to be “de-nazified,” Ukraine has been an independent state since 1991. In 1994, Russia signed a treaty, the Budapest Memorandum, which pledged to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity.Russia’s distortions of Ukrainian history do nothing to change the fact that Moscow launched a multi-front, air, land and sea invasion of Ukraine, widely condemned by Western countries as a violation of international law.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the largest in Europe since World War II.On February 25, Russia continued to bomb Kyiv, with a rocket crashing into a residential building, The New York Times and other news outlets reported. The Times also reported that, for months, U.S. officials repeatedly pleaded with Beijing to encourage Russian not to invade Ukraine but were rebuffed.As fighting raged, the United States warned that Russia’s military is seeking to “decapitate” Ukraine’s democratically elected government and install a puppet regime, and has compiled lists of Ukrainians to kill or “send to camps.”Russian special forces and airborne troops have closed in on Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russian saboteurs had entered the city and that he was Moscow’s prime target.The Ukrainian military continues to fight. In a midnight video address on February 25, Zelenskyy said 137 people, both soldiers and civilians, were killed and 316 people wounded during the first day of Russia’s invasion.While Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that its attacks have only targeted Ukraine’s military infrastructure, and that “nothing threatens” Ukraine’s “civilian population,” news and social media reports said Russian strikes hit residential areas and hospitals.Civilians across Ukraine have been forced to take shelter in metro stations and other bunkers as Russian missiles rain down on the county.On the eve of war, Chinese state media attempted to whitewash the Kremlin’s decision to recognize the Russian-occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent states.Rather than call out Russia’ unilateral act of aggression, China falsely accused the United States of breaking a Cold War promise to the Soviet Union not to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).As Polygraph.info previously noted, China has regularly cited “the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs” to shield authoritarian regimes from rights abuses against their own people.That has included vetoing United Nations resolutions to punish the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against his own people.On the eve of the Winter Games in Beijing earlier this month, Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership, under which China expressed support for Russia’s aggressive posture against Ukraine.;https://english.news.cn/20220225/48d17172b6a24125961ed778deed5c40/c.html,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/05/why-care-about-ukraine-and-the-budapest-memorandum/,https://time.com/6150046/ukraine-statehood-russia-history-putin/,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/24/world/russia-attacks-ukraine,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/us/politics/us-china-russia-ukraine.html,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-joe-biden-world-war-ii-europe-013df0a4b123e5810ad9733ee1e710b2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/20/ukraine-russia-human-rights/,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/zelensky-says-russian-saboteurs-are-in-kyiv-and-he-is-moscows-prime-target.html,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-25/ukraine-schools-and-subways-become-bomb-shelters-and-gun-ranges/100860338,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-blames-us-ukraine/31721326.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-china-tell-nato-stop-expansion-moscow-backs-beijing-taiwan-2022-02-04/;China Refuses To Call Moscow’s Ukraine Invasion What It Is;;;;;;
105;;;;False;Wang Wenbin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-ukraine-america-destabilization/6743281.html;China Toes Russian Propaganda Line on Ukraine Threat and Economy;2022-02-17;polygraph;;"On February 16, a reporter with Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency asked Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin for his assessment of the situation in Ukraine.The reporter prefaced her question by noting that Russia’s Defense Ministry had announced some Russian troops were being moved away from the border with Ukraine, and from Crimea, “following military drills.”The reporter said the alleged pullback came after Western media competed “to predict the date of an alleged Russian invasion of Ukraine.”Wang sided with Russia.“For days, the U.S. has been playing up the threat of war and creating an air of tension,” he said. “This has gravely impacted the economy, social stability and people’s lives in Ukraine, and added obstacles to advancing dialogue and negotiation between parties concerned.”Wang cited a Russian accusation that the West “has resorted to ‘information terrorism’ on the Ukraine issue,” thanks to “the failure of Western propaganda.”That is false.What’s destabilizing is Russia’s massive troop buildup on Ukraine’s border and a wave of Kremlin disinformation misrepresenting its prior attacks on Ukraine, fostering rumors and even demonizing Ukrainians as Nazi sympathizers.Furthermore, Ukraine’s economy has been reeling ever since Russia attacked the country in 2014 and because of the resulting war and aggression from the Kremlin.Although Russia now claims to have withdrawn some troops, the United States and its allies claimed on February 16 that Russia is actually bringing up more forces.As tensions have ramped up in recent months, Ukraine for years has felt the economic and social impacts of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and clandestine invasion of eastern Ukraine.Russian forces without identification (so-called ""litte green men"") at the airport in Simferopol, Crimea on February 28, 2014.Writing in Investment Monitor, Sebastian Shehadi and Jon Whiteaker cited World Bank Data showing that tourism arrivals and foreign direct investment in Ukraine have “failed to rejuvenate since 2014.”Vasyl Myroshnychenko, CEO of CFC Big Ideas and a co-founder of the Ukraine Crisis Media Center, told Investment Monitor that Ukraine has ""been struggling to attract foreign capital” for eight years.He argued that making Ukraine “unattractive to international investors” is part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plan.According to Jorge Guira, associate professor of law and finance at the U.K.’s University of Reading, Russia’s troop buildup “may be a bluff to weaken the Ukrainian economy and sow European discord.”RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan expressed support on social media for Ukraine’s economic misfortunes. (RT, formerly Russia Today, is state-owned.)“Kyiv’s economy is torn to shreds … a small matter, but pleasant,” she tweeted, adding that the “departing tanks” could return just as quickly.Further undermining Ukraine’s social and economic stability, Ukraine’s defense ministry, army and banking systems were hit with cyberattacks on February 16. A top Ukrainian cybersecurity official called the cyber operation the largest of its kind in the country’s history, The New York Times reported.Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, said the cyberattacks were “meant to destabilize, to sow panic, to do everything to create a certain chaos in the actions of Ukrainians in our country.”Ilya Vityuk, head of the Ukrainian Intelligence Agency’s Cyber Security Department, blamed Russia for the attacks.“We know today that, unfortunately, the only country that is interested in such strikes on our country, especially against the background of mass panic over a possible military invasion is, unfortunately, the Russian Federation,” the Times quoted him as saying.The White House warned earlier in February that “Russia could use cyberattacks as part of its efforts to destabilize and further invade Ukraine.”The threat of a Russian invasion has also prompted some insurance providers to refuse airlines coverage for operations in Ukrainian airspace.On February 14, the Kyiv Independent reported that Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry had announced a $590 million fund for “guaranteeing the safety of flights through Ukraine for insurance companies, reinsurers, leasing companies and airlines.”Some airlines were already avoiding flying in portions of Ukraine’s airspace after a Russian missile system was used to down Malaysia Airlines flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. That attack killed all 298 people on board.On February 15, the Joint War Committee, a maritime insurance advisory body, added Ukrainian and Russian waters in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to its “JWC Hull War, Piracy, Terrorism and Related Perils” — its highest risk category.The JWC says shipping companies operating in these areas “are required to notify [insurance] underwriters of voyages. “On February 10, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Russia of blocking parts of the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and the Kerch Strait (which connects the two seas) “under the pretext of holding regular naval exercises.”Elisabeth Braw of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, wrote that the “JWC’s decision could mean serious delivery disruptions for Russia and Ukraine.”“Ukraine thus faces the loss of many of the 1,000 ships that call [to the region] each month. And companies will struggle to deliver the country’s top imports—which include refined petroleum, packaged medicines and coal briquettes—via air or rail,” Braw wrote.Russia has repeatedly been accused of blockading Ukrainian shipping through the Kerch Strait.In November 2018, after firing on Ukrainian ships and detaining Ukrainian sailors earlier that month, Ukraine's then Minister of Infrastructure Volodymyr Omelyan told Polygraph.info Russia had instituted an ""economic blockade of [the] Azov Sea.""The issue has persisted.In December 2021, Ukraine's Navy said Russia ""has blocked about 70 percent of the Azov Sea.""Still, some senior Ukrainian officials have accused the United States and Western media of damaging Ukraine’s economy by talking up the possibility of war.In late January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the United States, saying talk of a potential Russian invasion was damaging Ukraine’s economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky examines weapons as he attends tactical military exercises held by the country's armed forces at a training ground in the Rivne Region on February 16, 2022.At that time, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told The Associated Press that 120,000 Russian troops were concentrated near Ukraine. He said then that they could stage provocations, but that his government had not seen preparations for a full-scale invasion.“The preparatory period that will be noticed by the entire world could take from three to seven days,” Danilov said. “We aren’t seeing it yet. We clearly understand what’s going on and we are calmly preparing for it.”Danilov also criticized Germany for refusing to provide arms to Ukraine. At the same time, Zelensky asked for and received weapons from the United States and other NATO countries to protect against a potential Russian invasion.U.S. officials said on February 16 that Russia had moved an additional 7,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden said 150,000 Russian troops were amassed around Ukraine.On February 17, Biden said the risk of invasion remains ""very high.”David Arakhamia, who leads Zelenskiy’s Servant of the People faction in Ukraine’s parliament, accused some Western media outlets of spreading “blatant fake news” about the threat of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine, and said that such reports were costing the country “2-3 billion dollars every month,” The New Voice of Ukraine reported. Arakhamia provided no evidence for that figure.Some online commentators have questioned Arakhamia’s claims, noting that Zelensky recently thanked Canada for a $500 million loan, while Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked Western partners for their “enhanced political, security and economic support to Ukraine.”“Its total volume in recent weeks and months has exceeded 1.5 billion dollars, while a total weight of defensive weapons and military equipment delivered to Ukraine has gone beyond 1,000 tonnes,"" Kuleba said.On February 14, the U.S. State Department announced it was “offering a sovereign loan guarantee to Ukraine of up to $1 billion.”The State Department also noted that the United States “has provided over $2 billion in development assistance to Ukraine since 2014.”Meantime, some media reports say that the U.S. intelligence releases are helping deter war.A senior U.S. official told CNN that “Putin has been caught off guard” by some of the intelligence releases. CNN reported that “intelligence intercepts have picked up Russian military and intelligence officials grumbling about the exposure of their plans.”";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-false-ukraine/31707120.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-margarita-simonyan-concentration-camps/31705120.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-pullout-meets-uk-scepticism-ukraine-defence-website-still-hacked-2022-02-16/,https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/analysis/ukraine-russia-business-impact-investment,https://theconversation.com/ukraine-the-economic-impact-of-tension-with-russia-is-part-of-putins-long-term-plan-176266,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/world/europe/ukraine-cyberattack.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-cybersecurity-official-europe-warning-russian-hacks-2022-02-02/,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/14/ukrainian-airline-moves-some-jets-to-spain-after-insurance-bans-coverage-amid-russia-crisis.html,https://kyivindependent.com/national/ukrainian-government-puts-up-590-million-in-aircraft-insurance-to-keep-air-traffic-going-amid-war-threat/,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/13/ukraine-vows-to-keep-airspace-open-despite-russia-threat-a76364,https://www.lmalloyds.com/lma/jointwar,https://mfa.gov.ua/en/news/statement-ministry-foreign-affairs-ukraine-decision-russian-federation-block-parts-black-sea-and-sea-azov-and-kerch-strait,https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/the-last-thing-ukraine-needs-is-a-shipping-crisis-but-its-about-to-have-one-russia-conflict,https://www.polygraph.info/a/peskov-denies-blockade-of-ukraine-bound-shipping-through-kerch-strait-/29630931.html,https://112.international/russia/russia-blocks-about-70-of-azov-sea-ukrainian-navy-67645.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/28/ukraine-accuses-us-of-hurting-economy-by-stoking-panic-over-war,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-france-germany-europe-d9a2ed365b58d35274bf0c3c18427e81,https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-requests-west-send-more-weapons-criticizes-germany-refusing-1674699,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60158694,https://nv.ua/ukraine/politics/arahamiya-sravnil-cnn-bloomberg-wsj-so-skabeevoy-i-solovevym-novosti-ukrainy-50216679.html,https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3399120-kuleba-on-record-high-support-to-ukraine-15b-over-1000-tonnes-of-weapons.html,https://ua.usembassy.gov/u-s-action-to-strengthen-ukraines-economy/,https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-us-ramped-its-information-war-russia,https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/biden-administration-russia-intelligence/index.html;China Toes Russian Propaganda Line on Ukraine Threat and Economy;;;;;;
106;;;;False;Denis Golenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-ukraine-embassy/6743282.html;Smoke (Literal) and Disinfo From the Russian Embassy in Ukraine;2022-02-17;polygraph;;On February 17 a channel called “Main News from Kyiv-44.ua” in the Russian messaging app Telegram posted a video of smoke rising from a building’s rooftop next to a Russian flag.A male voice on the video noted that the smoke was from the Russian Embassy in Kyiv and that the only other time he had seen this was in 2014, when Russia moved against Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and Donbas.Russia’s initial attack on Ukraine began in February 2014 when military personnel dressed in uniforms without insignias moved into Crimea. The subsequent war in Donbas has killed more than 14,000.The Russian embassy video quickly spilled over onto other social platforms and went viral. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) social media accounts established the video’s authenticity.British political analyst Kyle Orton said that the smoke means Moscow is preparing to evacuate its diplomatic staff from Kyiv amid predictions that Russia will launch a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine. According to the United States and other Western countries, some 150,000 troops are poised near Ukraine’s borders.“The obvious explanation is that it is the burning of classified documents in advance of a withdrawal,” Orton tweeted.Asked about the smoke, the Russian Embassy in Kyiv denied anything out of ordinary was happening. The embassy’s press attaché, Denis Golenko, told Russia’s state-owned RIA Novosti news agency:“Work is proceeding on a regular schedule. Nothing extraordinary is happening here.”That is false.On February 10, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow “likely will advise the non-essential personnel of our diplomatic offices (in Ukraine) to temporarily return home.”Moscow has not commented officially about whether that process has begun. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s website was down on February 17, with a “technical error” page offering the ministry’s apologies for the inconvenience.Yanking embassy workers home isn’t “regular” business.Moreover, on February 17, Russia expelled the deputy chief of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Moscow, Bart Gorman, in what the U.S. State Department called an “unprovoked” and “escalatory step.” The Kremlin claimed Gorman was booted in response to the expulsion of a “minister” from Russia’s Embassy in Washington, D.C., but provided no details.Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated on February 17 that the Kremlin has no intention of attacking Ukraine, contending that “it is the West that has been escalating the situation.” Russia announced it was withdrawing some of its estimated 150,000 troops amassed near Ukraine’s borders.The U.S. and its NATO allies believe the Kremlin’s denials and the purported troop withdrawals are “a false flag operation,” and that Russia is prepared to move against Ukraine.U.S. President Joe Biden said on February 17 that a “very high” probability remains that Russia will attack Ukraine in the next few days.“They have not moved any of their troops out. They have moved more troops in,” he said. “We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag operation, to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine and attack Ukraine.”On February 17, the British Defense Ministry tweeted a map that “demonstrates President Putin's possible axis of invasion.”“Russia retains a significant military presence that can conduct an invasion without further warning,” the ministry said.The exact cause of the smoke apparently rising from the Russian Embassy in Kyiv remains unexplained. The embassy did not deny that there was smoke. Instead, official comments suggested the smoke was not caused by a fire or any other emergency.Similar videos surfaced in 2017, when pillars of thick smoke were recorded rising from Russian embassies and consulates prior to their forced closure because of alleged Kremlin meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.At that time, the staff of Russian consulate in San Francisco turned away local firemen who responded to reports of a heavy smoke. The “people who came from inside the building” told the firefighters that “there was no problem, and that consulate staff were burning unidentified items in a fireplace,” The Associated Press reported in September 2017.The San Francisco consulate was one of three Russian diplomatic missions that then-U.S. President Donald Trump ordered shut in retaliation for evidence of interference (in which U.S. intelligence assessments said were aimed at helping Trump win.) Previously, under President Barak Obama, the U.S. expelled some 35 Russian diplomats the White House said were undercover spies.In retaliation for the 2017 closure of its diplomatic missions in the U.S., Russia ordered the expulsion of 755 U.S. diplomats.;https://www.44.ua/news/3331412/unictozaut-sekretnye-dokumenty-v-kieve-iz-posolstva-rossii-idet-dym-video,https://twitter.com/COUPSURE/status/1494249684667412480?s=20&t=vPtaIJGXuH2LfB5frNNVCg,https://twitter.com/OsintUpdates/status/1494274810158862339?s=20&t=vPtaIJGXuH2LfB5frNNVCg,https://twitter.com/KyleWOrton/status/1494262178404306950?s=20&t=VKNMqslb_zLsWwNDKvGsSA,https://lenta.ru/news/2022/02/10/00383877282/,https://www.mid.ru/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-us-diplomat-bart-gorman-expelled-embassy-moscow/,https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-latest-russia-expels-deputy-chief-of-us-mission/a-60808178,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20220217/peskov-1773429339.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-says-troops-are-leaving-evidence-says-not-so-fast/31708923.html,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-expects-putin-ukraine-invasion-days/story?id=82954609,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/17/02/2022/620e2cb29a79477c56867708,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-smoke-chimney-russian-consulate-san-francisco/,https://apnews.com/article/moscow-north-america-us-news-ca-state-wire-san-francisco-9549026d1ed946e98d5119c785f2a388,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38484735,https://www.newsweek.com/does-russia-want-cold-war-putin-removes-us-diplomats-touts-military-warships-643968;Smoke (Literal) and Disinfo From the Russian Embassy in Ukraine;;;;;;
107;;;;False;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-false-ukraine/6743280.html;A False Claim From Putin About the Ukraine War;2022-02-16;polygraph;;On February 15, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin hosted a Kremlin meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who arrived from Ukraine to call for peace.Speaking at a joint news conference with Scholz after their meeting, Putin said Russia does not want war in Europe, and he blamed his country’s ongoing military escalation on the United States, NATO, and Ukraine.“Opportunities to peacefully restore the territorial integrity of the country through direct dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk are still ignored,” he said, referring to territories in eastern Ukraine where Moscow instigated armed conflict in 2014. Russia has since sustained the conflict there by providing pro-Russian forces with arms and leadership.Putin’s claim that dialogue has been “ignored” is false.Alexander Vershbow, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C, and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia (2001-2005), described Putin’s statement as “standard Russian propaganda.”“These distortions are aimed at convincing Russian domestic audiences, and less well-informed people in other countries, that Ukraine is to blame for the current impasse,” Vershbow said.Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine (1998-2000), told Polygraph.info that Putin's claim “simply does not comport with reality.”Russia has been pushing Ukraine to agree to a role for the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR) and “Luhansk People’s Republic” (LNR) in negotiations to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine views Russia as a party to the war, which has killed an estimated 14,000, and the two so-called “republics” as Russian puppets, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters on February 10.“If Ukraine agrees to this, then the status of Russia will change from being a party to the conflict to the status of being a mediator in the conflict. That is why we do not go for it,” Kuleba said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded by comparing Kuleba to Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Germany’s propaganda minister during WWII.Although “the Kremlin claims that Russia is not a party to the conflict in Donbas, Mr. Putin knows it is very much involved,” Pifer said. “There is little reason for Kyiv to conduct direct dialogue now with the so-called authorities in the part of Donbas controlled by Russia and Russian proxy forces, because the real decisions will be taken in Moscow.”Russia is pushing the idea that the Minsk Accords are the only path to peacefully resolve the conflict. They were negotiated in the capital of Belarus in 2014-2015, adopted under the patronage of France and Germany and meant to bring about an immediate ceasefire.“Seven years later, a new leadership in Kyiv argues that the fulfillment of all its terms is unpalatable and politically impossible,” VOA’s Eurasia bureau chief Myroslava Gongadze wrote on February 10. “[T]he [Minsk] deal is widely seen by the Ukrainian public as a betrayal of their national interests. Especially troublesome is the call for constitutional reform, which many believe would give the pro-Russian separatists a veto over Ukraine’s foreign policy.”Russia’s demands that the DNR and LNR be granted a special status under the Minsk accords “go way beyond any reasonable definition of autonomy,” Duncan Allan and Kataryna Wolczuk of the London-based think tank Chatham House wrote in a February 16 explainer.“Moscow wants an extreme version of autonomy and insists this is written into Ukraine’s constitution, meaning that following formal reintegration into Ukraine these mini states would be essentially independent of Kyiv. This would embed Russian influence into Ukraine’s political system, compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty from within.”NATO has rejected Putin’s demand that Ukraine be banned from joining the alliance. However, should the constitutional reforms in Ukraine that Russia is pushing be implemented, they would give the DNR and LNR a veto over Ukrainian foreign policy, Gongadze wrote. That could help Russia achieve its goal of precluding NATO membership for Ukraine by sabotaging any vote on the issue in Ukraine’s parliament.“The Russians erroneously say the Minsk agreements require direct dialogue between the Ukrainians and the separatists, and claim Russia is not a party to the conflict,” Vershbow told Polygraph.info. “The Ukrainians only engage the separatists in the Trilateral Contact group where they are part of the Russian delegation.” The Trilateral Contact Group consists of representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the 57-member Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In this format, the Russian delegation includes representatives of the DNR and LNR.Russia denies involvement in the Donbas war, claiming the conflict is a popular uprising by locals dissatisfied with Kyiv’s policies and seeking independence from Ukraine.However, there is abundant evidence of the Kremlin’s extensive participation.Among other things, Russia’s Wagner private military group lists some of the DNR/LNR leaders killed in the conflict as “Our heroes” on its official website. In the past, Russia included some of those Wagner mercenaries in its delegation at negotiations in Minsk.On February 14, the ruling United Russia Party adopted a resolution in the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, calling on Putin to recognize Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent sovereign states. Earlier in February, Putin ordered Russian social services agencies to pay pensions and benefits to Donbas residents whether or not they could provide proof of Russian citizenship.In May 2021, Putin ordered that Russian passports be issued en masse to Donbas residents. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said the move was a first step in Russia’s annexation of the region, drawing parallels with Moscow’s illegal grab of Crimea.In his February 15 remarks about territorial integrity, Putin ignored the status of Crimea, which remains a Ukrainian territory under international law.On February 14, Russia said it would be pulling back some of the troops it had massed near Ukraine’s borders in recent months. The United States has not yet verified the withdrawal, and U.S. President Joe Biden said that some 150,000 Russian troops remain near those borders.;http://prezident.org/tekst/stenogramma-press-konferencija-po-itogam-rossiisko-germanskih-peregovorov-15-02-2022.html,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/alexander-sandy-vershbow/,https://www.brookings.edu/experts/steven-pifer/,https://www.euronews.com/2022/02/12/us-ukraine-crisis-talks-russia,https://www-kommersant-ru.translate.goog/doc/5207534?from=spot&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://www.voanews.com/a/can-the-minsk-accords-be-implemented-/6436806.html,https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/02/why-minsk-2-cannot-solve-ukraine-crisis,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/russia-demands-ukraine-ex-soviet-nations-barred-from-nato/ar-AARUPdk,https://www.voanews.com/a/can-the-minsk-accords-be-implemented-/6436806.html,https://euromaidanpress.com/minsk-agreements-faq/,https://www.osce.org/,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=donbas&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/11/15/russias-61st-separate-naval-infantry-brigade-donbass/,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/26/russia-ruling-party-urges-the-kremlin-to-arm-ukraine-separatists-a76161,https://kyivindependent.com/national/russian-court-openly-documents-moscows-military-presence-in-donbas/,https://wagnera.ru/,https://wagnera.ru/nashi_geroi/arsen-pavlov-motorola,https://wagnera.ru/nashi_geroi/aleksandr-zaharchenko,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/14/russian-lawmakers-to-urge-putin-to-recognize-breakaway-ukraine-regions-independence-a76378,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-05-20/ukraine-sees-russias-issuance-of-passports-in-eastern-ukraine-as-step-towards-annexation,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=crimea&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/russia-ukraine/?id=82467772;A False Claim From Putin About the Ukraine War;;;;;;
108;;;;False;Zhao Lijian;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-meddling-in-australian-politics/6743278.html;History Contradicts China's Denial of Meddling in Australian Politics;2022-02-16;polygraph;;"On February 11, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian was asked to comment on Australian media reports that Chinese spies sought “to fund candidates for Australia’s opposition Labor Party in an upcoming federal election.”Mike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), the country’s counter-espionage agency, had said on February 9 that his agency thwarted a foreign interference plot led by a wealthy businessman with deep connections with a foreign power.“I’ll call this person ‘the puppeteer’,” he said, without naming the individual, country behind the plot or which election was targeted.Unnamed security sources not authorized to speak publicly confirmed to Australian media that China’s intelligence service was behind the plot.According to reports by The Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) and The Age, the plot aimed to bankroll Labor Party candidates from the state of New South Wales in the federal election set for May.On February 11, Zhao dismissed the Australian media reports as “not worth refuting at all.”“China has no interest in and has never interfered in Australia’s internal affairs,” he said.That is false.In fact, for years there have been reports alleging that China conducted malign influence activities aimed at manipulating Australian politics and civil society.These have included political donations linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and used to buy access and influence in major Australian political parties, as well as CCP-linked efforts to co-opt and control Chinese-language media and the Chinese diaspora in Australia.Evidence shows China attempted to shape discussion and silence criticism on Australian university campuses, and exploited Australian-funded scientific research to support the modernization of its People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“Australia is the canary in the coal mine of Chinese Communist Party interference,” wrote John Garnaut, former senior adviser to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.In June 2017, a joint investigation by ABC and Fairfax Media revealed that ASIO identified billionaire property developers Huang Xiangmo and Chau Chak Wing, two of Australia’s biggest political donors and both of Chinese descent, as suspected agents of CCP interference in Australian politics.According to the joint investigation, in 2015, then-ASIO chief Duncan Lewis secretly warned top officials of Australia’s major political parties against accepting donations from the two men.ASIO believed the two developers had deep connections to the Chinese Communist Party, and that their political cash “might come with strings attached,” the report said.Chau is an Australian citizen. Huang, a Chinese national, acquired permanent residency in Australia and applied for Australian citizenship.The two men, directly or through associated entities, donated approximately 6.7 million Australian dollars over a decade, the joint investigation revealed. The donations were often made in the lead up to federal or state election campaigns.Among the ABC-Fairfax report’s most notorious disclosures involved a 400,000 Australian-dollar donation that Huang promised to the Labor Party in the lead up to the 2016 federal election.Huang reportedly threatened to rescind the offer after Labor leadership condemned China’s island building in the South China Sea and voiced support for freedom-of-navigation operations.The day after Labor leadership condemned Beijing, Sen. Sam Dastyari, then a rising politician and Labor Party deputy whip, stood alongside Huang at a Chinese media conference in Sydney and parroted Beijing’s South China Sea talking points.According to the ABC-Fairfax report, there was no evidence Dastyari knew about Huang’s threat to cancel the donation. Dastyari initially denied making pro-China remarks, but leaked audio proved that he did. Dastyari reportedly also gave counter-surveillance advice to Huang in 2016, allegedly warning him that ASIO might have tapped his phone.Following those revelations, Dastyari resigned in December 2017.Earlier, media alleged that Huang and another CCP-linked ethnic Chinese donor had paid for Dastyari’s personal legal and travel bills, and that Dastyari had repeatedly contacted Australian immigration authorities personally to check on Huang’s citizenship application.Huang contributed millions to Australian universities, including 1.8 million Australian dollars to University of Technology Sydney to establish the Australian-China Relations Institute.The institute’s first director, Bob Carr, a former Australian foreign minister, described the think tank as holding an “unabashedly positive and optimistic view of the Australia-China relationship.”Huang also came under scrutiny for his links with the United Front Work Department (UFWD), a CCP lobbying entity accused of buying political influence abroad. He chaired the UFWD-linked Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China (ACPPRC).“Although the ACPPRC claims to be an independent civic organization, its leadership selection and activities are closely guided by the Chinese embassy in Canberra and local Chinese consulates,” wrote Amy Searight, senior associate for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in Washington, D.C.“China’s efforts to influence and shape public discourse and political outcomes beyond its borders go well beyond the legitimate public diplomacy that all governments engage in,” Searight added. “The CCP uses unofficial channels in ways that are opaque, deceptive, and manipulative to influence foreign governments and citizens – leaving the realm of legitimate public diplomacy far behind.”In 2019, Huang was stranded in Beijing after Australian authorities declared him unfit to hold Australian citizenship and stripped his permanent residency status.That decision was based on “a range of reasons, including character grounds,” the SMH reported, citing senior government sources. “They were also concerned about the reliability of his answers in interviews and correspondence with authorities including ASIO.”Huang criticized the Australian authorities’ decision.“It is profoundly disappointing to be treated in such a grotesquely unfair manner. The decision to cancel my visa was based on unfounded speculations that are prejudiced and groundless,” Huang told the Australian Financial Review.On February 14, Labor Party Sen. Kimberley Kitching identified Chau Chak Wing as the “puppeteer” the ASIO chief had accused of seeking to buy election candidates at the behest of a foreign power, Agence France-Presse reported.Chau denied Kitching’s allegation, calling it “baseless and reckless.”Australian parliamentarians and media have repeatedly accused Chau of covertly pushing the CCP’s interests. Chau has steadfastly denied the allegations and successfully sued local media for defamation, AFP reported.Chau’s real estate company, Kingold Group, is based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. He bought into a local newspaper in a joint venture with the Yangcheng Evening News Group, which is run by the provincial government’s propaganda department, the SMH reported in 2009. He is also a member of a provincial body that advises the CCP, according to The New York Times.In 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping greeted Chau during a gathering of former global leaders in Beijing. China’s vice president, Wang Qishan, gave a keynote speech at an event Chau organized at a resort he owned in Guangzhou, the Australian Financial Review reported.Australia was among the roughly one-third of the world’s countries that permitted foreign political donations. The United States, Canada, Britain and several European countries ban such donations.The Times wrote in 2017 that Australia’s then “largely unregulated” campaign financing system had led to what critics said was “a culture of soft corruption that Chinese donors have learned to exploit alongside other corporate interests.”In December 2017, then Australian Prime Minister Turnbull raised concerns about sophisticated political interference by foreign powers, specifically citing “disturbing reports about Chinese influence,” and announced that the country would ban foreign political donations.The ban was passed into law in 2018.That year, amid anxiety about Chinese influence, Australia also approved sweeping national security legislation. It criminalized any covert activity on behalf of a foreign government that aims to influence Australian politics and required foreign lobbyists to register on a public list.In June 2020, Australian police raided the homes of New South Wales state lawmaker Shaoquett Moselmane and his political adviser, John Shi Sheng Zhang. The warrants alleged that Zhang, Chinese-born Australian citizen, engaged with Moselmane “through a private social media chat group and other fora ... to advance the interests and policy goals of a foreign principal,” the Chinese government, the Associated Press reported.The raids became ""the first police investigation to grab public attention since the foreign interference laws came into force in 2018,"" noted AP.In May 2021, Zhang lost his challenge in Australia’s highest court over the validity of the search warrants executed by the police for the raid.In November 2020, former Liberal Party member Di Sanh Duong, an Australian citizen of Vietnamese-Chinese heritage who served on the boards of several Chinese-Australian community groups, became the first person to be arrested under the new law. He was charged in Melbourne with “preparing for a foreign interference offense” and granted bail.China has denied all the allegations of its influence activities in Australia, stating that it does not interfere in other countries’ affairs. It has also suggested that Australian’s new laws against such interference are motivated by xenophobia and racism.";https://www.reuters.com/world/china/australia-thwarts-chinese-plot-fund-election-candidates-media-2022-02-11/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-11/china-accused-attempt-bankroll-labor-candidates-federal-election/100822512,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/chinese-spies-attempted-to-install-labor-candidates-in-federal-election-20220211-p59vmj.html,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-09/how-china-interferes-australia,https://www.afr.com/politics/asio-warned-politicians-about-taking-cash-from-huang-xiangmo-chau-chak-wing-20170605-gwktc9#ixzz4j8s5RpMB,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/world/australia/sam-dastyari-resigns-china.html?_r=0,https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/2122307/australian-lawmaker-sam-dastyari-resigns-roles-over-dealings?module=inline&pgtype=article,https://www.csis.org/analysis/countering-chinas-influence-operations-lessons-australia,https://www.csis.org/analysis/countering-chinas-influence-operations-lessons-australia,https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/2185148/chinese-billionaire-huang-xiangmo-stripped-australian,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/canberra-strands-beijing-s-man-offshore-denies-passport-20190205-p50vtg.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-china/chinese-businessman-denies-reported-justification-for-australian-visa-cancelation-idUSKCN1PX0BY,http://www.afr.com/politics/banned-billionaire-huang-xiangmo-to-liberal-and-labor-i-want-my-money-back-20190208-h1b0e0,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/china-born-billionaire-denies-australian-election-interference,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/who-is-chau-chak-wing-the-alleged-puppeteer-behind-foreign-interference-plot-20220215-p59wjt.html,http://www.smh.com.au/national/behind-the-mysterious-dr-chau-20090703-d7si.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/australia/china-political-influence-campaign-finance.html?_r=0,http://www.afr.com/world/asia/xi-jinping-meets-australian-political-donor-chau-chak-wing-20191204-p53gto,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/australia/china-political-influence-campaign-finance.html?_r=0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-politics-foreign/australia-citing-concerns-over-china-cracks-down-on-foreign-political-influence-idUSKBN1DZ0CN,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/foreign-donation-ban-law-clears-parliament/2ae1a3bd-a89d-49e1-b78b-03823d70223f,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/australia/australia-security-laws-foreign-interference.html,https://apnews.com/article/australia-business-government-and-politics-77b1bfb119d0f5942152950ec95fb012,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/world/australia/australia-foreign-interference-law.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/australia/australia-security-laws-foreign-interference.html;History Contradicts China's Denial of Meddling in Australian Politics;;;;;;
109;;;;False;Margarita Simonyan;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-margarita-simonyan-concentration-camps/6743277.html;RT Chief Spouts Ukraine Disinfo, Extermination Camp Lie;2022-02-15;polygraph;;"On February 13, RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan appeared on the “Evening With Vladimir Solovyov” political talk show to deflect allegations that Russia plans a large-scale invasion of Ukraine.Simonyan argued that it is incorrect to ask whether Russia will invade Ukraine:“I am absolutely convinced that Russia is not going to start a war with Ukraine, and this will not happen in any way. And if Russia is compelled to interfere with what’s happening in Ukraine, [it will only be] with the goal of ending the war in Ukraine, not to start a war in Ukraine.”Simonyan claimed that Ukraine has been waging a war against its own people for eight years, killing thousands of civilians. Thousands of children who had “their arms and legs torn off” were “buried in small coffins,” she said.She used inflammatory language to argue for a humanitarian intervention:“Russia cannot but stop this war. What are we waiting for? For when camps are organized there? For when they are gassing their own people?”Simonyan’s comments came after Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, warned a Russian invasion could be imminent.The United States has begun evacuating embassy staff, while some airlines are halting flights to Ukraine, or diverting them to other destinations.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the invasion would happen on February 16, only to walk that statement back.Simonyan’s remarks are misleading or false.In fact, Russia has already invaded Ukraine – in 2014. The question today is whether the 130,000 troops positioned near Ukraine’s borders are poised to further invade.Pro-Russia militants fire from a residential building at Ukrainian border guards defending the Federal Border Headquarters in Luhansk on June 2, 2014.Russia has long tried to paint the conflict it initiated in the Eastern Donbas region as a civil war. But Russia instigated the conflict there and perpetuates it.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 26, 2014, when Russia-backed forces established a military checkpoint in Crimea on the road from the port city of Sevastopol to Crimea’s capital Simferopol.The following day, Russian special forces, operating without national insignia, seized the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol and raised the Russian flag. The incursion by the so-called “little green men” resulted in Russian forces taking control of the peninsula.Despite initial denials, Russian President Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russian forces invaded the peninsula, saying “our troops stood behind Crimea’s self-defense forces.”Russia attempted to justify its illegal annexation of Crimea with the false claim that the peninsula’s population “was threatened with extermination and voted for reunion with Russia.”Russia has never presented evidence Crimeans were faced with extermination following the February 2014 revolution, which saw then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych flee the country.While protests for and against the so-called Maidan revolution were held in Crimea, there are no reports of state-sponsored violence or repression at that time, let alone proof of ""extermination.""By contrast, following Russia's annexation of Crimea, members of the largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking indigenous Tatar ethnic group have reportedly faced abuse, discrimination and suppression.People write wishes on a large Crimean Tatar flag outside the parliament building in Kyiv on June 15, 2021.Russia denies it deployed troops to eastern Ukraine to back pro-Russian separatists, some of whom were linked to Russian intelligence. Armed conflict broke out there in April 2014.The evidence says otherwise.As Polygraph.info previously reported, in November 2021, a court in Russia's Rostov oblast, near the occupied part of Donbas, issued a verdict in a bribery case.It found that V.N. Zabaluev, who managed a firm which supplied food to Russian troops deployed in the “Donetsk People's Republic"" (DNR) and “Luhansk People's Republic” (LNR), Russia's two puppet states in Donbas, had paid bribes to military officers.Russian soldiers have posted photographs on social media admitting they were operating inside Ukraine, attacking Ukraine and transporting weapons to Ukraine.Other evidence showing that Russian forces have been operating in Ukraine includes video interviews with Russian troops captured inside Ukraine, memorial notices on social media of Russian soldiers who died in Ukraine, an unexplained increase in wounded and dead Russian troops, and the provision of death and disability benefits to Russian soldiers and their families.The so-called “separatist” forces in eastern Ukraine have Russian-made weapons and equipment that were never exported to Ukraine or used by Ukraine’s armed forces.A three-year study by the U.K.-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research found “that factories based in what is today the Russian Federation produced most of the militias’ ammunition and nearly all their weapons, from assault rifles and precision rifles, grenade launchers, precision-guided munitions, and landmines to anti-tank guided weapons.”The “pro-Russian fighters” in eastern Ukraine are using arms and sophisticated weapons systems that were not purchased by Ukraine’s military and therefore could not have been looted. The weapons systems include modern battle tanks with trained crews.An international investigation team found that a Buk-TELAR missile system, brought into Ukraine from Kursk, Russia, by the Russian army’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, was used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. That attack killed all 298 people on board.Igor Girkin, a.k.a. Strelkov, formally a senior commander of Russia’s forces in Donbas in 2014, is one of four individuals on trial in absentia at the Hague District Court for his alleged role in shooting down MH17.The day MH-17 was shot down, a social media account associated with Girkin bragged about downing a Ukrainian military An-26 cargo plane in the vicinity of MH17’s crash site.As Polygraph.info has reported, the post was taken down after it became clear that a passenger airliner, MH17, had been shot down, not a Ukrainian cargo plane. However, Russia’s TASS news agency still has a story online reporting that pro-Russian forces “brought down” an An-26 on the outskirts of the town of Torez, close to where MH17 was shot down.On July 14, 2014, Ukrainian officials said an An-26 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine. But there is no record of an An-26 being shot down on July 17.Debris of the Boeing 777, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.Girkin has claimed that the hostilities in eastern Ukraine would have fizzled out had his unit not invaded.Girkin, who was also a leading “self-defense” commander in Crimea, admitted in a 2015 interview that Crimean parliament members were forced at gunpoint to support Russia’s annexation of the peninsula.Meantime, Simonyan’s reference to murdered children and the potential of a Holocaust-like scenario playing out are staples of Russian propaganda. In July 2014, Russian state media ran the false story that Ukrainian soldiers had tortured and crucified a 3-year-old boy in Slovyansk, Ukraine.In April 2021, Russian media falsely claimed that a Ukrainian drone had killed a child in Oleksandrivsk, a small city in Luhansk, Ukraine.Russian state media have systematically portrayed Ukraine’s government as a “fascist junta” and regularly play up fears of a Nazi threat in Ukraine.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently called statements by his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, propaganda from “the school of Goebbels” that “maybe even surpasses the art of the chief propagandist of the Third Reich.”In a piece published in 2016 by the Washington D.C.-based Center for European Policy Analysis, Edward Lucas and Peter Pomeranzev wrote that Kremlin propagandists “exploit the legacy of World War II” and Russia’s historical trauma to spread the false idea that “everyone who opposes Russia now is a fascist.”";https://www.npr.org/2022/02/11/1080164367/russia-ukraine-invasion-olympics-sullivan,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-states-europe-russia-kyiv-ff41abf90650aa5f456cbb6aafa4c5b3,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/flights-ukraine-halted-redirected-crisis-brews-82859992,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2022/02/14/ukraine-russia-invasion-vladimir-putin/8791644839379/,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ukraines-leader-asks-evidence-invasion-warnings-82863566,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tension-in-crimea-as-pro-russia-and-pro-ukraine-groups-stage-competing-rallies/article17110382/#dashboard/follows/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-annexation-crimea/31129974.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-putin-crimea/putin-admits-russian-forces-were-deployed-to-crimea-idUSL6N0N921H20140417,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-crimea-was-not-threatened-with-extermination-by-nationalists/31683608.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-denounces-persecution-crimean-tatars/31261794.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-kremlin-dodges-as-court-doc-points-to-russians-in-eastern-ukraine/31614603.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/16/fraud-conviction-appears-to-reveal-russian-troop-deployment-in-east-ukraine-a75835,https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-soldiers-social-ukraine-2014-7,https://news.yahoo.com/many-russian-soldiers-died-ukraine-120000328.html,https://www.conflictarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Weapons-of-the-war-in-Ukraine-low.pdf,https://www.politie.nl/en/news/2021/september/2/mh17---investigation-requests-russian-military-to-share-information.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/suspects-dutch-trial-fully-responsible-mh17-downing-prosecution-says-2021-12-21/,https://tass.com/world/741164,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28299334,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/11/21/russias-igor-strelkov-i-am-responsible-for-war-in-eastern-ukraine-a41598,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/08/russian-media-fabricated-story-about-a-child-getting-killed-by-ukrainian-shelling-the-bbc-says/,https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-a-child-died-in-donbas-as-a-result-of-a-ukrainian-drone-attack/,https://www.rt.com/search?q=ukraine+nazis&type=,https://www.rt.com/russia/548933-moscow-slams-ukrainian-minister/,https://cepa.ecms.pl/files/?id_plik=2773;RT Chief Spouts Ukraine Disinfo, Extermination Camp Lie;;;;;;
110;;;;False;Qin Gang;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-internet-censorship-great-firewall/6743266.html;China’s Top U.S. Diplomat Calls Fierce Internet Censorship a ‘Misunderstanding’;2022-02-03;polygraph;;"On January 27, Qin Gang, China’s ambassador to the United States, spoke with National Public Radio’s Steve Inskeep.Qin discussed issues ranging from the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing to a potential military conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan.Qin said Chinese people broadly support the government, and he cited annual surveys from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University as evidence.But Inskeep asked him why China’s government, if so popular, uses repressive measures, including “widespread facial recognition software, internet censorship and other means to limit speech and effectively control the people.”Qin disputed Inskeep’s depiction, focusing on internet freedom in China.“That’s a misunderstanding,” he said. “Actually, Chinese people can have wide access to information on the internet. There are over one billion netizens in China, the world’s largest number of internet users. Every day people can get access to different resources of information. And they can comment and they can exchange.”Inskeep suggested that while Chinese people continue to have access to an enormous amount of information, controversial topics and criticism of the government are scrubbed from the internet.Qin said it is “not true” that criticism of the government does not last long online, adding that “the government has many channels to solicit opinions from the people, including criticism.”However, it is false to say China’s highly curated internet does not drastically limit access to information or severely limit public criticism of the government.China's President Xi Jinping is shown on a screen through digitally decorated glass during the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, on November 23, 2020. (Aly Song/Reuters)In fact, the Chinese government enforces some of the world’s most restrictive controls. It blocks off large portions of the internet to “ensure state security and social harmony.”China maintains that control through a strict legal and regulatory environment and internet filters that allow sweeping manipulation of online discourse.In its 2021 Freedom of the Net report, the nonprofit advocacy group Freedom House called China “the world’s worst abuser of internet freedom for the seventh consecutive year.”Dozens of Chinese government bodies, in concert with internet service providers and an army of online censors, help police the country’s online space.The government has been developing its regime of internet controls for decades.The U.K.-based policy institute Chatham House wrote that even before President Xi Jinping took the helm of the Chinese Communist Party in late 2012, China was “already home to one of the world’s most sophisticated and restrictive systems of internet control.”Customers use computers at an internet cafe in Hefei on July 1, 2009. Jianan Yu/Reuters)In 1997, China’s Ministry of Public Security issued comprehensive regulations on internet security, protection and management.The ministry banned a broadly defined, and at times vague, range of activities online. These included using the internet to make false statements, distort the truth, spread rumors, destroy the order of society, injure the reputation of state organs or incite the overthrow of the government or socialist system.As early as 2002, researchers at Harvard University found that China was blocking thousands of websites “offering information about news, health, education, and entertainment.”At that time, 40 of the top 100 Google searches for ""democracy china” were blocked. The methods and mechanisms of control have evolved since then.In 2008, after more than a decade in the making, China implemented the Golden Shield project. The Hong Kong Free Press described Golden Shield as “a national filter that blocks politically sensitive content from entering the domestic network.”Golden Shield is often referred to as “the Great Firewall of China,” partially because of its “content-filtering firewalls.” Freedom House called China’s “Great Firewall” the “world’s most sophisticated internet censorship apparatus.”According to Freedom House, Chinese authorities, by broadly blocking social media platforms and posts that can in any way be viewed as undermining China’s one-party system, ensure that users only have access to “a highly censored, monitored, and manipulated version of the internet.”Facebook, Twitter, Google, Wikipedia and YouTube are among the thousands of websites that are blocked in China.In 2008, unprecedented protests took place in China on the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan Uprising, and the Summer Olympics were held in Beijing. The following year, massive riots broke out in Xinjiang.Those events precipitated harsher internet controls. For example, China blocked YouTube repeatedly in 2008 and 2009 after videos of the unrest in Tibet were uploaded to the platform.The controls tightened once Xi Jinping came to power.An internal Chinese Communist Party directive first circulated in July 2012 warned that “freedom of the press” was being used as a pretext to undermine the “principle that the media should be infused with the spirit of the party.”That document said subordination of media to “party discipline” was being undermined through promotion of “the free flow of information on the internet” and “slandering our country’s efforts to improve internet management by calling them a crackdown on the internet.”A decorative plate featuring an image of Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen behind a statue of late communist leader Mao Zedong at a souvenir store next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing on February 27, 2018. (Greg Baker (AFP)The New York Times reported in 2013 that the document “bears the unmistakable imprimatur of Xi Jinping.”Yaqui Wang, Human Rights Watch’s senior China researcher, noted the document “set the tone” for “a period of unrelenting crackdowns on the internet, media, civil society and education.”“Gradually, the experience of being online in China changed,"" Wang wrote. ""The list of banned words and images grew. Articles and posts that managed to be published got removed quickly. The government got savvier, and more aggressive, about using its own technology: AI-powered censors could scan images to determine whether they contained certain sensitive words or phrases. An increasing number of foreign websites were blocked by the Great Firewall.”In 2013, tough measures were launched to stop the spread the spread of online rumors.The space for expression online continues to shrink.In 2018, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered the deletion of thousands of “self-media” and social media accounts to stop the spread of “politically harmful information” or “vulgar” content, the Washington D.C.-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders reported.The CAC said 110,000 accounts and 486,000 posts had been removed by December 2018.Official media, already operating under rigid state directives, have also seen greater restrictions.In January 2021, Chinese officials said they would vet the social media posts of journalists while renewing their press credentials.In August 2021, Foreign Policy’s Tracy Wen Liu reported that increasingly large numbers of people are being censored online, in part, because “the censorship machinery” runs on a quota system.Liu argued that people are “too afraid to post meaningfully threatening or dissident content,” leading the censors to “brand milder content as unacceptable to meet their own quotas.”This has included an online crackdown on the LGBT community.Liu and Human Rights Watch’s Yaqui Wang have both documented how aggressive nationalists are further able to dictate online discourse. Wang specifically links this rise in online nationalism to the internet ecosystem created under the Great Firewall.Ambassador Qin claimed there are many channels for criticism of the government. But in practice, serious criticism of government policy, and even mild mockery, are banned. In March 2020, former real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang went missing after writing an essay critical of the CCP’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The essay alluded to Xi, but did not mention him by name.Ren was later sentenced to 18 years in prison on corruption, bribery and embezzlement charges that he did not contest.In May 2020, Chen Jieren, a former state media journalist turned anti-corruption blogger, was jailed for 15 years for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” “extortion and blackmail,” “illegal business activity” and “bribes.”In truth, Chinese Human Rights Defenders said, Chen was jailed for exercising his freedom of expression. They argued the harsh sentence was intended to send a “chilling signal to online independent commentators and citizen journalists.”Even the censors are not safe.In 2021, Peng Bo, former deputy chief of the Chinese cybersace agency, was expelled from the CCP and charged with corruption after investigators found he had “strayed from the decisions and plans laid down by the Party Central about the propaganda struggle over the internet.”Poking fun at Xi is also not permitted.After Xi was mocked for using the contrived phrase “sprinkling pepper” in a February 2021 speech, the word pepper “was completely censored on Weibo for eight days after the speech,” China Digital Times reports.Likewise, Chinese authorities added Winnie the Pooh to an internet blacklist after netizens compared Xi’s physical appearance to that of the cartoon bear.The political risk news and analysis site Global Risks Insights said “Beijing sees a serious effort to undermine the dignity of the presidential office and Xi himself” in the comparison.But Global Risks Insights also noted China has lost the opportunity to seize on a potentially “positive, and organic, public image campaign for Xi,” thus highlighting the touchiness of authoritarian regimes.Meantime, Beijing also manipulates online discourse using an army of fake commentators.A 2016 Harvard University study found that the Chinese government “fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year.”The researchers found that online commentators, rather than engaging critics of the Chinese government, are carrying out a campaign of “strategic distraction from collective action, grievances or general negativity.”";https://ash.harvard.edu/publications/understanding-ccp-resilience-surveying-chinese-public-opinion-through-time?admin_panel=1,https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf,https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2021,https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/03/restrictions-online-freedom-expression-china/chinas-domestic-restrictions-online-freedom,http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/information-technology/computer-information-network-and-internet-security-protection-and-management-regulations-1997.html,https://cyber.harvard.edu/filtering/china/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338361425_The_Golden_Shield_Project_of_China_A_Decade_Later-An_in-Depth_Study_of_the_Great_Firewall,https://hongkongfp.com/2017/09/03/evolution-chinas-great-firewall-21-years-censorship/,https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/FreedomOfInformationChina/the-great-firewall-of-china-background/index.html,https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2021,http://access.opennet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/accesscontested-china.pdf,https://www.networkworld.com/article/2284523/google-news--youtube-blocked-in-china-amid-tibet-riots.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/25/china-blocks-youtube,https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html?mcubz=1,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/01/china-great-firewall-changing-generation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-rumours,https://www.nchrd.org/2019/02/2018-hrd-report/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/vetting-01212021130510.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/08/08/china-online-censorship-snitches/,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-wechat-deletes-university-lgbt-accounts-2021-07-07/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54245327,https://www.nchrd.org/2020/04/china-release-journalist-chen-jieren-imprisoned-for-15-years-for-criticising-ccp/,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/top-chinese-internet-censor-lost-133844709.html,https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2022/01/sensitive-words-top-10-censored-terms-of-2021/,https://globalriskinsights.com/2016/03/china-blacklists-winnie-pooh/,https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/50c.pdf?m=1464790150;China’s Top U.S. Diplomat Calls Fierce Internet Censorship a ‘Misunderstanding’;;;;;;
111;;;;Misleading;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-nato-open-door/6743265.html;Putin’s Misleading Hairsplitting About Who Can Join NATO;2022-02-02;polygraph;;"On February 1, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Hungary’s Prime Minister Victor Orban in the Kremlin. During a joint news conference, Putin commented on Russia’s standoff with the West over his military buildup along Ukraine’s borders.Putin criticized the U.S. written response to Russian security demands concerning Ukraine and NATO expansion. The U.S. has said membership in the 30-member U.S.-European military alliance will remain open to Ukraine, in accordance with NATO’s founding principles.Putin claimed that, since NATO can reject countries that seek membership, there is no “open-door” policy:“They say the policy of ‘open doors.’ Where did it come from? NATO has an ‘open doors’ policy? Where is it prescribed? Nowhere.”That is misleading.In fact, the open-door policy is written in NATO’s founding document – The North Atlantic Treaty – signed in Washington, D.C., in 1949. Article 10 of the treaty states:""The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of America. The Government of the United States of America will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.""Putin’s argument seems to echoe an op-ed published by The Hill newspaper on January 27, headlined “There is no NATO open door policy.” The authors, Michael O’Hanlon, the Philip H Knight Chair in Defense and Strategy at the Brookings Institution, and Stephen Van Evera, a professor of political science with MIT’s Security Studies Program, argued that the “open-door policy” does not mean that any country has an “automatic right” to join the alliance.“While Russia should not be allowed to veto Ukraine’s hypothetical membership in NATO, there is, in fact, no NATO open-door policy — at least not on the unconditional terms that are often implied when that concept is invoked,” they wrote. That’s a far cry, however, from saying newcomers aren't welcome.O’Hanlon and Van Evera argued that Article 10 is conditional: “New members can join NATO only if their membership would enhance regional security.”They added: “It is difficult to see how adding Ukraine to NATO could enhance the region’s security. More likely, it would further antagonize Russia and increase, rather than reduce, the risks of some type of conflict.” The authors are known for their long-term skepticism about NATO. In his 2017 book, “Beyond NATO: A New Security Architecture for Eastern Europe,” O’Hanlon pushed the idea of a new “neutrality-based” security architecture in Europe that would allow lifting sanctions from Russia in exchange for its promise to withdraw military forces from Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.In his February 1 comments, Putin also repeated the thoroughly debunked claims that the U.S. has “ditched” Russia by breaking a promise to never expand NATO eastward, and that the alliance has “encircled” his country.As Polygraph.info and others have documented, no promise was ever made to Russia not to expand NATO eastward. In addition, NATO member states share less than 80 miles of Russia’s 2,577-mile-long border.Orban’s visit to Moscow was part of a flurry of high-level diplomatic meetings involving the U.S., Russian and EU officials. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops and heavy weaponry around Ukraine. Russia denies it plans to invade, but it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has backed a war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region that has killed 14,000.Among other things, Russia demands that Ukraine be permanently banned from NATO membership, and that NATO forces withdraw from Romania and Bulgaria and return to positions in 1991 before the Soviet Union crumbled.The United States has called these demands “non-starters.” Instead, in written responses to the Kremlin leaked and published by Spain’s El Pais newspaper on February 2, the U.S. offered Russia negotiations on disarmament agreements and trust-building measures – “the success of which are conditioned on the start of a de-escalation of the Russian military threat to Ukraine.”El Pais reported:“The Russian authorities demanded a written response to their proposal to sign a deal that gave security guarantees to Moscow regarding the expansion of NATO to the east. Moscow even included a draft version of the hypothetical deal. The response was two texts: one titled “Confidential/Rel Russia” (consisting of an introduction, seven points and some brief conclusions) on the part of Washington; and another, under the heading “NATO-Russia Restricted” (with 12 sections), from the Atlantic Alliance.“From the beginning, the document from Washington makes clear that it “continues to firmly support NATO’s Open Door Policy,” and so does not exclude the future incorporation of Ukraine or Georgia into the Alliance. And it clarifies that whatever the case this issue should be dealt with at the NATO-Russia Council (NRC). The NATO text also reinforces its open-door policy and underlines the right of all states to choose their agreements in terms of security “free from outside interference.”Pentagon spokesman John Kirby confirmed at a press briefing that the documents published by El Pais were authentic. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has approved sending some 3,000 American troops to eastern Europe in addition to the 8,500 that the Pentagon already put on alert for potential deployment, Kirby said.";https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-vladimir-putin-hungary-russia-kremlin-meeting/,https://tass.ru/politika/13587295,https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/591448-there-is-no-nato-open-door-policy,https://www.cornell.edu/video/stephen-van-evera-american-grand-strategy-crises-ukraine-middle-east,https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-NATO-Security-Architecture-Marshall/dp/0815732570,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-to-justify-ukraine-threat-russia-touts-phony-nato-promise-tale/31651336.html,https://twitter.com/NATOpress/status/1479012494505127937?s=20&t=AMXszGh1mAHehn8RlPJySg,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-secretary-of-state-blinken-gives-remarks-on-rising-tension-between-ukraine-russia,https://english.elpais.com/usa/2022-02-02/us-offers-disarmament-measures-to-russia-in-exchange-for-a-deescalation-of-military-threat-in-ukraine.html,https://english.elpais.com/usa/2022-02-02/nato-will-deploy-more-troops-in-the-east-if-moscow-continues-its-military-escalation.html,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-03/ukraine-russia-crisis-us-troops-nato-allies-eastern-europe/100800480;Putin’s Misleading Hairsplitting About Who Can Join NATO;;;;;;

Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan revolution was neither “radical nationalist” nor a “coup.” Polygraph.info and others have fact-checked similar claims more than once. But the new, more egregious claim is that the “population of Crimea” was “threatened with extermination,” and thus voted to “reunify with Russia.” In fact, no one in Crimea faced the threat of extermination after former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country for Russia.Crimea’s annexation began with Russian forces in unmarked uniforms seizing the Black Sea peninsula’s parliament building in Simferopol. After securing the building, the Russian forces brought in loyal members of the local parliament and blocked dissenters from entering. Thus began the “referendum” process. The subsequent voting, speedily organized in roughly 10 days, was not held in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution, which requires referenda to include the whole country.As for the claim that the “population of Crimea” voted overwhelmingly in favor of “reunifying” with Russia, the referendum was not monitored by any qualified independent organization like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.The OSCE declined to send a monitoring mission after its military observers in the area reported that Russian troops had fired on them.Russia claimed, with no independently verification, that 96 percent of the referendum’s voters supported annexation to Russia. But leaked information from the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council suggests only about 30 percent of Crimea’s population turned out to vote, and that slightly more than half voted to annex. Of course, the ballot was rigged: Voters were offered a choice of joining Russia or remaining independent under Crimea’s 1992 constitution – not remaining part of Ukraine. On March 27, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the Crimean referendum invalid.Russia’s annexation violated several international agreements Russia had signed, including bilateral treaties with Ukraine and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. In signing the latter, Russia, Britain, the United States and Ukraine agreed to respect Ukraine’s 1991 borders in exchange for Ukraine giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons.In addition to U.N. and EU condemnation, the International Criminal Court has ruled that Russia’s presence in the Crimea is an occupation.;https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-distorts-history-of-maidan-revolution-in-ukraine/29617691.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/crimean-parliament-seized-by-unknown-pro-russian-gunmen,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/17/crimea-six-years-after-illegal-annexation/,https://www.cfr.org/interview/why-crimean-referendum-illegitimate,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-factcheck-russia-spins-pseudo-history-on-anniversary-of-crimea-seizure/31158197.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-annexation-crimea/31129974.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-factcheck-russia-spins-pseudo-history-on-anniversary-of-crimea-seizure/31158197.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-crimea-land-grab/29496991.html,https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-icc-concludes-its-preliminary-examination-in-crimea-and-donbas-whats-next-for-the-situation-in-ukraine/;Crimea Was Not Threatened With ‘Extermination’, as Russian Disinfo Claims;;;;;;

The series documents Syrian children collecting scrap metal for sale in Idlib, the last rebel-held province in the war-torn country.Zhao deleted his tweet after Suleiman called him out. However, the images Zhao posted had been retweeted among his 1.1 million followers on Twitter and widely shared on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying, who is Zhao’s fellow spokesperson for the ministry, posted the same tweet and later deleted it.Suleiman told Radio Free Asia (RFA), the Voice of America’s (VOA) sister organization, that the Chinese officials neither issued a correction for the misrepresentation nor apologized for using his photos without permission.“I’m so angry because what the officials are doing is changing the truth,” Suleiman said in a written statement to RFA. “It’s so annoying when you see officials in countries trying to change the facts.”This is not the first time officials from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs misused pictures to criticize the West’s military involvement in Afghanistan.Last November, Zhao posted on Twitter a graphic, computer-generated illustration depicting a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child. The tweet was in reference to an Australian inquiry into alleged war crimes by its soldiers in Afghanistan.Australian lawmakers and Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded China delete the image and formally apologize. Neither demand was met. Twitter also refused Morrison’s request to remove the doctored photo.Suleiman’s photos reflected the dire consequences of the Syrian civil war, which has dragged out for more than a decade.The United Nations identified 350,209 civilian casualties from the war between March 2011, when the conflict erupted, and March 2021. The U.N. said the tally indicated “a minimum verifiable number and is certainly an undercount of the actual number of killings.”A child stands in the middle of ruins of an ancient building in the archaeological site of Sarjableh, in the northern countryside of Idlib, Syria, November 17, 2021. (Khalil Ashawi/REUTERS))The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated in June 2021 that the conflict had claimed 494,438 lives since 2011, Agence France-Presse reported.The war created the world’s biggest refugee crisis, with the U.N. refugee agency estimating the number of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers at 6.8 million.What began in 2011 as popular and peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, calling for reform and an end to its corruption, quickly escalated into a brutal civil and proxy war between Assad’s government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, and anti-government rebel groups, backed by the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kurds.Syrian civilians, many of them women and children, have been victims of brutality. While all parties to the conflict, the U.S.-led coalition included, have been accused of human rights violations and war crimes, the Assad regime has by far perpetrated most of the violence against civilians, The New York Times reported.The Assad regime has been accused of repeatedly using chemical weapons, including the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013, the 2017 chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun, a town in southern rebel-held Idlib province, and the Douma chemical attack in 2018.Syrian government forces have also used conventional weapons, aerial bombardment, siege, starvation and expulsion against civilians.“The Chinese government is participating in the ongoing massacre against the Syrian people through its use of its veto in the Security Council against decisions aimed at deterring the Syrian regime from killing the people and even against decisions to pass humanitarian aid to Syrians across the border,” Suleiman told RFA.China, however, has kept a relatively low profile compared to the main parties directly involved in military action. China has used its veto power in the U.N. Security Council numerous times in alignment with Russia to side with the Assad regime.United Nations Security Council vote on a humanitarian draft resolution for Syria, which fail to gain the support of Russia and China, at U.N. headquarters in New York, September 19, 2019.

The remaining Security Council members all voted in favor of the resolutions.The United Nations said humanitarian aid delivered from Turkey was a “lifeline” for millions of Syrian civilians in the country’s northwest.China has provided humanitarian aid to Syria through bilateral and multilateral channels. It has also participated in conflict mediation efforts on Syria by attending peace talks like the Geneva I and Geneva II peace conferences, the Vienna peace talks, and by welcoming the Astana Peace Process initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (C), Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (R) and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attend a meeting on Syria in Astana on March 16, 2018. (Alexey Filippov/AFP)In vetoing multiple U.N. resolutions on Syria, China claimed it based those decisions on its longstanding declared policy of respecting state sovereignty and not interfering in the internal affairs of other nations.China’s Syria policy has been driven mainly by its security and economic objectives in the region, according to Giorgio Cafiero, CEO and founder of Gulf State Analytics, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Washington, D.C.“Beijing wants to build a strong partnership with Damascus to maintain friendly ties and cooperate on counter-terrorism issues,” Cafiero wrote. “Second, economically, the Chinese leadership seeks a Sino-Syrian relationship that helps Beijing advance its vision for the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).”The BRI is China’s plan to build a network of infrastructure projects across Asia and Africa, fostering economic ties and enhancing its trade prospects.;https://meimages.com/news/unicef-photo-of-the-year-award-2021/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/syria-photographer-01302022110944.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/syria-photographer-01302022110944.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_australia-clashes-china-over-fake-war-crimes-post/6198974.html,https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27539&LangID=E,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210601-decade-of-syria-war-killed-nearly-500-000-people-new-tally,https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/,https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/magazine/germany-trial-syria.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-1500-killed-in-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack-us-says/2013/08/30/b2864662-1196-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43697084,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/syria-photographer-01302022110944.html,https://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10403.doc.htm,https://www.france24.com/en/20120204-russia-china-veto-un-draft-resolution-syrian-unrest-assad-regime-change-arab-league,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/07/19/157036969/china-and-russia-veto-un-resolution-threatening-sanctions-on-syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-un-icc/russia-china-veto-u-n-bid-to-refer-syria-to-international-court-idUSBREA4M03220140523,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-un/u-n-nations-condemn-syria-russia-china-seen-isolated-idUKBRE8720ZN20120803,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-un/russia-china-veto-syria-aid-via-turkey-for-second-time-this-week-idUSKBN24B2NW,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2020-07-11/note-correspondents-response-questions-syria,https://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10403.doc.htm,https://www.mei.edu/publications/china-and-syria-war-and-reconstruction;To Bash U.S., China Misrepresents Photos from Syria as Afghanistan;;;;;;
114;;;;False;Vasily Nebenzya;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-ukraine-un/6743261.html;Under Glare of U.N., Russia Casts Doubt on Forces Outside Ukraine;2022-02-01;polygraph;;"On January 31, the United Nations Security Council held a special meeting on the situation in Ukraine requested by the United States. Russia objected to proceeding with the meeting but lost a vote to stop it. (China voted with Russia.)The U.S. and its allies warned the U.N. that Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine posed a risk to peace and security. “The situation we are facing in Europe is urgent and dangerous. Russia’s actions strike at the very heart of the U.N. charter,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield said in her opening remarks.Russia’s U.N. representative, Vasily Nebenzya, responded with denials, deriding the Security Council meeting as “megaphone diplomacy,” Russia’s state-owned broadcaster RT reported.“Their (Western colleagues’ - RT) task is to prevent the natural, fraternal coexistence of our two countries [Russia and Ukraine] and peoples, which would destroy plans to weaken Russia and form an arc of instability around her,” Nebenzya said, apparently to NATO.Russia is insisting that Ukraine be banned from NATO membership and citing security concerns to justify the buildup. Nebenzya left the meeting right before his Ukrainian counterpart took the microphone, RT reported.In fact, nobody but Russia has been preventing “natural, fraternal coexistence” with its neighbors. Russia’s military aggression caused its alienation from Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.Nebenzya also cast doubt on the size of the military buildup near Ukrainian borders:“Where did the figure of 100,000 troops, who are located, as you claim, on the Russian-Ukrainian border, come from? Although this is not the case – we have not mentioned or confirmed this figure anywhere.”That is false. Of course, there isn’t an exact count, but satellite images document the buildup and Russia hasn't denied the troop movements.The satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies first reported a significant increase of Russian troops and military equipment near Russia’s border with Ukraine back in November 2021. Images released by Maxar and shared by the news agencies showed an estimated 90,000 troops and military equipment near the city of Elnya, 250 km from Ukraine.The buildup continued despite an offer by the United States and its European allies to negotiate de-escalation with the Kremlin. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, warning of unprecedented sanctions should Russia forces cross into Ukraine.Russia argues that it is being encircled by NATO’s gradual expansion. The Kremlin produced a set of security demands, including the withdrawal of NATO troops from Bulgaria and Romania, both of which are NATO member states. The U.S. and NATO have called withdrawals and the ban on Ukraine NATO membership non-starters.The Kremlin and Russian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly denied plans to invade. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it was conducting drills in southwestern Russia to test combat readiness.Then, on January 29, Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that troops in the “Western Military District,” which directly borders Ukraine, would return to their permanent bases. The ministry said that “the advance parties of chemical, biological and nuclear defense units,” along with military aviation and tank brigades, had completed their exercises.Military experts, including Michael Kofman, senior fellow at the Center for New American Security (CNAS), urged caution.“It is not a positive indicator; quite the opposite. They're completing scheduled checks & training exercises, getting personnel to a higher level of readiness. There is no pullback of forward deployed units,” Kofman tweeted.A new set of images released by Maxar on January 20 showed even more Russia troops and equipment in border areas, with the closest locations mapped as eight miles from Klimovo and about 18 miles from Klintsy (both Russian towns).On January 25, the Russian investigative group Cite Intelligence Team said it had gathered evidence that Russia was relocating an elite airborne paratrooper unit to the Ukrainian border.On January 28, Reuters, citing U.S. officials, reported that Russia’s buildup included blood supplies for potential casualties.The White House said the U.S. would consider sending additional troops to assist NATO allies in Europe, as well as increase military aid to help Kyiv defend the country should Russia invade.In addition, a senior White House official said on January 31 that Washington is ready to respond with a new round of sanctions that would target people “in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision-making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin’s destabilizing behavior.” Also on January 31, Putin ordered Russia’s social services agencies to pay benefits and pensions to the residents of Ukraine’s Donbas region, including those who do not have proof of Russian citizenship.Simultaneously, the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, discussed legislation calling on Putin to recognize Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent sovereign states. A vote on the bill reportedly is scheduled for February 14.";https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/31/world/ukraine-russia-us#ukraine-security-council,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/security-council-adjourns-action-us-russia-spar-ukraine/story?id=82581233,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-un-security-council-meets-to-discuss-tensions-between-u-s-russia-and-ukraine,https://russian.rt.com/world/news/955622-zapad-bratskoe-sosuschestvovanie,https://news.sky.com/story/build-up-of-russian-troops-on-ukraine-russia-border-sparks-concerns-among-western-allies-12466937,https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2021/11/02/maxar-zafiksirovala-sosredotochenie-rossiiskikh-voisk-na-granitse-s-ukrainoi-v-kieve-perebrosku-vooruzhenii-ne-zametili-news,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/joe-biden-warns-russia-will-face-swift-and-severe-consequences-if-ukraine-is-attacked/ar-AATkJNv,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-wants-nato-forces-leave-romania-bulgaria-foreign-ministry-2022-01-21/,https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2022/01/11/rossiiskie-voennye-nachali-ucheniia-v-regionakh-granichashchikh-s-ukrainoi-v-nikh-uchastvuiut-okolo-3000-chelovek-news,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/25/01/2022/61efd2989a794781955e811f,https://structure.mil.ru/structure/okruga/west/news.htm,https://structure.mil.ru/structure/okruga/west/news/more.htm?id=12405864@egNews,https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1487809310302380033?s=20&t=ybmB6WW4P0EPaZLxPMZPnw,https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2022/01/20/satellite-images-show-more-russian-troops-equipment-near-ukraine/,https://meduza.io/news/2022/01/25/cit-rossiyskih-desantnikov-nachali-perebrasyvat-k-granitse-s-ukrainoy,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-buildup-ukraine-border-includes-blood-wounded-us-officials-say-2022-01-28/,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-threatens-retaliation-ukraine-demands-113805512.html,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/592078-us-readies-sanctions-on-russian-elites-in-event-of-ukraine-invasion,https://yandex.ru/news/story/MID_Ukrainy_nazval_poruchenie_Putina_osocvyplatakh_vDNR_i_LNR_narusheniem_suvereniteta--1cd8228b56465e927e3c3d6c42823839?lang=ru&wan=1&t=1643670643&persistent_id=178340039,https://ria.ru/20220131/priznanie-1770277567.html;Under Glare of U.N., Russia Casts Doubt on Forces Outside Ukraine;;;;;;
115;;;;Unsubstantiated;Sergei Naryshkin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-beijing-olympics-russia-conspiracy/6743250.html;Russian Security Chief Spins Baseless Olympics Conspiracy Theory;2022-01-20;polygraph;;"On January 18, Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, claimed the United States and some of its allies are planning an “aggressive intervention” to discredit the 2022 Winter Olympics, set to take place in Beijing next month.Naryshkin said his agency had “quite extensive information on the large-scale campaign launched by the United States and its most odious, obedient allies for aggressive and malicious interference in the preparation of the Beijing Olympics.”“We see their attempts to discredit the organizers of the Olympic Games in Beijing. The main role in these actions is played by the U.S. Department of State, which coordinates all the anti-Chinese activity on the subject of the Olympics by the non-governmental organizations and media it controls,"" he said.“Frankly, we do not see anything new in this practice,” Naryshkin added, contending the same methods were used to discredit Russia on the eve of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi.The claim that U.S. State Department, with compliant NGOs and media in tow, is coordinating a campaign to discredit the Winter Games, is unsubstantiated. However, it fits into a long-standing narrative by senior Russian figures, who deny that civil society groups and media act autonomously in open societies.It is true that U.S. government officials last month announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing Beijing’s “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.”While the boycott does not prevent Team USA athletes from competing, Russia criticized it, saying the games should be free of politics.A woman waits on a bus station in front of an advertising board featuring Bing Dwen Dwen, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Mascot and Shuey Rhon Rhon, the 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympic Games Mascot, in Beijing on January 19, 2022. (Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters)Allegations of genocide and other human rights abuses against Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region have exacerbated tensions between Beijing and the West.Western media and rights groups have extensively covered and documented the abuses, prompting sporadic calls to boycott the Olympics.For example, a coalition of over 160 groups, including Tibetan, Uyghur, Southern Mongolian, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, Chinese Democracy and human rights activists, delivered a letter to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president on September 9, 2020, demanding that it “reverse its mistake in awarding Beijing the honor of hosting the Winter Olympic Games in 2022.” However, boycott calls have varied. In October 2020, the Associated Press reported that the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) was among groups that had asked the International Olympic Committee to remove the Winter Olympics from China.Although the AP said the WUC was not then seeking a boycott, Arkin reached out to the Voice of America after publication of this fact check to clarify that the Congress last summer was among the first to call for a diplomatic and a full boycott of the games.China regularly paints the World Uyghur Congress, which receives funding from the U.S. government-funded National Endowment for Democracy, as a terrorist organization and tool of the West. Other groups and activists, some of whom call the 2022 Winter Olympics “the Genocide Games,” are seeking a boycott.Tsela Zoksang, an 18-year-old Tibetan activist, told Teen Vogue: “We postponed the Olympics for a pandemic. I don’t see why we can’t postpone for genocide.”She added that “genocide has to be a red line,” citing allegations that Uyghurs and others, possibly numbering in the millions, have been put in “modern-day concentration camps.”The Teen Vogue report challenges the notion that the Olympic Games are “apolitical,” noting that China pressured the International Olympics Committee to only allow Taiwan to compete as “Chinese Taipei.”Amnesty International China researcher Alkan Akad told Polygraph.info the London-based rights group had not taken a stand on the boycott issue.“It's quite rare that Amnesty takes a position or calls for boycotts for sports events. We usually wouldn't call for an event not to be hosted in a country simply because of its poor human rights record,” he said.Still, Amnesty International has stated the Winter Olympic Games provide the world “an opportunity to push for human rights improvements in China.”In comments to Agence France-Presse, Akad warned against letting Beijing use the Winter Olympics as “a sportswashing opportunity,” noting that promises the Chinese government made during the 2008 Games in Beijing to improve human rights “never materialized.”Western media organizations have critically covered the upcoming games on a host of issues, but the coverage has hardly been uniform.Rights groups have also not been uniform in their recommendations. For example, New York-based Human Rights Watch and others have recommended that athletes, for their own safety, not to speak out while in China. Beijing has warned that athletes who violate “Chinese laws and regulations” are “subject to certain punishment.”But Akad has called on the International Olympic Committee and other bodies to “adequately respect athletes’ and sports officials’ wishes to speak out about human rights, including on issues deemed ‘sensitive’ by the authorities.”Thus, a variety of independent entities have been providing their own analyses, reactions and conclusions. That runs counter to how some Russian officials see the world.Senior Russian officials have regularly described the actions of dozens of independent media outlets and civil society groups as coordinated by hostile foreign governments.As the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted in 2017, Russian state media worked to portray Western-funded civil society groups as tools of Western intelligence that seek to “provoke or overthrow the Russian government.”That view is embodied in Russia’s “foreign agent law,” which has underpinned a government crackdown on journalists, news organizations and civil groups critical of the state.Maxim Trudolyubov, a contributing editor to Meduza, a Russian- and English-language online newspaper, told NPR:“The way they perceive civil society is: ‘He who pays the piper, calls the tune’ … They decided for the public that the reason for anything that goes wrong comes from the West, from abroad.”President Vladimir Putin has expressed the belief that U.S. news media, like their Russian counterparts, are controlled from the top down.A giant screen broadcasts news footage of a virtual meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a shopping mall in Beijing on December 15, 2021. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)Asked in a 2005 interview about media freedom in Russia, Putin told CBS television’s “60 Minutes” program: “Haven't we seen resignations of leading American journalists from the national media due to their positions on Iraq?”As noted by CBS, Putin mistakenly believed that Dan Rather had been removed from his position as a CBS anchor over his views on the Iraq War or the 2004 U.S. presidential election.Rather was still working for CBS and “60 Minutes” at the time of the Putin interview, although he had stepped down as anchor following issues that arose over a “60 Minutes II” story concerning former President George W. Bush’s National Guard service record, which cited potentially forged documents.Putin had earlier told Bush he thought the former U.S. president had a hand in getting CBS journalists fired. As Time magazine reported at the time:“But when Bush talked about the Kremlin's crackdown on the media and explained that democracies require a free press, the Russian leader gave a rebuttal that left the President nonplussed. If the press was so free in the U.S., Putin asked, then why had those reporters at CBS lost their jobs? Bush was openmouthed. ‘Putin thought we'd fired Dan Rather,’ says a senior Administration official. ‘It was like something out of 1984.’”The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was closely scrutinized for its exorbitant cost, corruption, rights issues and a state-sponsored doping scandal that led to Russia being banned from international sporting events. The U.S. sent an official delegation to Sochi, although senior figures like then-President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden did not attend. France, Germany and other countries also declined to send senior government leaders to the games. Those absences were linked to Russia’s passage of a so-called “anti-gay bill.”Nonetheless, the United States offered to help Russia provide security for the 2014 Winter Games. Russia largely refused that offer.Clarification: This article has been updated to represent the World Uyghur Congress' current position on a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.";https://www.voanews.com/a/reports-biden-admin-expected-to-announce-diplomatic-boycott-of-2022-beijing-winter-games-/6340954.html,https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-china-united-states-winter-olympics-beijing-2022/,https://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/press-release-activists-remind-the-ioc-of-past-warnings-of-chinas-human-rights-atrocities-ahead-of-the-executive-committee-meeting-in-lausanne/,https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-juan-antonio-samaranch-beijing-2020-tokyo-olympics-china-d03b46950b26420664677b8d1aa8caa2,https://search.globaltimes.cn/QuickSearchCtrl,https://www.ned.org/wp-content/themes/ned/search/grant-search.php?organizationName=&region=Asia&projectCountry=China&amount=&fromDate=&toDate=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&projectFocus%5B%5D=&search=&maxCount=10&orderBy=ReverseSortAs&start=1&sbmt=1,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/beijing-winter-olympics-boycott,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/01/china-world-must-use-winter-olympics-to-demand-human-rights-improvements/,http://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220119-amnesty-warns-over-sportswashing-at-beijing-olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/athletes-warned-speaking-out-china-winter-olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/protesting-winter-olympics-athletes-face-certain-punishment-suggests-beijing-official,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/01/china-world-must-use-winter-olympics-to-demand-human-rights-improvements/,https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/05/18/delegitimization-and-division-in-russia-pub-69958,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/31/1021804569/russias-foreign-agent-law-targets-journalists-activists-even-ordinary-citizens,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-defends-his-democracy-06-05-2005/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy#Accusations_of_bias,http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1032354,00.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/that-sochi-olympic-boondoggle-russians-say-all-the-investment-is-paying-off/2017/11/13/65014bd0-b82c-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/sport-doping-russia-timeline/factbox-timeline-of-the-russia-doping-case-idUSKBN28R2HR,https://sputniknews.com/20130611/Russian-Anti-Gay-Bill-Passes-With-Overwhelming-Majority-181618460.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russia-cooperate-on-sochi-security/1835711.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-efforts-to-assist-sochi-olympics-limited-by-russians/2014/01/24/7c17c6fe-8370-11e3-8099-9181471f7aaf_story.html;Russian Security Chief Spins Baseless Olympics Conspiracy Theory;;;;;;
116;;;;Misleading;Ren TV, Russian TV channel;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-mafia/6743249.html;Presto Chango: Russian Media Elevate Putin from ‘Mafia Boss’ to Genius;2022-01-19;polygraph;;"On January 13, numerous Russian news agencies and media reported that a former top U.S. consultant had called President Vladimir Putin the most brilliant leader on the world stage.The reports were based on an analysis written by geopolitical strategist Harald Malmgren and published January 13 on a U.K. website. Malmgren has served as an adviser to U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford.The title of his post: “What The West Gets Wrong About Putin.”But the Russian media ended up getting Malmgren wrong.Take REN TV, which reported:“Former senior aide to U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Harald Malmgren, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the smartest politician on the world stage.”But that statement is misleading. REN TV not only exaggerated the original quote, it ignored the fact that Malmgren brought up Putin’s intellect while comparing him to an Italian mob boss.Here is what Malmgren wrote:“The impression of Putin that I was left with was of a man who was more intelligent than most of the politicians I had met in Washington and in other capitals around the world. I was reminded of my childhood: I grew up in a predominantly Sicilian neighbourhood, with a mafia maintaining order. No disorganised crime allowed. Putin did seem to have the instincts of a Sicilian mafia boss: quick to reward but quick to pose mortal risk in the event of non-conformity to the family rules.”REN TV is owned by the National Media Group, a $30 billion private corporation led by former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva, with whom Putin reportedly had a romantic relationship and at least one son. (Kabayeva has denied those reports, however.)Apart from REN TV, Russian state media and others reported the story in a similar manner – exaggerating Malmgren’s description of Putin's intellect while ignoring the mafia comparison. Here are examples from TASS, a state news agency; Ria Novosti, also a state news agency; Izvestia, a newspaper owned by Gazprom, the state-controlled natural gas monopoly; and Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a government newspaper.Malgrem’s remembrance of the Russian leader comes as Putin threatens a possible invasion of Ukraine over objections about the expansion of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Putin, 69, has led Russia since 1999. His current term will end in 2024, and although he has been able to stifle political dissent and sideline opponents, his popularity is waning among young Russians.In a survey conducted by the independent Levada Center in September 2021, 57% of the respondents aged 18-24 said they did not want to see Putin as Russia’s president after 2024, 32% said they’d like him to remain in the office and 11% said they found it difficult to answer the question.

Before leaving office last year, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel approved arms deals with Egypt, ruled by Abdel al-Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power in a 2013 military coup in 2013 and whose regime has been criticized for rights abuses and repression. Germany has reportedly sold Egypt three naval frigates, as well as air defense systems.According to the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle, arms deals signed by Merkel at the end of her term set records for revenue, totaling $5.6 billion for 2021.Egypt is not the only authoritarian country to which Germany sold arms. Although it halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia in 2018, it sold to other Gulf States, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar. Those countries, along with Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have played a controversial role in the ongoing civil war in Yemen. To be sure, the U.S. has also faced criticism for arms sales with countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE. In 2021, the Biden administration sought to stop providing “offensive” arms to Saudi Arabia, but cooperation continues. Unlike Germany, however, the U.S. has supplied lethal military aid to Ukraine, most notably the FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile. In addition, since the early days of the Russia-backed war in Ukraine's Donbas region, the U.S. provided defensive and non-lethal aid such as counter-battery radars used to locate enemy artillery, and night-vision devices. (Still, the U.S. reluctance to provide lethal aid early in the conflict has been criticized by Ukrainians and others.)Going back further, Germany has also for years exported arms to Turkey, including Leopard 2 main battle tanks. Both countries are members of the Western NATO alliance, whose expansion Russia dubiously cites as the security threat instigating its troop buildup outside Ukraine. Egypt, the UAE and Turkey have been accused of supporting the warring parties in Libya’s civil war, despite an international arms embargo.In addition to sales, German arms manufacturers also make money from licensing agreements that allow foreign countries to manufacture German weapons. Despite record profits, these sales were largely carried out under the previous government, which was replaced in 2021 by a coalition of the SPD (Social Democrats), the Greens, and the Free Democrats.Late last year, Baerbock announced that legislation was in the works to further limit arms sales to third countries, meaning non-European Union, non-NATO states. It remains to be seen how restrictive the new policy will be if passed. And while the new government voices opposition to the kind of arms deals the Merkel government made, the refusal to provide arms for Ukraine has been consistent since 2014. The same day as Baerbock’s visit, the United Kingdom signaled its position by sending a Royal Air Force C17 cargo plane to Kyiv laden with light anti-tank weapons. The U.K. also announced it would be sending a small contingent of its special forces to help train Ukrainian military personnel.

Under the agreement, China agreed to expand purchases over two years of certain U.S. goods and services by $200 billion.President Donald Trump spoke prior to signing ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade agreement with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, January 15, 2020. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)With the period expiring at the end of 2021, data show that China fell well short.In response to Vilsack, China’s state-run newspaper Global Times published an editorial the next day alleging the “repeated use of the [trade] agreement as a weapon to pressure China.”“In fact, despite the US' reckless trade war that goes against basic economic rules and the trend of globalization and its malicious crackdown, China has strived [SIC] to overcome the difficulties caused by the pandemic and implemented the phase one trade agreement,” the Global Times said.That is misleading.To be sure, China did ramp up purchases of goods and services. But trade data from both Bloomberg and the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) showed that, as of the end of November 2021, purchases met only 60 percent of China’s pledge.The Phase One deal set specific targets for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural, manufactured and energy products and certain traded services.“[H]ere's the deal with Chinese friends, they're about $16 billion light over what they committed to purchase [U.S. agricultural products]. And that's why Ambassador Tai, our U.S. trade representative, is going to China and continues to converse with China about the necessity of living up totally and completely to the Phase One trade agreement, making up that $16 billion deficit over the course of the next several years,” said Vilsack at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Atlanta on January 10.Reuters reported that Vilsack said on January 11 that “the U.S. will continue to press China on the need for complete enforcement of the trade deal before discussing extensions.”According to PIIE’s calculations, as of November 2021, China was 22 percent short on its agriculture goal, 44 percent short on the manufactured goods goal, and 65 percent short on the energy goal.For U.S. agricultural exports, China pledged to buy $73.9 billion in the two-year period, but had actually purchased $57.4 billion as of November 2021.For U.S. manufactured product exports, China bought $117.8 billion from 2020 through November 2021, falling well short of the $210.7 billion needed to meet the target.For U.S. energy exports, the purchase target set in the trade deal was $67.7 billion, but as of November 2021, China had only bought $24 billion.The PIIE tracker did not include data on China’s purchases of certain services from the United States. The Wall Street Journal separately reported that annual data showed a 32 percent drop in U.S. service exports to China for 2020.China has blamed pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions for the shortfalls, while according to The New York Times, “it is unclear how receptive the Biden administration is to that argument or whether the president will take action against China for not living up to its end of the deal.”Experts said it’s not surprising that China failed to meet such ambitious purchasing targets.“Obviously the pandemic started early in 2020, but a big chunk of it was just that the targets were unrealistic to begin with,” Chad P. Bown of the PIIE told the Times in December.“There was no chance China would be able to, in essence, double its [purchase of] U.S. exports in two years,” wrote Forbes trade columnist Ken Roberts.But Jamieson Greer, former chief of staff to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during the Trump administration, told the Journal that U.S exports to China, despite missing the targets, were still strong in 2020 and 2021.“It’s preferable to have high targets and achieve historic exports like we did in 2020 and 2021 thanks to the phase one deal, as opposed to hoping that China will simply start buying what we are selling based on market principles,” said Greer.Though falling short on its pledges, data indeed show that U.S. exports to China are at a record level.Roberts said that exports saw an 18 percent increase when comparing the first 10 months of 2021. Through last October, U.S. exports to China totaled $121.6 billion, which is doubling the total of the first 12 months of 2009.The Journal reported that U.S. beef, pork, and poultry producers sold record amounts to China in 2020 or 2021, and while other farm exports fell short, they were still near records. China imported $14.1 billion of soybeans in 2020, only slightly below the $14.2 billion record in 2016.Purchases of U.S. semiconductors exceeded the trade deal target, an exception. Bown at PIIE told South China Morning Post (SCMP) that Chinese companies like Huawei have stockpiled U.S. semiconductors over the past two years, anticipating that the U.S. might ban exports to China on national security grounds.Purchasing commitments are just one part of the trade deal. Phase one also stipulated terms and pledges on structural reforms on intellectual property protection, financial services, macroeconomic policies and exchange rate matters and transparency.Given that China’s state-owned enterprises have been behind the record agricultural purchases, some experts see irony in the trade deal.“This would have necessitated a degree of state intervention in the market to make up for the absence of ‘genuine demand.’ And that runs counter to the US’ overall gripes with China’s economic model,” Nick Marro, lead global trade analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told SCMP.Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) told the Journal that the purchase targets reinforced Chinese state control. “It empowers all the wrong parts of the Chinese system that we want to disappear,” he said.";https://www.thedailyscoop.com/news/retail-industry/white-house-will-push-china-make-16b-trade-deficit-phase-one-vilsack-tells,https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/china-set-to-fall-short-on-promises-to-u-s-as-trade-deal-ends,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1245682.shtml,https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods,https://soundcloud.com/wnax-radio/sec-vilsack-on-china-and-conservation-program,https://www.reuters.com/business/china-hopes-us-can-enable-more-trade-amid-phase-1-deal-uncertainties-2022-01-13/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-fell-short-on-trade-deal-promises-creating-dilemma-for-biden-11640946782,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/business/economy/china-trump-trade-deal-biden.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/12/24/surprise-surprise-trumps-2019-china-trade-deal-which-never-had-a-chance-to-fall-short/?sh=1d63e1d31cc2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-fell-short-on-trade-deal-promises-creating-dilemma-for-biden-11640946782,https://www.ustradenumbers.com/united-states/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/12/24/surprise-surprise-trumps-2019-china-trade-deal-which-never-had-a-chance-to-fall-short/?sh=1d63e1d31cc2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-fell-short-on-trade-deal-promises-creating-dilemma-for-biden-11640946782,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160149/us-china-trade-deal-set-expire-insiders-reveal-whats-really,https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-fell-short-on-trade-deal-promises-creating-dilemma-for-biden-11640946782;China Fibs About Progress on U.S. Trade Deal;;;;;;
119;;;;False;China Daily;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-us-navy-south-china-sea/6743245.html;In South China Sea, Beijing Turns Reality Upside Down;2022-01-17;polygraph;;On January 7, the state-run China Daily newspaper posted a propaganda video accusing the United States of using “so-called freedom of navigation operations to provoke China and destabilize the region.”The video, titled “U.S. Navy threatens livelihoods in South China Sea,” prominently features a Chinese fisherman it describes as “being one of many fishermen who have witnessed the U.S. Navy flexing its muscles.”The fisherman claims U.S. vessels destroy the buoys and nets of Chinese fishermen. It also speculates about the USS Connecticut (SSN-22), a Seawolf-class nuclear attack submarine damaged last October in a collision with an underwater mountain in the South China Sea.In the video, a Chinese military expert, looking at a satellite image, claims a nuclear leak cannot be ruled out, reiterating a Chinese Foreign Ministry talking point. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly tried to use the sub incident to undermine U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations in the region.Asked about the incident, the fisherman in the video claims that a nuclear leak could damage the marine ecosystem, which sustains his livelihood. One commentator in the video states claims the real U.S. goal is to preserve dominance in the region, not freedom of navigation.This is all nonsense.In fact, it is China, not the United States, which has repeatedly used military force against fishermen and maritime vessels in the region. Those actions, in tandem with China’s sweeping and illegal maritime claims, are what prompted U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations.Chinese tourists take photos with the Chinese national flag as they visit Quanfu Island, one of Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea on September 14, 2014.The video’s depiction of a lone, struggling fisherman bears no resemblance to the realities of China’s vast fishing fleet, which is notorious for its aggressive tactics, including ramming competitors and foreign patrol ships.China has sent warships to escort illegal fishing expeditions – actions that some analysts have warned could lead to armed conflict.Despite China's protests of U.S. vessels operating in international waters in the South China Sea, Chinese fishing vessels have systematically engaged in illegal fishing, particularly off of the coast of South America, imperiling their ecosystems.Chinese ships have also been accused of turning off their GPS tackers in order to illegally fish around protected waters outside of the Galápagos Marine Reserve near Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone, Seafoodsource.com reported.It is also Beijing that is threatening peace in the South China Sea through aggressive actions against its neighbors.For example, last November, Chinese coast guard ships deployed water cannons to stop Filipino ships from delivering food to Filipino troops on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, located in the eastern part of the South China Sea.The Philippines called the actions of China’s coast guard illegal and asked it to “back off.”In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague, which has rebuked many of China’s sweeping claims to the South China Sea, ruled that Second Thomas Shoal is part of the Philippines' continental shelf and lies within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea recognizes the 200-nautical mile stretch of sea from the coast of a state as its EEZ. But China has ignored The Hague’s ruling, and continues to illegally blockade the shoal.In 1994, China also seized nearby Mischief Reef, which The Hague also ruled is part of the Philippines’ continental shelf. And China seized the Scarborough Shoal, some 137 miles east of the Philippines’ island of Luzon, and has captured islands and reefs from Vietnam.The November incident between the Filipino ships and China’s coast guard was not isolated.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, China has sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the Paracel Islands, another disputed South China Sea archipelago. An April 2020 attack on a Vietnamese fishing boat drew a protest from Hanoi, which Beijing ignored. Two months later, the Chinese Coast Guard attacked another Vietnamese vessel.The USS Carl Vinson is anchored at Tien Sa Port in Danang, Vietnam, on March 5, 2018.China has also used military force to prevent Vietnam and Malaysia from carrying out exploratory activities within their claimed EEZs.Last February, the Voice of America reported that China passed a law granting its Coast Guard the power to fire on foreign ships in the South China Sea, the stated goal being, among other things, safeguarding its “maritime rights and interests.”The move puts countries like Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, all of which have competing claims in the South China Sea, in the crosshairs.This week, the U.S. State Department’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs released a report covering China’s attempts to assert maritime dominance in the region.It found that China “unlawfully claims sovereignty or some form of exclusive jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea” and that those claims “gravely undermine the rule of law in the oceans and numerous universally recognized provisions of international law reflected in [UNCLOS].”The report covers many illegal Chinese actions, including Beijing’s drawing of “straight baselines” that “enclose the islands, waters, and submerged features within vast areas of ocean space in the South China Sea.”China carrying out land reclamation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands on May 11, 2015.According to the United Nations, straight baselines “[join] the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago.” Those baselines are used to determine the territorial waters of archipelagic states.However, the United States and outside experts have argued that China, as a continental state, cannot draw baselines around entire dispersed island groups, thereby claiming the waters around them as their own.The report also refers to the 2016 South China Sea Arbitration at The Hague, which covered the so-called “nine-dash line,” a boundary imposed by Beijing that Beijing claims gives China control over most of the South China Sea.The Hague found that China’s claims regarding the nine-dash line “are contrary to [UNCLOS] and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China’s maritime entitlements under the Convention.”British journalist and scholar Bill Hayton found the U.S. report to be “very good … clear, balanced, based on good evidence and well argued.”He tweeted that the report “will be a standard reference for future discussions on the legality of China's claims in the South China Sea.”Meantime, China’s reaction to the USS Connecticut’s underwater collision has been linked to a trilateral defense partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom.Alexander Neill, a defense and security consultant based in Singapore, told the Voice of America’s sister organization Radio Free Asia (RFA) that China was “playing up the risks” of the USS Connecticut incident, as it came roughly two weeks after Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced the creation of the AUKUS defense pact.AUKUS, among other things, entails the delivery of a nuclear-powered submarine fleet to Australia.“In the light of AUKUS and China’s anti-AUKUS narrative, [the Connecticut incident] is a windfall for Beijing, perfect for the narrative that the U.S. and allies are nuclearizing the South China Sea and violating counter proliferation regimes,” Neill told RFA.Neil added there was no nuclear leak or damage to the USS Connecticut’s nuclear propulsion system, reiterating a statement made by the U.S. Navy days after the incident.Purported concerns over the USS Connecticut incident have not stopped China from ramping up its own nuclear arsenal and nuclear submarine fleet.A senior Pentagon official told Newsweek in late October that “China is expanding their undersea warfare capability to extend beyond the South China Sea.”;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3151724/china-demands-answers-us-nuclear-submarine-accident-south,https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-fishing-fleet-the-worlds-largest-drives-beijings-global-ambitions-11619015507,https://www.businessinsider.com/us-warns-chinas-aggressive-fishing-boats-could-start-a-war-2019-1,https://www.brinknews.com/fishing-in-dangerous-waters-a-new-flashpoint-for-latin-america-and-china/,https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/environment-sustainability/four-south-american-countries-prepare-to-challenge-chinese-fishing-abuses-at-comm9,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-coast-guard-blocks-philippine-boats-in-disputed-sea/6317921.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN21M072,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-fisheries-society-condemns-china-attack-on-boat-demands-compensation-4115245.html,https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/chinas-pressure-costs-vietnam-1-billion-in-the-south-china-sea/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/malaysian-oil-exploration-vessel-leaves-south-china-sea-waters-after-standoff-idUSKBN22O1M9,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_chinas-coast-guard-can-fire-foreign-vessels-complicating-security-south-sea/6202209.html,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LIS150-SCS.pdf,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part4.htm,https://www.polygraph.info/a/us-navy-expelled-south-china-sea/31358405.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/sub-10132021100149.html,https://www.cpf.navy.mil/News/Article/2797630/statement-regarding-uss-connecticut-ssn-22/,https://www.voanews.com/a/one-reason-china-intends-to-bulk-up-its-nuclear-arsenal/6387496.html,https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/6813097/China-Naval-Modernization-and-Implications-for.pdf,https://www.newsweek.com/chinas-submarine-fleet-catching-us-causing-partners-panic-1643709;In

120;;;;Misleading;Maria Zakharova;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-taliban-russia/6743234.html;Russia’s Misleading Claims About Recognizing the Taliban;2022-01-05;polygraph;;"On December 29, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency that his government plans to send an ambassador to Moscow to replace the former Afghan diplomats.The move is part of diplomatic cooperation between Taliban and Russia, Mujahid said, although he added that “the movement has yet to receive from Russia the conditions for recognition of the government formed by the Taliban,” RIA Novosti reported.That same day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova denied Russia is engaged in talks with the Taliban about recognition.“There are no negotiations yet being held on the topic of the official recognition of the transitional government in Afghanistan,” Zakharova told the Russian news agency News.ru.The claim is misleading. While Russia hasn’t formally recognized the Taliban and keeps the group on its terror list, top Kremlin officials have been talking with the Taliban, including at diplomatic levels.In late October, Russia hosted a meeting of the so-called “Moscow Format” forum – multinational talks on a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan that Russia initiated in 2017. Besides Russia and Afghanistan, the participants included China, Pakistan and Iran. The U.S. was invited but declined.The October 2021 Moscow Format forum meeting was different from previous talks, given that the Taliban had seized control of Afghanistan in August and the Afghan delegation to the October meeting was made up exclusively of senior Taliban officials, led by the Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi.RIA Novosti reported on October 20 that the issue of “international recognition” of the Taliban government came up at the October meeting of the forum.The Russian state news agency quoted Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan, as saying: ""Of course it was raised, how could it not be. Of course, this moment will come sometime, but it will come when, and this was said by everyone to the Afghan delegation, when [the Taliban government] begins to fulfill most of the expectations of the international community, which also concerns issues of human rights and inclusiveness.”Likewise, the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported on October 30 that the “central topic of discussion” at the October meeting of the forum was “the conditions necessary for the recognition of the legitimacy of the new Afghan government.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, head of the Taliban’s political council during the multilateral peace talks on Afghanistan in Moscow, November 2018. (Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters)Although Russia hasn’t recognized the Taliban government formally, it is “de facto” taking place already, Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan Kabulov told the Russian state news outlet Sputnik on December 29.“The recognition process is taking place little by little and step by step. We are not particularly fixated on recognition or non-recognition. In fact, we have a full-fledged Russian embassy. De facto recognition is already taking place with such separate small steps,” Kabulov said.Putin commented on recognizing the Taliban government during his annual press conference on December 23. “As for recognition, we are working in a consolidated manner with all participants in international communication. We have our own position, I have now stated it quite clearly. We will strive to ensure that this decision is consolidated,” he said.At the Russian Investment Forum on November 30, Putin said that to “help the Afghan people,” the West, “above all the U.S.,” must “unfreeze” the Taliban’s bank accounts, and that Russia will be “moving in the direction” of removing the Taliban from the United Nations’ list of terrorist organizations.On December 31, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the conditions for “official recognition” of the Taliban government is that it must “uphold its promises,” including by creating an “inclusive government” and by fighting terrorism and drug trafficking.Lavrov said Russia will work “in solidarity with the rest of the world community” to remove the Taliban from the United Nations’ sanctions list, “and this would already create the foundation for the official recognition of their power in Afghanistan.”A group of Russian investors visited Afghanistan and met with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, the Taliban announced on January 3. The Russians discussed investment in the Afghan oil and gas sector and building factories and mills in the cement and metal industries, a Taliban spokesman said.There are signs the Kremlin is already moving in the direction outlined by Putin and Lavrov. The Russian state-owned media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya, which includes RT (formerly Russia Today), Sputnik and RIA Novosti, has reportedly been prohibited from labeling the Taliban as a terrorist organization in its reports.Instead, Russian state media now describe the Taliban as an organization “under U.N. sanctions for terrorist activities.”Here are RT’s old and new descriptions of the Taliban:OLD:* «Талибан» – организация признана террористической по решению Верховного суда РФ от 14.02.2003.""The Taliban"" – the organization is recognized as a terrorist organization by a decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated 02/14/2003.NEW:* Организация находится под санкциями ООН за террористическую деятельность.* The organization is under UN sanctions for terrorist activitiesThe Taliban pledged to provide safety for all Russian diplomatic staff in the country, Kabulov said in July. He quoted the organization’s political leader, Abdel Ghani Baradar, as ordering Taliban commanders that “not a single dust particle shall fall” on the Russian consulate.Kabulov portrayed the Taliban as Russia’s partner in fighting Islamic State. “They hate them and don’t take them prisoners; they destroy them,” Kabulov told RIA Novosti.Russia had been holding talks with the Taliban for years before it regained control of Afghanistan in August as the U.S. pulled out.According to RT, Taliban envoys visited Moscow for an official, closed meeting with Lavrov in November 2018. They met again in Moscow in February and May 2019. In 2021, Taliban representatives visited Moscow four times – in January, March, July, and October.NBC News reported in September 2020 that Russia had for years been providing financial and military support to the Taliban. After regaining control over Afghanistan, the Taliban has been actively seeking the recognition of the international community, including the United States. The United States held on-and-off peace talks with the top Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar, starting in 2012 to ensure a safe exit for the American troops as well as to obtain security guarantees from the Taliban.The Doha talks continued with several short breaks until February 2020, when under Trump's administration the United States and the Taliban signed a peace agreement. The United States outlined the withdrawal of its troops, and the Taliban promised that Afghanistan wouldn’t be used for terrorist activities.Last fall, the United States resumed direct talks with the Taliban in Qatar to discuss the post-withdrawal humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and anti-terrorism measures.The Taliban announced in October that the United States would provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Washington said the provision of aid involved “robust and humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people” and that the talks did not include a discussion of the issue of diplomatic recognition.";https://ria.ru/20211229/talib-1765982521.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://afginrussia.ru/en/tech_days_off,https://news.ru/world/zaharova-prokommentirovala-namereniya-talibov-naznachit-posla-v-moskve/,http://nac.gov.ru/terroristicheskie-i-ekstremistskie-organizacii-i-materialy.html,https://www.dw.com/ru/moskovskij-format-o-chem-taliby-dogovarivajutsja-s-kremlem/a-59521358,https://ria.ru/20211020/vopros-1755392985.html,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20211020/taliby-1755417289.html,https://rg.ru/2021/10/30/ekspert-mgimo-o-tom-kakoe-budushchee-zhdet-afganistan-pri-talibah.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://az.sputniknews.ru/20211229/priznanie-pravitelstva-talibov-de-fakto-uzhe-proiskhodit--437717156.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://ria.ru/20211223/taliban-1765166202.html?in=t,https://dailystorm.ru/news/putin-prizval-zapad-razblokirovat-scheta-talibana-v-bankah?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://russian.rt.com/world/news/944798-lavrov-taliby-priznanie,https://www.interfax.ru/world/813757,https://rus.ozodi.org/a/31552395.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://lenta.ru/news/2021/07/14/sohrannost/,https://lenta.ru/news/2021/07/14/little_helpers/,https://russian.rt.com/opinion/884638-yuzik-rossiya-peregovory-taliby,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-commander-intel-still-hasn-t-established-russia-paid-n1240020,https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/24/us-to-resume-talks-with-taliban-in-qatar-state-department,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58866161;Russia’s Misleading Claims About Recognizing the Taliban;;;;;;
121;;;;Misleading;Dmitry Peskov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/6743233.html;The Kremlin’s Evasive ‘No Comment’ on Rights Group Shutdown;2022-01-05;polygraph;;"On December 29, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked to comment on the closure of Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest human rights groups, known mostly for compiling lists of victims of political repression in the Soviet Union. The previous day, Russia’s Supreme Court had ordered the organization to shut down, allegedly for violating Russia’s “foreign agents” law.Peskov declined to comment, stating: ""These are court decisions. We never comment on court decisions.” That is both evasive and false.In fact, there are many examples of the Kremlin commenting on court cases. Perhaps most famous was Vladimir Putin’s response in 2010 to a question about the jailing of Russian businessman and oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Moreover, Putin commented on the case against Memorial as recently as December 9, when he claimed that the organization’s lists of victims of Stalin-era political repression included individuals who had worked for the police under the Nazis, and who had arrested Jews and sent Jewish prisoners to their place of execution. A day before Peskov’s no comment, prosecutor Alexei Zhafyarov echoed Putin’s comments about Memorial, claiming before the Supreme Court that Memorial ‘s lists of victims of Stalinist repression also contained ""Nazi offenders with [the] blood of Soviet citizens on their hands."" ""It is obvious that Memorial creates a false image of the USSR as a terrorist state by speculating on the topic of political repression of the 20th century,"" Zhafyarov said during the December 28 hearing, German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported.Memorial says its lists of victims of Stalin-era repression are based on the official state records of people who were rehabilitated by the Soviet authorities.Memorial was charged with violating Russia’s so-called “foreign agents” law after the organization was officially designated as a foreign agent in 2016. This past November, a Memorial representative claimed it had already paid all the fines levied against it for allegedly violating the foreign agents law. Prosecutors allege that Memorial failed to properly label its published materials as produced by a designated foreign agent, as the law requires.A woman in a face covering with messages reading ""There Is No Way To Ban Memorial"" and ""We"" is seen outside the Supreme Court of Russia during a hearing to consider a bid by the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office to close down Memorial on December 14. (TASS/Stanislav Krasilnikov)Based on the Supreme Court verdict, Memorial will have to shut down unless it wins an appeal. The court’s decision drew criticism from a number of countries and organizations, including the United Nations human rights office and the European Court of Human Rights.Russia’s foreign agents law was introduced in 2012 and was originally aimed at noncommercial organizations receiving funding from abroad that engaged in “political activity.” Critics have often pointed out how vague the criteria are for what constitutes political activity.For example, in 2015 Russia’s Dynasty Foundation, which was primarily involved in funding scientific research, fell afoul of the law and was forced to shut down. (Peskov commented on that court case at the time.)In more recent years, the foreign agent law has been modified and applied more liberally, affecting news organizations, individual journalists, YouTubers, and activists. Once designated a foreign agent, an individual or organization must place a disclaimer on all published content, as well as provide financial records to the government. Failure to comply can lead to steep fines.In 2017, Russia placed the U.S. Congress-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Current Time TV on the list of foreign agents. Current Time is a Russian-language collaboration produced by RFE/RL and Voice of America, whose Russian-language news service was also designated a foreign agent. More than $4 million in fines have piled up against RFE/RL, which disputes the foreign agent label and filed a legal challenge in the European Court of Human Rights.";https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/world/europe/17russia.html,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/putin-russia-human-rights-memorial-1.6280093,https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/73355/,https://www.dw.com/en/russia-orders-closure-of-human-rights-group-memorial/a-60273615,https://tass.com/society/1366345,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscow-court-shuts-down-russias-memorial-human-rights-centre-2021-12-29/,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/31/1021804569/russias-foreign-agent-law-targets-journalists-activists-even-ordinary-citizens,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/31/1021804569/russias-foreign-agent-law-targets-journalists-activists-even-ordinary-citizens,https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-foreign-agents-europe-/31346269.html;The Kremlin’s Evasive ‘No Comment’ on Rights Group Shutdown;;;;;;

Business ownership has become a growing controversy in Egypt with the country’s military-owned companies’ continued encroachment on the civilian economy.In November, Naguib Sawiris, a 67-year-old Egyptian billionaire telecommunications tycoon, told AFP that competition between the private sector and military-owned companies is “unfair,” adding that ""[c]ompanies that are government-owned or with the military don't pay taxes or customs.”Ignoring the complains that private Egyptian companies face unfair competition, el-Sissi claimed that those companies are the ones working in the country.“We say that Egyptian private companies are the ones that are working in Egypt, and I call these companies to invest in other fields,” el-Sissi said. That is misleading. Egypt’s army has played a role in the country’s economy for decades. However, experts, investigative journalists and human rights watchdogs say that since el-Sissi took power in 2013, the army’s hold on the civilian economy has grown to an unprecedented level. In 2013, el-Sissi, formerly Egypt’s army chief, led a military coup that ousted the country’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi. In 2014, el-Sissi won presidential elections with 97% of the vote and the military’s blessings. International observers said the vote fell short of democratic standards.Since then, military organizations, including the Egyptian Defense Ministry, Ministry of Military Production and the Egypt-based Arab Organization for Industrialization have expanded their business interests in Egypt.Reuters reported in 2018 that military-run industries have transitioned from manufacturing armaments to making goods like medical devices, building greenhouses and even gyms. In 2016, el-Sissi signed into law legislation exempting military-owned companies and security institutions from paying value-added tax (VAT) on goods, equipment, services and raw materials needed for armaments, national security and defense.Egypt’s Defense Ministry determines which goods and services are exempted from VAT, and local business people say this system is open to abuse.Egypt’s army is the Arab world’s largest, and it enjoys the support of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which backed el-Sissi against the Muslim Brotherhood.One megaproject is the construction of the New Administrative Capital, covering 170,000 acres 45km (28 miles) from Cairo with a cost of about $40 billion. The new capital will house Egyptian government buildings, embassies and businesses and accommodate about 6.5 million people.The company in charge of the project is the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), 51% of which is controlled by Egypt’s army, with the remaining 49% owned by Egypt’s Ministry of Housing. The military will be running and managing the project.Egypt’s military will “reap enormous financial benefits from this ambitious endeavour. The ACUD, in which the military has the majority stake, is in charge of selling housing units in the new capital,” Mustafa Menshawy, a post-doctoral research fellow at the U.K.’s University of Lancaster, wrote in an op-ed published by Al Jazeera in July.The Egyptian military’s growing control over the state and society is overwhelming the private sector and discouraging foreign investors, the Financial Times wrote in June.“There are 60 companies affiliated to military entities operating in 19 of the 24 industries of the Global Industry Classification Standards, an industry taxonomy body, according to the World Bank report. The military’s National Service Projects Organization (NSPO) controls 32, a third of which were established after 2015,” the FT said. Citing analysts, the FT added that el-Sissi fears Egyptian businessmen gaining political influence that could fuel an upheaval like the one that brought Morsi to power in 2012.Timothy Kaldas, an independent risk adviser and nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, wrote in a December 2020 Bloomberg op-ed that most of the contracts for Egypt’s megaprojects are funneled to military-owned companies, which in turn, subcontract private companies to do much of the work. The military determines which companies win the contracts and thereby ensures “their dependence on the government for access to state spending,” Kaldas wrote, adding: “Not only does control over the production and distribution of wealth allow the government to buy loyalty, it also prevents the emergence of any competition.”In November 2020, Human Rights Watch, the Freedom Initiative and Cairo Institute for Human Rights sent a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after it approved a $5.2 billion loan to Egypt. The IMF accepted an Egyptian government report on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that did not mention businesses owned by the Defense Ministry or the Ministry of Military Production.The three NGOs urged the IMF Board to “insist that Egyptian authorities include military-owned businesses in all transparency requirements that apply to state-owned enterprises.”Egypt has received $20 billion in IMF loans since 2016.There are no official estimates of the size of private companies’ participation in Egypt’s economy. However, Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait announced in October that the government will increase the private sector’s participation in the economy to 50%.Egypt’s Central Bank said economic growth in 2020-2021 reached 3.3%. In a Reuters poll, economists predict an annual urban consumer inflation to reach 6.0 percent in 2021-2022, but still under the Central Bank’s limits. Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics reported that unemployment rose to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 0.2 percent from the second quarter.In 2021, poverty decreased in Egypt to 29.3% compared with 32% in 2020, according to the website Statista, a provider of market and consumer data.";https://www.rfi.fr/en/business-and-tech/20211121-billionaire-sawiris-wants-level-playing-field-for-egypt-business,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/world/middleeast/international-observers-find-fault-with-egypt-vote.html,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/egypt-economy-military/,http://admin.mhuc.gov.eg//Dynamic_Page/636651628631802507.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-government-begin-move-new-administrative-capital-december-2021-11-03/,http://www.acud.eg,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/7/5/why-is-egypt-building-a-new-capital,https://www.ft.com/content/00a7b285-87c8-448c-998e-30457d1af85c,https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/poverty/33EF03BB-9722-4AE2-ABC7-AA2972D68AFE/Global_POVEQ_EGY.pdf,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-24/egypt-s-military-companies-aren-t-going-anywhere,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/30/letter-imf-executive-board-re-transparency-egypts-military-firms,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/30/imf-demand-transparency-egypt-militarys-firms#,https://www.asharqbusiness.com/article/30400,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/egypt-economy-forecast-grow-51-year-june-55-202223-2021-10-21/,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1970091/business-economy,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237041/poverty-headcount-ratio-in-egypt/;Sisi Downplays Military’s Encroachment on Egyptian Economy;;;;;;

(Anthony Devlin/REUTERS)The Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom responded the next day with “strong opposition,” deeming the G-7 comments “irresponsible.”“The accusation that China implemented ‘coercive economic policies’ is totally groundless,” reads a statement from the embassy.That is false.In fact, China has increasingly employed coercive economic measures as a foreign policy tool over the past decade, in the process becoming “the world’s leading practitioner of geoeconomics,” wrote Robert Blackwill and Jennifer Harris in their book, “War by Other Means: Geoeconomics and Statecraft.”Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, testified at a December 7 U.S. congressional hearing on “How China Uses Economic Coercion to Silence Critics and Achieve its Political Aims Globally.” She noted that coercive economic measures are defined as “a threatened or actual imposition of economic costs by a state on a target with the objective of extracting a policy concession.”As China rose to become the top trading nation for two-thirds of the world’s countries, then emerged as the world’s largest development financer and second-largest economy and market, its economic importance has provided strong leverage to impose its will.The “Authoritarian Interference Tracker” maintained by the Alliance for Securing Democracy cites 68 cases of economic coercion by China in the last decade. The tracker reports on Chinese and Russian attempts to undermine democracy by economic and other means.Since 2010, China has regularly punished countries economically for perceived challenges to its territorial claims, national sovereignty, domestic political system, or other “core interests,” according to ​the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a Washington, D.C. think tank.Following are some recent examples of China’s actions from the Authoritarian Interference Tracker and other sources.Trade RestrictionsTrade restriction includes the imposition of export and import limits, tariff increases, targeted customs inspections, license denials, informal embargoes, and selective use of international regulations.On December 3, for example, China removed Lithuania as a country of origin in its customs portal, effectively suspending all imports from or exports to Lithuania. The change came after the Baltic country allowed Taiwan to open an office in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital.China views self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its territory under its “One China” principle. On December 9, China stepped up pressure by urging multinational companies to break ties with Lithuania or face losing access to the vast Chinese market.Since 2020, in response to Australia’s call for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has placed restrictions on a variety of Australian exports to China.In 2010, China also restricted exports of rare earth elements to Japan after a Chinese fishing boat and a Japanese coast guard ship collided near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.In 2011, China restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after Chinese pro-democracy dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In 2012, China reduced imports of bananas and other fruits from the Philippines amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea.In 2016, China restricted trade with South Korea after an agreement between Seoul and Washington to deploy a U.S. missile defense system. The same year, China imposed temporary restrictions on cross-border trade with its northern neighbor Mongolia for hosting the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who Beijing views as a separatist.Tourism CurbsLeveraging its large number of outbound tourists, China has inflicted economic pain on foreign governments by suspending package tours organized through state-run travel agencies, issuing official travel warnings, and banning permits for independent travelers, according to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.In 2016, Beijing reduced tourism to Taiwan after the election victory of Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party. According to the CNAS report, the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan dropped 22% the next year.In 2017, when China retaliated against Seoul’s deployment of the THAAD missile defense system by imposing trade restrictions on South Korea, it also banned tours there, inflicting an estimated $15.6 billion loss in revenue on the country, according to Hyundai Research Institute. The number of Chinese tourists to South Korea fell from 130,000 per month to fewer than 3,000, CNAS said.China froze tourism to the Philippines in 2012 amid a dispute over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Following protests against China in Manila, China cited “strong anti-China sentiment” as a pretext for suspending indefinitely all tours to the Philippines.“Tourism appears likely to be an attractive Chinese coercive economic tool in the coming years, given that Chinese tourists are now the world’s largest-spending overseas tourists,” the 2018 CNAS report stated. “Restrictions on tourism are also likely appealing because they can impose meaningful economic costs on target countries with few collateral costs on China.”Targeting Global FirmsOn November 22, Taiwan's Far Eastern Group company and its subsidiaries were fined nearly $14 million for alleged violations at factories in five Chinese provinces, according to China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO). The company had donated to Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, which opposes the mainland’s “One China” principle.Though claiming the fines were based on Chinese laws and regulation, the TAO spokesperson said China “will absolutely not allow people who support Taiwan independence or destroy cross-Taiwan Strait relations, who dare bite the hand that feeds them, to make money in the mainland.”On November 30, the company’s chairman published an article affirming that he had long opposed Taiwan's independence and supported the “one-China principle.”In 2019, China canceled digital streaming of Houston Rockets basketball games after the team’s general manager, Daryl Morey, voiced support for Hong Kong pro-democracy movement on Twitter. The NBA issued a public apology, and Daryl Morey left his job.In 2018, the Civil Aviation Administration of China demanded that international airlines and hotels cease listing Taiwan as a country on their websites or risk facing “disciplinary actions.” All the companies complied, with some apologizing for the listing.As the German Marshall Fund's Bonnie Glaser noted in her December 7 U.S. congressional testimony, in 2017, following tension over the THAAD anti-missile system, Beijing refused certification of Korean-made batteries for hybrid-electric cars, which effectively banned the sale in China of cars equipped with batteries from LG Chem and Samsung SDI. That year, Beijing cited purported fire-code violations to shut down almost 90 Chinese stores owned by South Korea’s Lotte Group after Lotte provided a golf course for a THAAD site.China is not the only country that uses economic pressure to advance foreign policy goals and protect “core interests.”The statement from the Chinese Embassy in London pointed a finger at the United States and said China is the victim of U.S. economic coercion:“Speaking of ‘coercive economic policies,’ who imposed [an] economic embargo and blockade on China in the 1950s and 1960s, and who waged trade war against China and mounted pressure and restriction on Chinese companies in recent years? The relevant country should answer these questions first and stop putting the blame on the victim!”China has called the United States “a skillful economic bully with various means,” citing woes about tariffs imposed on two-thirds of Chinese exports to the United States and U.S. sanctions against Chinese tech companies like Huawei.It also has criticized the United States for “antagoniz[ing] allies and stirred up tensions and disruptions in global trade and supply chains.”“Besides China, the United States has dragged an array of its partners into trade disputes and technological suppression through a series of coercive tactics,” stated an opinion piece published by China's state-run Xinhua news agency in October.However, unlike Washington and other Western governments that rely on formal legal sanctions, investment restrictions or trade controls, Beijing mainly uses informal, extralegal approaches.The Chinese “do not legally link a foreign policy dispute to the coercive measures, creating public deniability and greater optionality for escalation and de-escalation,” a CNAS report said.It added: “China typically imposes economic costs through informal measures such as selective implementation of domestic regulations, including stepped-up customs inspections or sanitary checks, and uses extralegal measures such as employing state media to encourage popular boycotts and having government officials directly put informal pressure on specific companies.”;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g7-foreign-and-development-ministers-meeting-11-12-december-2021-chairs-statements/g7-foreign-and-development-ministers-meeting-december-2021-chairs-statement,https://www.reuters.com/world/g7-is-concerned-about-chinas-coercive-economic-policies-uks-truss-2021-12-12/,https://www.cfr.org/book/war-other-means,http://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/CECC%20Hearing%20Testimony%20-%20Bonnie%20Glaser.pdf,https://www.aspi.org.au/report/chinese-communist-partys-coercive-diplomacy,https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/asd_tools/strategic-economic-coercion/,http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/China_Use_FINAL-1.pdf,https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/CECC%20Hearing%20Testimony%20-%20Bonnie%20Glaser.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-lithuania-trade/lithuania-says-chinese-customs-is-blocking-its-exports-idUSKBN2II0Y7,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-lithuania-braces-china-led-corporate-boycott-2021-12-09/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/australia-finds-new-markets-for-coal-barley-amid-china-trade-fight.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-japan-minerals/china-denies-banning-rare-earths-exports-to-japan-idUKTRE68M0PF20100923,https://www.cnbc.com/2013/08/15/norway-sees-liu-xiaobos-nobel-prize-hurt-salmon-exports-to-china.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-china-nobel-idUSTRE69A15920101011,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-philippines-banana-growers-feel-effect-of-south-china-sea-dispute/2012/06/10/gJQA47WVTV_story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-china-thaad/south-korea-complains-to-wto-over-china-response-to-missile-system-idUSKBN16R03D,https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/01/china-slaps-new-fees-on-mongolian-exporters-amid-dalai-lama-row.html,https://www.aspi.org.au/report/chinese-communist-partys-coercive-diplomacy,http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/China_Use_FINAL-1.pdf,http://www.voanews.com/a/china-objects-to-thaad-south-korea-tourism/3788460.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-objects-to-thaad-south-korea-tourism/3788460.html,http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/China_Use_FINAL-1.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-one-china-policy-principle/31499875.html,https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202111300015,https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_houston-rockets-gms-tweet-controversy-simmers-china/6177248.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-china-american-airlines-idUSKBN1KF05D,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/12/marriott-apologises-to-china-over-tibet-and-taiwan-error,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2017/01/123_221255.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/donaldkirk/2017/04/26/china-plays-hardball-with-lotte-for-playing-ball-on-thaad/?sh=7fcc0e57278f,http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/China_Use_FINAL-1.pdf,http://www.news.cn/english/2021-10/22/c_1310262821.htm,http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/China_Use_FINAL-1.pdf;China’s Issues Fatuous Denials of Economic Bullying;;;;;;
124;;;;False;Sergei Ryabkov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-kremlin-has-flagrantly-broken-budapest-pact-on-ukraine-s-security/6743228.html;Kremlin Has Flagrantly Broken Budapest Pact on Ukraine’s Security;2021-12-21;polygraph;;On December 18, the Russian news agency Interfax published an article in which Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, falsely claimed Russia had fulfilled its obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. This is the agreement by which Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan gave up their leftover Soviet nuclear arsenals in exchange for protecting their 1991 borders.“The Budapest Memorandum concerns security guarantees for Ukraine as a non-nuclear state within the meaning of the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty),” he said. “And from this point of view, all guarantees have been provided and observed.” Ryabkov went on with this obfuscating mashup:“But in the Budapest Memorandum there is not a word about coups d'etat in Ukraine and subsequent actions, nor about the possibility [of] calling things by their proper names, about a part of the population who at that time lived within Ukraine, making conclusions about whether it is worth continuing to live there or it is necessary to return to the Russian Federation.”To be clear: With its occupation of Ukrainian territory in Crimea and by nurturing a separatist war in Donbas, Russia has violated the most basic tenets of the Budapest memo.In fact, the first point of the memorandum is the following: “The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine … to respect the Independence and Sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.” Clearly, Russia has violated this point. A machine equipped with a large cutting device severs a Tu-22 strategic bomber at a military airfield in the city of Poltava, Ukraine, November 12, 2002.Ryabkov’s talk of “coups d’etat” in Ukraine is a reference to the false Russian claim that Ukraine’s 2014 “Maidan Revolution” was a coup orchestrated by the West. The argument echoes rhetoric used by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian officials since the Kremlin's forced annexation of Crimea. In this misleading narrative, the change in government after then-President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in 2014 supposedly nullified the “Ukraine” with which Russia had signed the Budapest memo and other treaties.This is sheer sophistry, since nothing in the memo suggests that a change in government somehow voids the agreement. Moreover, Russia continues to officially recognize the post-Maidan government of Ukraine.Ryabkov’s further claim about a “part of the population” in Ukraine deciding to “return to the Russian Federation” refers to the Russian fiction that the Crimean annexation was an expression of the will of the Crimean population. In reality, the “referendum” of the people was initiated by Russian military intervention, starting with the seizure of the Crimean parliament on February 27, with the voting taking place little over two weeks later under de facto conditions of a Russian occupation. The voting was not monitored by independent observers.Point two of the Budapest memo reads:“The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.” Once again, it is obvious that Russia’s actions in Crimea and in Donbas violate the use-of-force agreement. In fact, with some 100,000 troops currently deployed around Ukraine’s borders, Russia is again violating this point by deploying what Ukraine and the European Union consider threatening force.Since November, Russia has been positioning these military forces while making demands from NATO for “security assurances.” Although Russian officials have repeatedly denied any aggressive intent, there are no large-scale, scheduled military exercises to explain the buildup. Observers note the installation of logistical stockpiles, medical facilities and command-and-control structures to support military operations.In Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, Russian forces and their collaborators continue to wage war against the government. Since the fighting broke out in 2014, there have been more than 14,000 civilian and military deaths, according to Russia's count. Despite overt ties to the pseudo-states established in Donbas, (the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic,”) Russia still officially recognizes these territories as part of Ukraine.Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula following the February 2014 Maidan revolution, also known as the “Revolution of Dignity.” Yanukovych fled the country while facing consequences for the use of live rounds against protesters, among other allegations.;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/05/why-care-about-ukraine-and-the-budapest-memorandum/,https://undocs.org/CD/1285,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/publication/Issue%20Brief%20No%203--The%20Breach--Final4.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukrainian-maidan-was-not-a-coup/29098965.html,https://www.bbc.com/russian/rolling_news/2014/05/140520_rn_medvedev_ukraine,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-annexation-crimea/31129974.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-factcheck-russia-spins-pseudo-history-on-anniversary-of-crimea-seizure/31158197.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/world/europe/ukraine-nato-russia.html,https://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/index.html,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/43371/russia-bolsters-supply-lines-deploys-medical-units-near-ukraine-as-invasion-fears-grow-report,https://tass.com/world/1289095;Kremlin Has Flagrantly Broken Budapest Pact on Ukraine’s Security;;;;;;

But it arises now as Russia masses nearly 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s north, east and southeast borders in what Ukraine, the U.S. and European allies fear is a prelude to an invasion.In summary, a 2003 bilateral treaty, the “Agreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Cooperation In The use of The Sea of Above and the Kerch Straight,” states that “[t]he Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait are historically inland waters of the Russian Federation and Ukraine.”Article 2 of the treaty states: “Merchant ships and warships, as well as other state ships flying the flag of the Russian Federation or Ukraine, operated for non-commercial purposes, enjoy freedom of navigation in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait.”Also, the Sea of Azov is an inland, semi-enclosed body of water. That means it is governed by Article 123 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).A Ukrainian patrol boats in the Sea of Azov near Mariupol on June 15, 2019. (Iryna Gorbaseva/RFE/RL)Article 123 calls on states bordering an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea to “cooperate with each other in the exercise of their rights and in the performance of their duties under this Convention.”Article 19 of UNCLOS, which provides for innocent passage, allows foreign ships, even military vessels, to pass through the territorial waters of another state so long as that passage is “not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.”Still, as Polygraph.info previously noted, flaws in the 2003 bilateral treaty leave space for ambiguity.A patrol boat of the coast guard of the Border Service under Russia's Federal Security Service approaches the Kerch Strait Bridge, on December 5, 2018.Vladimir Socor of the Jamestown Foundation wrote in 2018 that the treaty makes “no reference to general international law, nor to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.”The 2003 agreement also called on the two sides to draw up a separate agreement that would determine the Sea of Azov’s borders.That never happened, and, according to a 2018 analysis by Mykhailo Samus, deputy director for international issues at Ukraine’s non-governmental Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, Russia used the resulting legal vacuum to “independently determine such borders.”However, despite that lack of clarity on the status of the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait, much of Russia’s claim rests on its annexation of Crimea, which the United Nations has not recognized. In March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, which upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity, including Crimea.So, even with the flawed 2003 treaty, Moscow’s attempts to claim the Sea of Azov based on its illegal occupation of Crimea are unsupported.Meantime, legal analysts have posited that the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov are either internal waters of Russia and Ukraine, forming part of a “single bay regime,” or “largely are part of the territorial sea of Ukraine and Russia.”Moscow, they say, has no unilateral right to restrict innocent passage. But that has not stopped Russia from attempting to establish control over the region.In November 2018, FSB border patrol boats captured three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors after firing on them.The Ukrainian foreign minister at the time, Pavlo Klimkin, said Russia’s actions violated Articles 38 and 44 of UNCLOS, which “clearly and strongly bans the obstruction of peaceful transit across the Kerch Strait,” the BBC reported.In May 2019, a U.N. Maritime Tribunal called on Russia to immediately release the Ukrainian sailors. Moscow refused to accept the tribunal’s jurisdiction in the matter, but later released the sailors under a prisoner swap.;https://ria.ru/20211210/korabl-1763124328.html,https://sputniknews.com/20211210/kremlin-kerch-strait-incident-proves-potential-harm-danger-of-such-provocative-actions-1091415249.html,https://www.chathamhouse.org/2017/06/chokepoints-and-vulnerabilities-global-food-trade-0/2-chokepoints-global-food-trade,https://www.polygraph.info/a/nato-kerch-strait-provocation/29863964.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/world/europe/ukraine-military-russia-invasion.html,https://www.mid.ru/foreign_policy/international_contracts/2_contract/-/storage-viewer/bilateral/page-154/46287,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf,https://jamestown.org/program/azov-sea-kerch-strait-evolution-of-their-purported-legal-status-part-one/,https://www.unian.info/politics/10142348-why-russia-considers-the-sea-of-azov-its-own-and-what-ukraine-should-do-about-it.html,https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/73/263,https://voelkerrechtsblog.org/ukraine-v-russia-passage-through-kerch-strait-and-the-sea-of-azov/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia/russia-ignores-western-calls-to-free-captured-ukrainian-ships-idUSKCN1NV0N1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46345317,https://www.rferl.org/a/un-tribunal-sea-ukraine-russia-ship-seized/29962293.html,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/07/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html;Ukraine Doesn’t Need Russia’s Permission to Navigate Kerch Strait;;;;;;

According to the White House, the goal is to bring together “a broad and diverse group of governmental and nongovernmental leaders from every region of the world to set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal.”Beijing reacted harshly to the planned summits for various reasons, including the fact that its claimed island republic, Taiwan, was invited while China was not.U.S. President Joe Biden convenes a virtual summit with leaders from democratic nations at the State Department's Summit for Democracy, at the White House, on December 9, 2021. (Leah Millis/Reuters)China has questioned the right of the United States to hold such a summit, saying the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. military operations abroad and issues of racial injustice undermine the country’s democratic bona fides.Moreover, Beijing rejects the idea there is a one-size-fits-all model for democracy, insisting that China is a ""democratic"" country based on the government’s purported commitment to the well-being of the Chinese people.On December 7, New China Research (NCR), the think tank of China's Xinhua News Agency, released a report on “China's Approach to Democracy, Freedom and Human Rights.”The white paper argues that the Chinese people have determined that the only criterion for democratic governance is “that ordinary people enjoy the dividends of peace and development and live peaceful and happy lives.”“The essence of modern state governance is democratic governance,” the paper states. “Well-functioning democracy can guarantee and develop freedom and human rights.”Therefore, China is democratic, the report argues:“The word ‘democracy,’ which first appeared in ancient Greece, originally meant ‘rule by the people.' In China, ‘the running of the country by the people’ has become a reality that is increasingly vivid and vigorous.”Beijing is correct to say that democracy can differ from country to country.However, it incorrectly equates effective governance, and even legitimate governance, with democratic governance.Whether China’s government is effective and/or legitimate is another issue. But it is not democratic given the restrictions on participation faced by ordinary Chinese.The two major forms of democracy are representative democracy, under which the people elect representatives who draft/vote on laws for them; and direct democracy, under which citizens directly vote on laws.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz listens to opening remarks from U.S. President Joe Biden at the start of the virtual Summit for Democracy, at the Chancellery in Berlin on December 9, 2021. (Michele Tantussi/Reuters)The United States is largely a representative democracy, although 26 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., have initiative and/or veto referendum processes, which are forms of direct democracy.China does permit limited voter participation in local elections, but there is no democratic input at the national level.China is essentially a one-party state, ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Eight small political parties are allowed to exist under the umbrella of the CCP-run United Front network, but they are not allowed to challenge the CCP.Likewise, China has an executive branch (the State Council), a legislature (the National People’s Congress), and a judiciary. But all are subordinate to the CCP.The National People’s Congress (NPC) only meets once a year, and party leaders decide on legislation prior to that session, “leading to the NPC being derisively described as a ‘rubber-stamp’ parliament,” France 24 reported.Nor are China’s courts independent from the CCP. In 2017, Supreme People’s Court Chief Justice Zhou Qiang warned against autonomous courts:“[China's courts] must firmly resist the western idea of ‘constitutional democracy,’ ‘separation of powers’ and ‘judicial independence.’ These are erroneous western notions that threaten the leadership of the ruling Communist Party and defame the Chinese socialist path on the rule of law.”Then there is the issue of civil liberties, which encyclopedia Britannica defines as “freedom from arbitrary interference in one’s pursuits by individuals or by government.”The Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House notes that “civil liberties are defended and increased against the encroachment of governments, institutions and powerful forces in society.”In a true democracy, civil liberties are a necessary limit on government power. They allow for transparency, accountability, and serve as a check against tyranny.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists various civil liberties, including the rights to life, liberty, free speech, free assembly, privacy, and free expression of thought, conscience, and religion.Within American legal thought, free speech has been viewed as ""the guardian of our democracy” and, as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo put it in 1937, the “the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.” In a democracy, people should be able to speak out against the government without fear of reprisal.Chinese authorities, however, show little regard for civil liberties.China officially recognizes five religions, for instance, while banning other religious and spiritual groups.As the U.S. State Department reported, those who insist on practicing their faith despite state restrictions have been subjected to harassment, arrest, detention, torture, imprisonment and forced indoctrination. In China’s Xinjiang region, Uyghurs and other Muslims minorities are systematically detained for modest expressions of faith.China also has one of the world’s most restrictive media environments, with access to information strictly curtailed.Reporters Without Borders recently noted in a report titled “The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China” an “acceleration of China’s violations against its own international commitments to freedom of opinion and expression” and an “unprecedented campaign of repression led by the Chinese regime in recent years against journalism and the right to information worldwide.”According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, China “remains the world’s worst jailer of journalists for the third year in a row, with 50 behind bars.” In its 2021 World Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked China 177th out of 180 countries, only two spots above North Korea.Beijing has also subjected its citizens to a system of mass surveillance that allows nearly total control. Freedom House, a Washington, D.C., human rights group, wrote in its “Freedom in the World 2021” report:“The [Chinese] government’s ability to monitor citizens’ lives and communications has increased dramatically in recent years, inhibiting online and offline conversations. Social media applications like WeChat are known to closely monitor user discussions so as to conform with government content restrictions and surveillance requests. Surveillance cameras, increasingly augmented with facial-recognition software, cover many urban areas and public transportation, and are expanding into rural regions.“The country’s evolving Social Credit System rates citizens’ trustworthiness based on a wide range of data, including financial records, purchasing behavior, video gaming habits, social acquaintances, and adherence to rules in public spaces. Devices used by police to quickly extract and scan data from smartphones, initially deployed in Xinjiang, have spread nationwide.”Chinese citizens are routinely denied the right to liberty and bodily autonomy, as is evident from reports of forced sterilization, forced labor and mass incarceration of Uyghur Muslims without due process.As evidence of ""democracy,"" China conflates human rights with the country’s rapid economic growth and gains against poverty in recent decades.Elsbeth Johnson, senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, and Rana Mitter, professor of history at Oxford, argue that it was wrong to assume that political freedom would arise from capitalism and economic freedom in China.Many Chinese citizens, they contend, do not believe democracy is necessary for economic success, but do believe “their form of government is legitimate and effective.”";https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/12/07/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-summit-for-democracy/,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-to-participate-in-us-summit-for-democracy-as-china-snubbed/6341477.html,http://www.news.cn/english/2021-12/08/c_1310357444.htm,https://ballotpedia.org/States_with_initiative_or_referendum,https://www.inkstonenews.com/china-translated/china-democracy/article/2163522,https://www.france24.com/en/20190305-chinas-rubber-stamp-parliament-glance,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-policy-law/chinas-top-judge-warns-courts-on-judicial-independence-idUSKBN1500OF,https://globalvoices.org/2017/01/20/chinas-top-judge-warns-against-the-threat-of-judicial-independence/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/civil-liberty,https://www.moadoph.gov.au/democracy/defining-democracy/#,https://www.aclu.org/other/civil-liberties-and-human-rights-implications-governments-post-911-policies,https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights,https://www.findlaw.com/civilrights/civil-rights-overview/civil-rights-vs-civil-liberties.html,https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/198/,https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-report-on-international-religious-freedom/china/,https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2021,https://rsf.org/en/reports/unprecedented-rsf-investigation-great-leap-backwards-journalism-china,https://cpj.org/reports/2021/12/number-of-journalists-behind-bars-reaches-global-high/,https://rsf.org/en/ranking,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/05/953515627/facial-recognition-and-beyond-journalist-ventures-inside-chinas-surveillance-sta,https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2021,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22311356/china-uyghur-birthrate-sterilization-genocide,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-forced-labor-uyghurs-xinjiang/31362816.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-ccp-human-rights/31330447.html,https://hbr.org/2021/05/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-china;Censorship, Surveillance, Suppression: No, China Is Not a ‘Democracy’;;;;;;

The network reported that Nuland had briefed the U.S. Senate the previous night (Dec. 6) about the administration’s planning in case Russia does invade Ukraine.“Nuland outlined the tough sanctions package being prepared by the administration in response to a potential Russian attack but acknowledged that the US' options to deter an invasion are fairly limited, a person familiar with the briefing said,” the CNN report read.The phrase “[t]he US' options to deter an invasion are fairly limited,” comes closest to what Komsomolskaya Pravda reported, but it’s a far cry from ‘we won’t be able to help.’ And it’s anonymously sourced.In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on December 7, Nuland said Russia will face “extreme consequences if they move against Ukraine aggressively again.” This basically summarizes what Biden told Putin, according to the U.S. readout of their lengthy video call.Nuland told Tapper the United States is consulting “intensively” with allies and partners about “a kind of response that would come immediately in a very painful way should Putin move.”The State Department dismissed Komsomolskaya Pravda’s story as “propaganda and disinformation” in a statement to VOA. “It's not backed up by facts when you actually read down the article itself.”Following the Biden-Putin talks, Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed a note of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow over alleged actions by the United States and its NATO allies in the Black Sea, warning that their “reckless” behavior would have “dangerous consequences.”Speaking from his residence in Sochi, on the Black Sea, on December 8, Putin raised the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, the defense pact allying the U.S., U.K., Canada, much of Europe and Turkey.“Russia conducts peace-loving foreign policy, but we have a right to provide for our own safety,” Putin said. “It would be criminal inaction on our side to spinelessly watch all that's taking place” were Ukraine to join NATO.Putin’s statement synced with a barrage of patriotic messaging that Russian TV, news agencies and social media have been directing at domestic audiences over the last few weeks.State-controlled media posted report after report referring to “tough but noble Putin/Russia,” “weak but evil Biden/U.S./NATO,” “corrupt and brainwashed Ukraine” facing “imminent occupation by NATO” and urgently in need of help from “Russia the savior.”Margarita Simonyan, chief editor of Russia’s foreign broadcasting entities, including RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik, proclaimed on national television that every war Russia has fought was “necessarily heroic and righteous.”She added that the only war the United States has fought that could fit that description “with much stretching” was the Civil War.In fact, Russia has been occupying Moldova's Transnistria region since 1992, and, under the leadership of President Putin, the Kremlin waged a war with Georgia in 2008. In 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and invaded eastern Ukraine. Russian military and state-backed mercenaries have been accused of war crimes committed in conflicts around the world, from Syria to Africa and beyond.Russia's military aggression has been routinely backed by disinformation campaigns that Polygraph.info has been monitoring and debunking over the years, as have other fact-checkers.No precise count exists of casualties of these wars and conflicts. In Ukraine alone, the death toll had reached 13,000 by 2019, according to a United Nations estimate.Russia has been beefing up its military presence on several sides of the Ukrainian borders, including in Belarus and Transnistria. The United States and European Union estimate that Russia has deployed up to 175,000 personnel along its borders with Ukraine.President Biden said he warned Putin that the United States is prepared to respond with severe economic restrictions if Russia attacks Ukraine again.""I made it very clear, if in fact he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences, severe consequences — economic consequences like none he's ever seen or ever have been seen,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on December 8.U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on December 7: “The United States is going to take every action that we can take from the point of view of both deterrence and diplomacy, to try to avert the invasion and deter the invasion into Ukraine. That is the object of our policy right now.”";https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/biden-putin-call-ukraine/index.html,https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/1468348549637320706?s=20,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-keeps-door-ajar-for-further-us-talks-/6344527.html,https://www.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4988103,https://www.rt.com/russia/542580-nato-putin-biden-talks/,https://riafan.ru/1567615-amerikancy-v-socsetyakh-nevysoko-ocenili-shansy-baidena-na-peregovorakh-s-putinym?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://tsargrad.tv/news/marija-zaharova-podelilas-silnoj-istoriej_459447?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,http://geo-politica.info/vesti-vstuplenie-ukrainy-v-nato--eto-katastrofa.html,https://voennoedelo.com/posts/id18116-uqdudk0zl0o5kv1xipb7?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&nw=1638980401000,https://t.me/margaritasimonyan/9673,http://www.rulac.org/browse/conflicts/military-occupation-of-moldova-by-russia#collapse1accord,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-cyberattcks-disinformation/31482726.html,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=russia%20crimea&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=russia%20ukraine&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=putin&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,http://www.rferl.org/a/death-toll-up-to-13-000-in-ukraine-conflict-says-un-rights-office/29791647.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-moscow-backed-separatist-in-ukraine-falsely-denies-russian-military-buildup/31599926.html,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-says-warned-putin-sanctions-160326864.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABibvmqHsIbyJg_FjCvJ1BVE7od583efBbk5FNMFaNj2Bsa2Lgls1rw84GIr4rAhszGNjiG5FqFtArVLKEHn9Lrw_EFLUly5ROH59si3viZDuGqQrbFTVj0gX1KazkSHk_6rpyW94g2cfiid_joFkCfEc27-dP8gk8lg_eL5U92t;State Department Official Did Not say U.S. Will Abandon Ukraine;;;;;;

That is misleading. Russia’s deployment of as many as 175,000 military personnel and their equipment to its border with Ukraine has been well-documented. And Russia has taken over parts of Ukraine before, absorbing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. RIA Novosti also quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said that Russia was merely moving its troops within its own territory, as its sovereignty and discretion allow.But while Russia proclaims no threat, history and the buildup itself are reasonable cause for alarm, making Pushilin's statement misleading.First, there is the history: Russia has already invaded Ukraine Pushilin’s “DNR,” along with its neighboring “Luhansk People’s Republic” (LNR), were both created by Russian military intervention. In August 2014, the two secessionist states were on the verge of defeat thanks to a renewed Ukrainian military offensive. Russia saved its proxies by sending regular military forces across the border and shelling Ukrainian forces from Russian territory. Russian military forces intervened directly again in early 2015, seizing the vital railway junction of Debaltseve despite a ceasefire stipulated by the Minsk II peace agreement. To support the puppet states materially, the Russian military has maintained bases and troops near the border with Ukraine.In April, large numbers of Russian troops also were deployed along Ukraine’s borders. And in September, an estimated 200,000 Russian and Belarusian troops took part in the Zapad 2021 military exercise.But the new buildup of troops is something different. Russian security experts have noted the lack of any scheduled major exercises that could explain it.Russian forces have been observed transporting fuel and ammunition while creating forward bases to store the material, which would be crucial for any kind of invasion.Command-and-control structures and field hospitals have also been set up. The evidence of this comes both from open-source material, such as videos posted on social media, and satellite photos showing the units deployed in their base camps.Although some still doubt Russia plans a full-scale invasion, there is a growing consensus among Western military experts that the buildup is not a bluff and that some military action is being planned.Although the Kremlin has repeatedly denied plans for new aggression, it has not denied the presence or troops as Pushilin did. At the same time, Russia has demanded U.S. “assurances” that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO.Speaking on the day of a scheduled video conference between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Peskov again denied that Russia planned to attack anyone but added that, “We have our own red lines.”Peskov’s implication that Russia is responding to “red lines” being crossed is ironic, since Russia already attacked Ukraine and the prospect of Ukrainian-NATO military cooperation was a direct response to that attack. On December 7, Biden and Putin conducted their video conference call of about two hours. According to the White House, Biden warned Putin the United States and its allies would respond with “strong economic and other measures in the event of a military escalation.” The Kremlin’s version of the call misleadingly referred to the war in Donbas as an “intra-Ukrainian” conflict and argued against “shifting responsibility on Russia” for the conflict, blaming NATO instead.The conflict, however, was initiated by Russia, and Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership in 2014 when the fighting started. Since then, the war has reportedly claimed more than 13,000 civilian and military casualties, although estimates vary.";https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/us/politics/russia-ukraine-biden-administration.html,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/12/21/russian-artillery-strikes-against-ukraine/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/biden-aims-to-prevent-russia-ukraine-conflict-but-time-is-running-out.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/07/putin-and-biden-begin-virtual-summit-amid-ukraine-conflict-fears-a75754,https://apnews.com/article/biden-putin-meeting-russia-ukraine-448047649195,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67315,https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/198372.html;As Biden and Putin Talk, Disinfo from Ukraine Separatist on Russian Military Buildup;;;;;;

Kalimwa reiterated the official CCP line that minorities in Xinjiang have not been persecuted.“The country supports the protection of the traditional culture of ethnic minorities and provides us with such good conditions to carry on our traditions,” Xinhua quoted Kalimwa as saying. “Who has seen this kind of 'genocide?' The malicious lies will eventually break in the face of facts.”Chinese President Xi Jinping on a billboard, March 21, 2021. (Ng Han Guan/Associated Press)The claim that the CCP protects the traditional culture of ethnic minorities is false. The newly-released documents add to a body of public evidence that the top Chinese Communist Party leadership is responsible for grave human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Polygraph.info and others have reported on alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang that critics say amount to demographic and cultural genocide.Among the allegations:1 million to 3 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been interned in facilities for so-called “re-education” and other “training.”The CCP has used forced sterilizations, intrauterine devices and other forms of forced birth control to reduce the Uyghur population.Chinese authorities have destroyed thousands of mosques and other religious sites in the region, corresponding with a broader stifling of religious freedom.Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been subjected to forced labor under the pretext of poverty alleviation.Uyghurs have been forced to invite Han Chinese officials into their homes and report on their lives as a form of “forced assimilation.”So what’s new?Adrian Zenz, a scholar who has written extensively about the Uyghurs' situation, says the recently-released documents implicate high-ranking Chinese government officials, including President Xi Jinping.“The big deal is that Xi Jinping really set the stage for the internment and re-education camps, and also focused on the forced labor transfers for promoting employment in factories and for population-equalizing birth control, which sounds quite innocuous on paper, but if you identify and compare the exact same phrase in policy documents in Xinjiang, you will realize that the implication is much bigger than that,” Zenz told Germany’s Deutsche Welle.According to Zenz, the documents show that Premier Li Keqiang and others “directly and indirectly demanded policies” perpetuating the mistreatment of Uyghurs.Citing the 2019 New York Times report, Zenz noted that Chen Quanguo, who became party secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in 2016, ordered local officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up.”However, the Times did not show that Xi had issued a similar command in 2014: “Those who should be seized should be seized, and those who should be sentenced should be sentenced.”In a piece published by Politico on November 27, Zenz wrote that The New York Times had only published a few transcribed pages from the Xinjiang Papers, quoting “from several but not all documents.”Zenz said the latest document release appears to be the first time “material with ‘top secret’ statements made by a Chinese head of state have leaked into the public domain.”Chinese state media has repeatedly accused Zenz, whose research has widely been cited in Western media reports on the situation in Xinjiang, of being “a right-wing Christian” seeking to slander the CCP.Xinjiang authorities have threatened legal action against Zenz for telling “blatant lies” and serving as a “puppet of the anti-China forces in the West.”Some non-Chinese critics have accused Western media and NGOs of over-relying on Zenz, claiming his research is not peer reviewed. It should be noted that the latest documents were not initially provided to Zenz, but the Uyghur Tribunal, which received them in September. The tribunal then asked Zenz to analyze them.Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that the original Xinjiang Papers were peer reviewed by James Millward, a professor at Washington, D.C.’s Georgetown University who teaches Chinese, Central Asian and world history; and David Tobin, a lecturer in east Asian studies at Britain’s University of Sheffield.According to Tobin, evidence supports Zenz’s argument “that targeting of Uyghurs intensified under Xi Jinping’s commands.”Tobin, who read the official documents which make up the Xinjiang Papers, found their “content matches what we have observed in mosque demolitions, mass internment, coercive birth controls, forced labor, ‘population optimization’ as euphemism for dispersal, and ‘Sinicization (changing through Chinese influence) of religion.’ ”He found “the documents demonstrate how policy in Xinjiang is designed, disseminated, and implementation monitored and policed by top levels of the party-state.”Millward also said he is confident the documents he reviewed “are scans of original Chinese government documents,” which are “substantially the same” as documents obtained (but not published or made available) by The New York Times.Following the 2019 Times expose, the Xinjiang government alleged the newspaper’s report had been “fabricated” at the behest of hostile domestic and foreign forces.Xinjiang’s opaque media environment complicates efforts at verification.However, the testimony of camp survivors and other witnesses, and the work of scholars, rights activists and investigative reporters, has been consistent with many of the allegations.Satellite imagery has demonstrated the existence of internment camps and provided evidence of mosque demolitions.In July 2019, the United Nations’ top human rights body called on Beijing to provide “meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent international observers, including for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.”In October 2020, the United States joined 38 other U.N. member states in condemning abuses against the Uyghurs. The U.S. government and others say some of those abuses are tantamount to genocide.China has denied the allegations, claiming that many of the measures target the ""three evils of terrorism, extremism, and separatism"" in Xinjiang.China has denied the existence of internment camps, claiming they are part of a “vocational education and training program,"" and accusations of forced labor. It claims jobs programs for Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, like the vocational education and training centers, are intended to reduce poverty (and the roots of extremism).Beijing has also denied allegations that it is attempting to reduce the Uyghur population through family planning policies, or infringe on religious rights through mosque ""rectification"" programs and other policies that critics say curtail traditional expressions of religious faith and Uyghur culture.Xu Guixiang, a deputy spokesperson for the Xinjiang regional government, looks up near a slide showing a photo of Uyghur infants during a news conference to rebut accusations of genocide in Beijing, January 11, 2021.Beijing says the allegations of genocide and forced labor are aimed at halting China's development.The United Nation Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts of killing and other measures intended to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part.Cultural genocide does not qualify as genocide under the U.N. Genocide Convention. But Zenz and others argue that Beijing's population control policies against Uyghur Muslims have led to dramatic population declines and fit the legal definition of genocide.";"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html,http://en.chinaculture.org/focus/focus/minzuwang/2005-09/13/content_382064.htm,http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/10/content_WS5def9637c6d0bcf8c4c18ac7.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-xinjiang-internment-camp-propaganda-fact-check-/29553362.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-uighur-baby-machines/31043985.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-canada-uighur-genocide/30955370.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mosque-destruction-xinjiang-china/31238038.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-forced-labor-uyghurs-xinjiang/31362816.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/campaign-11192019152349.html,https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017d-6dff-dac5-abff-edffb18d0000,https://www.dw.com/en/leaked-documents-link-top-chinese-leaders-to-crackdown-on-uyghurs/a-59988425,https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017d-6dff-dac5-abff-edffb18d0000,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-06-10/Adrian-Zenz-s-desperation-an-in-depth-look-at-his-latest-paper-10Xf1byaChq/index.html,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1240379.shtml,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/29/leaked-papers-link-xinjiang-crackdown-with-china-leadership,https://uyghurtribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27-Nov-Millward-Statement-converted.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang/government-of-chinas-xinjiang-says-leak-on-uighur-camps-fake-news-idUSKBN1XT0AF,https://uyghurtribunal.com/news/witness-after-witness-hundreds-reveal-the-atrocities-of-chinas-concentration-camps/,https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/exploring-xinjiangs-detention-facilities/#resources;documenting-xinjiangs-detention-system,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mosque-destruction-xinjiang-china/31238038.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/world/asia/china-genocide-uighurs-explained.html,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-09/17/c_139373591.htm,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-uighur-baby-machines/31043985.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mosque-destruction-xinjiang-china/31238038.html,https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-pompeo-genocide-uighur/31064113.html";China Deflects as Xinjiang Papers Implicate Xi Jinping;;;;;;

IAEA Director Rafael Grossi stated following his visit to Tehran that there were issues with safeguarding Iran’s nuclear program and a deficit in monitoring capacities. Grossi told a news conference in Vienna on November 24 an agreement had not been reached with Iran on how to resolve the issues with Iran’s JCPOA compliance.During the November 23 briefing in Tehran, Eslami blamed Iran’s “enemies” for publishing documents that raised ""some questions,” which, he said, “have now been answered."" Iran accuses the IAEA of having a political agenda and has called for the “depoliticization” of the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Tehran has also criticized IAEA reports and documents on Iran’s breaches of the JCPOA. However, Grossi said in Vienna on November 24 that the issues remain.“Our consultations and negotiations have been inconclusive,” Grossi said. “We know what the issues are, we want to restore the monitoring capacities that we need, and we have a deficit there. We have a number of outstanding issues in the case of safeguard matters.”The United States and European Union have pushed Iran to explain the uranium traces that the IAEA found in undisclosed locations dating back to the early 2000s. That have also demanded that Iran allow IAEA monitors to replace security cameras in Karaj, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Tehran, where a centrifuge workshop was the target of a sabotage attempt in July 2020, which Tehran blamed on Israel.Tehran in September agreed to allow IAEA’s inspectors “to service the identified equipment and replace their storage media which will be kept under the joint IAEA and AEOI [Atomic Energy Organization of Iran] seals in the Islamic Republic of Iran.”However, Iran did not grant the IAEA access to Karaj facility. Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA in Vienna, Kazem Gharibabadi, tweeted on September 26 that equipment in Karaj was not included in the service agreement.Grossi said before heading to Tehran that the focus is now on continuing to monitor Iran’s nuclear facilities, but that without access to the Karaj facility, the IAEA’s monitoring and verification program is “no longer intact.” “It hasn’t paralyzed what we are doing there, but damage that has been done, with a potential of us not being able to reconstruct the picture, the jigsaw puzzle,” Grossi told NBC News.On November 17, the IAEA said that Iran has boosted its highly enriched uranium to 4.5 percent, surpassing the 3.67 percent cap agreed on in the nuclear deal. Tehran’s stockpile hit 113.8kg (251 pounds) earlier this month, up from 84.3kg (186 pounds) reported in September.The agency added that Iran already has 17.7kg (39 pounds) of 60-percent enriched uranium, an increase from its previous 10kg (22 pounds).The JCPOA was signed in 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 group - the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany. Iran agreed to a long-term deal allowing U.N. inspectors to monitor its nuclear facilities and limit its activities in exchange for easing economic sanctions.In 2018, then U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran, reinstated sanctions removed by the previous U.S. administration and imposed new restrictions, isolating the U.S. from its allies and leaving the 2015 deal in tatters.Head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Eslami meets with IAEA Director General Grossi in Tehran. (Reuters)At the time, Tehran said it would remain in the deal regardless of the U.S. actions. However, later in 2020, Tehran restricted IAEA inspections of its facilities. “Two years after Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, Tehran has cut in half the time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade fuel for a nuclear bomb,” Foreign Policy magazine reported in May 2020.Since 2018, Iran has reportedly increased its uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel and developed advanced centrifuges.U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to restore the Iran deal if Tehran agrees to abide by the provisions of the 2015 accord. However, according to NBC News, the election of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi as Iran’s president in June made the Iranian government less interested in compromising.NBC News on November 23 cited unnamed experts as saying that Iran is now “anywhere from several weeks to two months away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon,” compared to an estimated “breakout time” of one year in 2015.The IAEA’s Board of Governors will meet November 24-26 to discuss, among other things, the verification and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program in light of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (endorsing the JCPOA in 2015).";https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2021/11/23/671213/Iran-IAEA-work-together-deepen-cooperation-IAEA-chief,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/23/iran-iaea-agree-to-continue-dialogue-ahead-of-vienna-talksthe-tw,https://www.iranintl.com/en/20211119626164,https://www.iaea.org/press/press-conferences,https://twitter.com/iaeaorg/status/1463463244123803652?s=20,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-iaea-uranium-nuclear-deal/31283165.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iaeas-grossi-says-iran-that-he-wants-deepen-cooperation-2021-11-23/,https://apnews.com/article/israel-middle-east-iran-business-health-8ec88ef0155326e3cad8720c1e945e00,https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/joint-statement-by-the-vice-president-and-the-head-of-atomic-energy-organization-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran-and-the-director-general-of-the-international-atomic-energy-agency,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/u-n-nuke-watchdog-chief-says-monitoring-iran-no-longer-n1282209,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/17/iaeas-grossi-to-visit-tehran-ahead-of-vienna-nuclear-talks,https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/feb/22/iaea-compromise-inspections,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/122460/full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal.pdf,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33521655,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/08/iran-advances-nuclear-program-withdrawal-jcpoa/,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-weighs-grim-options-nuclear-talks-iran-collapse-rcna6387,https://www.vindobona.org/article/whats-on-the-agenda-for-the-iaea-board-of-governors-meeting-november-24-26-2021,https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/mediaadvisories/press-arrangements-for-iaea-board-of-governors-meeting-24-26-november-2021;Iran’s Atomic Chief Falsely Claims ‘No Deviations’ in Nuclear Program;;;;;;

Apart from tensions over Russia’s actions in and around Ukraine since 2014, Russia’s ally Belarus has set off a crisis with its neighbors Lithuania and Poland by attempting to push migrants across the other countries’ borders. Meanwhile, as many as 100,000 Russian troops have been deployed near the borders of Ukraine with no stated purpose or scheduled exercise to explain the presence. Popov claimed the Russian nuclear-powered submarine sank in the Barents Sea after colliding with a NATO submarine belonging either to the United States Navy or the British Royal Navy.""The submarine which collided with the Kursk was following the Kursk, apparently, but was unable to ensure safety in those sea conditions and all other conditions, it got too close, or the Kursk's maneuvering led to a loss of contact,” Popov told RIA Novosti. “I know the name of it with a 90% probability, but in order to publicly name it, you need to have evidence and lay it out. I can't lay it out. A NATO submarine. And it was there, in the area where it collided with the Kursk."" That claim is false.A Russian government investigation found in 2002 that the Kursk was sunk by a catastrophic explosion that occurred when propellent from a faulty torpedo ignited, setting off other torpedoes stored in the sub’s bow, following an accident that occurred during a major Russian naval exercise. All 118 crew members aboard were killed. Popov admitted he has no evidence for his theory, while the RIA Novosti story acknowledged that Russia’s own official version does not blame the sinking of the Kursk on a collision.“According to the official version of a Russian government commission, announced in July 2002, the Kursk nuclear submarine was lost as a result of a thermal explosion of the fuel components of a 65-76 torpedo, which led to a subsequent detonation,” the RIA Novosti article noted.The disaster, which took place during Vladimir Putin’s first year as Russia’s president, became a scandal after it was revealed that it took officials several hours to confirm the sub’s disappearance and that offers of help from the United Kingdom and Norway were rejected.In addition, when Putin met with relatives of the lost crew members, some of them charged that the fleet had mishandled the rescue operation and criticized the lack of transparency about what had happened. Popov’s theories are not new: he and other Russian officials have floated these claims since 2000. Moreover, Russia’s Navy was accused of initially downplaying the situation, and Popov allegedly waited hours before ordering a search for the missing sub. Popov has claimed that one of three NATO subs that were observing Russian naval exercises at the time of the Kursk disaster -- the USS Toledo and USS Memphis of the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy’s HMS Splendid -- might have been responsible for it.There is no evidence that any of the three subs sustained the kind of damage that would be expected from a collision. However, Popov, along with other supporters of the collision theory, complained that the U.S. refused to let the Russians inspect the subs.Other evidence contradicts Popov’s and similar claims. The Blacknest seismic monitoring station based in Berkshire, U.K., picked up the double explosion aboard the Kursk on the day of the disaster. It detected no sound of a collision prior to the first distinct explosion. Other seismologists backed those findings.What is more, a similar incident occurred on the HMS Sidon, a Royal Navy sub, in 1955, due to the same cause -- the ignition of a torpedo’s High Test Peroxide (HTP). Only in the Kursk’s case, the HTP fire managed to set off several live torpedoes.A salvage operation that Russia conducted with the help of Dutch companies may have made it impossible to verify the collision theory. The Kursk’s torpedo section was detached from the rest of the wreckage, which was refloated. Citing a potential danger to fishing vessels and other craft, the remains of the torpedo section were then destroyed.The crew of the Kursk nuclear submarine lines up on the vessel's deck, June 30, 2000, before the training exercise during which the accidental explosion occurred.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov weighed in on the renewed controversy on November 22, backing the government’s official version of what happened to the Kursk. ""[There are] no comments,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted him as saying. “You know that there was a probe. The investigation made its final conclusion, and therefore we do not want to comment on the emergence of any other theories here.”";https://www.rferl.org/a/kursk-disaster-putin-turning-point-russia/27184505.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/05/kursk.russia,http://www.geotimes.org/feb01/kursk.html,https://tass.com/politics/1364593;Russian Admiral Re-Floats Kursk Sub Conspiracy Amid NATO Tensions;;;;;;
132;;;;False;Jo Nova;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-indonesia-ivermectin-covid-surge/6743201.html;No Proof Ivermectin Cut COVID-19 Surge in Indonesia;2021-11-23;polygraph;;On November 11, Principia Scientific International, a U.K.-based organization with a history of spreading COVID-19 related disinformation, published an article claiming ivermectin had massively reduced coronavirus infection rates in Indonesia.The article, headlined: “Ivermectin Cuts Indonesia Covid By 98%, Aussie Cases UP 500% With Lock-N-Vax,” stated that ivermectin “was hot property in Indonesia, even if it was banned.” That ban, it said, led to a spike in cases, “wherein 90,000 people died in the following surge.”The claim that COVID-19 cases surged in Indonesia after it banned ivermectin is false. Ivermectin was not banned in Indonesia. Rather, the BPOM did not approve emergency and/or off-license use of the drug to treat COVID-19. BPOM, citing the World Health Organization and other health bodies, stated that “ivermectin for COVID-19 indications is only used within the framework of clinical trials,” which were approved on June 28. Still, the drug was available for its intended use as an anti-parasitic. The BPOM reportedly granted the state-run pharmaceutical company Indofarma permission to distribute ivermectin on June 22. The Jakarta Globe quoted State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir as saying ivermectin “is for therapies, not a cure for Covid-19.”Thohir said clinical trials for ivermectin were needed, adding it is a prescription-only medicine to be taken under a doctor’s supervision. Principia Scientific International claimed that the Food and Drugs Authority of Indonesia (BPOM) approved ivermectin for emergency use to treat COVID-19.That, it said, drastically cut Indonesia’s COVID-19 surge. By contrast, the article claimed that Australia’s “lockdown-and-vax plan and the roadmap to freedom doesn’t seem to be working too well.”“In Australia billions of dollars were burnt at the stake, not to mention the health risks of using experimental prophylactics, while Indonesia reduced Covid cases by 98% for about point-one percent of the cost and the main side effects were the deaths of worms, lice and bed bugs,” the article stated.However, the article, which has been posted repeatedly on social media, is riddled with unverified claims, if not outright falsehoods. At no point did it cite any peer review research proving that ivermectin, and not other containment measures, led to a drop in COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. In July, Indonesia — the world’s fourth most populous nation — experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases and is often described as the new epicenter of the global pandemic. That surge began to subside in September. Principia Scientific International has not provided evidence showing that ivermectin use caused the decline in cases.Principia Scientific International also repeated the false claim that the BPOM approved ivermectin for emergency use to treat COVID-19 on July 15.Jakarta-based Harsen Laboratories fell afoul of the BPOM for allegedly importing the drug illegally and telling the public it could be purchased without a doctor’s prescription or supervision. One of Harsen Laboratories owners also got in hot water for handing out free samples of ivermectin to “charitable groups” prior to receiving a license to manufacture and sell the drug, Asia Times reported. The Diplomat reported that Harsen Laboratories is suspected of lobbying high-ranking government officials to secure ivermectin’s approval as a COVID-19 drug. Some Indonesian Cabinet officials even falsely claimed that the BPOM authorized ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment in June. That, along with other public endorsements by prominent figures, likely led to increased off-label use.France 24 reported on July 8 that a run on ivermectin in Indonesia drove up prices as many pharmacies ran out of the drug.However, there is no peer reviewed data on who was actually taking ivermectin, and what, if any, effect it had on COVID-19. A healthcare worker wearing personal protective equipment carries an oxygen tube outside the emergency ward of a government hospital amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bekasi on June 25, 2021.Likewise, the perceived uptick in ivermectin use also corresponds to other public health measures to tackle the surge in COVID-19 cases. Only 5% of Indonesia’s population was fully vaccinated as of July 1.As cases skyrocketed, Indonesia ramped up its mass vaccination campaign. The country also instituted various measures to curb COVID-19’s spread.World Bank officials noted in a September 17 blog post that Indonesia was “administering over 1.2 million [COVID-19 vaccine] doses a day, nearly a 10-fold increase since mid-May 2021.”And while Indonesia, unlike Australia, did not institute a nationwide lockdown, it did implement a two-week lockdown covering 12 of the country’s 34 provinces and 55% of its population, Reuters reported.Indonesia implemented other measures. Employees of non-essential businesses were asked to work from home, shopping malls were closed, capacity limits were placed on restaurants, places of worship and public transport, and foreigners were largely banned from entering or transiting the country.Indonesians also became more willing to abide by the mask mandate.According to Statistica, 76% of Indonesian respondents said they wore face masks when going out in public as of October 25, versus 54% on February 24, 2020.Meantime, studies on ivermectin’s use as a treatment for COVID-19 have been inconclusive.In October, British researchers reported they found that many studies touting ivermectin’s benefits as a COVID-19 treatment were largely of “poor quality,” if not outright “fraudulent.”A number of studies touting ivermectin’s benefits have been retracted due to shoddy data and other concerns. An Institute for Clinical Research Malaysia study released earlier this month found that ivermectin did not have a significant impact in treating COVID-19.That study found adverse events (“most commonly diarrhea”) were three times more likely for those taking ivermectin than for those who received treatment without ivermectin.;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/30/who-advises-people-continue-wearing-masks/4314055001/,https://www.pom.go.id/new/view/more/pers/616/Penggunaan-dan-Pengawasan-Peredaran-Ivermectin.html,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/29/c_1310032799.htm,https://jakartaglobe.id/news/ivermectin-is-not-a-cure-for-covid19-minister/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/asia/indonesia-covid.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/16/indonesia-covid-wave,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-57838033,https://asiatimes.com/2021/07/indonesia-jumps-the-gun-on-ivermectin-as-covid-cure/,https://thediplomat.com/2021/08/an-anti-expertise-anti-science-attitude-is-undermining-indonesias-pandemic-response/,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210708-indonesians-ignore-warnings-in-rush-to-buy-anti-parasite-drug-for-covid,https://www.thejakartapost.com/paper/2021/07/09/prices-jump-for-unproven-covid-19-drug-ivermectin.html,https://ycharts.com/indicators/indonesia_coronavirus_full_vaccination_rate,https://blogs.worldbank.org/eastasiapacific/indonesia-has-passed-100-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-what-can-we-learn,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-looked-india-lockdown-didnt-adopt-its-policy-2021-07-02/,https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/369346/indonesia-authorities-extend-social-restrictions-through-august-27-update-31,https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/329546/indonesia-authorities-mandate-wearing-masks-in-public-april-5-update-11,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1110979/indonesia-wearing-masks-during-covid-19-outbreak/,https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1003006/v1/9360e8a1-08c6-425b-bcff-d2e3f22c1be5.pdf?c=1635183887,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0885066620973585,https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2021/11/742461/moh-study-does-not-recommend-ivermectin-covid-19-treatment,https://outbreaknewstoday.com/ivermectin-does-not-reduce-risk-of-severe-illness-from-covid-19-malaysia-study-50379/;No Proof Ivermectin Cut COVID-19 Surge in Indonesia;;;;;;
133;;;;False;Xie Zhenhua;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-china-power-crunch-coal-reliance/6743199.html;China Falsely Attributes Blackouts to ‘Seriousness’ About Climate;2021-11-18;polygraph;;On November 2, Xie Zhenhua, China’s special envoy on climate change, was asked about China’s recent string of power plant shutdowns, triggered by record-high coal prices, and whether they could accelerate plans to invest in renewable energy sources.Starting in late September, electricity shortages swept across half of China’s provinces, forcing factories, stores and households to ration electricity and in some cases causing blackouts.Xie, then attending the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, said the shortages were a result of coal-fired power plants reducing electricity supplies.Delegates talk during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 13, 2021. (REUTERS/Yves Herman)He added that as the price of coal rose because of China’s post-pandemic economic recovery, electricity prices remained unchanged due to government policy. As a result, many coal-fired power plants produced less electricity to avoid losing money.That is all true. But then Xie said:“If you look at the story (China’s power shortage) from another perspective, it's a reflection of Chinese effort and seriousness to adjust our energy structure and limit the use of coal. These problems may be associated with some one-size-for-all policy adopted by the local government, but actually, I think it also can be regarded as a reflection of our seriousness and determination to apply more renewable energy and reduce the consumption of coal.”That is false. In fact, China has been ramping up coal production to address the power shortages.Smoke and steam rise from towers at a coal-fired power plant in Xinjiang, April 21, 2021. (AP/Mark Schiefelbein)According to data released on November 16 by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the country produced 360 million tons of coal in October, a six-year record high. It did so despite having promised at COP26 to phase down coal and phase out the use of all fossil fuels. The world leaders at COP26 billed a new climate deal as the “death knell” for coal power.China, which already produces and burns more coal than all other countries combined, ordered coal mines to produce 220 million metric tons of extra coal a year to reverse the shortages.China’s National Development and Reform Commission demanded that all coal mines increase output as much as possible in the final quarter of 2021 and prohibited coal mines from being shut down.China has also increased coal imports and approved new coal projects, purchasing 26.9 million tons of coal in October, up 96.2% from a year ago, according to Wind Information, a Chinese financial data and information company. Citing Greenpeace, Reuters reported in late August that China’s provinces planned new coal projects producing over 100 gigawatts of energy.“The immediate cause [of the electricity crisis] is that China is still highly dependent on coal,” wrote Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Coal-fired power plants account for more than 70% of electricity generation in China.“Efforts to reduce coal *demand* would not lead to a shortage of *supply*,” Myllyvirta tweeted in response to Xie’s attempt to reframe the power crunch.China’s coal shortage was caused by its government’s efforts to boost energy-intensive industries to recover from the COVID-19 economic contraction, said Myllyvirta. Those efforts included mandating low electricity prices despite the surge in coal prices.Despite Beijing’s boast of a “green recovery,” energy-intensive construction and heavy industry have played an outsized role in China’s initial economic recovery, sparking an 11% increase in demand for coal during the first half of 2021. Growing global demand for Chinese goods further intensified electricity demands in the world’s largest manufacturing hub.Myllyvirta noted the role of Chinese market intervention. “Regulated power prices are intended to shield electricity users from price risks — a subsidy that comes at the expense of those who generate the power,” he wrote.“As I keep emphasizing, pro-coal interests in China have been extremely successful in spinning the false narrative that the coal and power shortage was caused by climate or clean energy policies, even if facts and logic show otherwise.”As nations negotiated the Glasgow Climate Pact at the close of COP26 on November 13, delegates from China and India made a last-minute demand to water down language on reducing coal use, insisting that the wording “phase out unabated coal” be changed to “phase down unabated coal.”Alok Sharma, president of COP26, said the following day that both countries “are going to have to explain themselves to the most climate vulnerable countries in the world.”;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-power-crunch-begins-weigh-economic-outlook-2021-09-27/,https://pekingnology.substack.com/p/transcript-chinese-climate-envoys,http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202111/t20211116_1824587.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/johnson-says-climate-deal-death-knell-for-coal-power-/6313392.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/energy-environment/china-coal-climate.html,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/business/china-coal-production-intl-hnk/index.html,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/chinas-coal-imports-in-october-nearly-doubled-from-a-year-ago.html,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-provinces-still-planning-over-100-gw-new-coal-projects-greenpeace-2021-08-25/?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing&utm_content=20210825&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20Daily,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/07/china-energy-crisis-electricity-coal-pricing-renewables/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/china-s-dirty-recovery-will-make-curbing-climate-change-tougher,http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-07/29/content_5628083.htm,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/07/china-energy-crisis-electricity-coal-pricing-renewables/;China Falsely Attributes Blackouts to ‘Seriousness’ About Climate;;;;;;
134;;;;False;Xi Jinping;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-biden-xi-started-war/6743198.html;Xi Falsely Claims China Never Started a War or Took 'One Inch of Land’;2021-11-18;polygraph;;"On November 15, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a one-on-one virtual summit, their first such meeting since Biden took office in January.Several issues for potential bilateral cooperation were on the agenda, including climate change, arms control and human rights.One pressing item was the status of Taiwan.Biden, who had earlier told reporters that Taiwan was “independent,” clarified that the United States continued to support the one-China policy, which recognizes the Chinese Communist Party as China’s government.However, the United States does not endorse the One China Principle, which views Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.Xi, for his part, said Taiwan’s attempts to get U.S. support for independence is “playing with fire.”In October, China dispatched a record number of jets into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, prompting Taiwan’s foreign minister to say his country is ready for war.Still, according to China Global Television Network (CGTN), Xi touted China’s peaceful intentions in speaking with Biden.“Xi said the Chinese people have always loved and valued peace, adding that aggression or hegemony is not in the blood of the Chinese nation,” CGTN reported.“Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has never started a single war or conflict, and has never taken one inch of land from other countries,” CGTN cited Xi as saying. “The country has no intention to sell its own development path around the world.”It is false to claim that China has never started a war or taken an inch of land from other countries.As Polygraph.info previously reported, the People’s Republic of China has invaded Vietnam and India. Tens of thousands of people were killed during its invasion of Vietnam in 1979.Intermittent fighting continued until 1991, with China occupying Vietnamese territory.In 1974, China seized the Vietnamese-controlled part of the Paracel Island chain, and captured six Spratly Island reefs from Vietnam in 1988. Both island chains are in the South China Sea.Soldiers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy patrol Woody Island in the Paracel archipelago on January 29, 2016.Evidence has surfaced raising doubts about Beijing’s claims that it has maintained some form of dominion over the Paracel and Spratly Islands since antiquity.In 1962, three years after China invaded Tibet, China also instigated a war with India along their disputed Himalayan border.During that conflict, China consolidated control over Aksai Chin — the eastern part of the Kashmir region, which India continues to claim.Beijing incited another Himalayan border war with India in 1967, with hostilities recommencing last year after decades of relative calm.China has built settlements in territory claimed by India, a move that some analysts say is changing the status quo along the Line of Actual Control separating Chinese from Indian territory.As Polygraph.info previously noted, the era of Tibetan independence from 1911 to 1951 was ended after China’s People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet in October 1950.More recently, China has made sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea.In 2009, China claimed it had “indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters” and “sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof.”In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague partially rebuked those claims. However, Beijing has ignored that ruling.China has not only seized islands and reefs from Vietnam, but also captured the Scarborough Shoal, some 137 miles east of the Philippines’ island of Luzon.In 1994, China seized Mischief Reef, an atoll 250 kilometers west of the Philippines' Palwan Island. China also maintains an illegal blockade of the Second Thomas Shoal, near Mischief Reef.On November 16, China’s coast guard blocked a resupply mission to a small Philippines military outpost on Second Thomas Shoal, which falls within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone (EEC).In 2016, The Hague tribunal ruled that Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal are actually part of the Philippines’ continental shelf.Still, Beijing has militarized Mischief Reef and built an artificial island on it.Image showing land reclamation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands by China in the South China Sea on May 11, 2015. (Associated Press)China has also had dozens of “Maritime Militia” ships “moored, anchored and stationary at Julian Felipe Reef,” in the Spratly Islands, which also fall within the Philippines EEZ, Radio Free Asia reported in March. (Radio Free Asia is a sister news organization of the Voice of America.)That fits into broader Chinese efforts to maintain dominance in the South China Sea through building military outposts on the Paracel and Spratly islands, and deploying anti-ship cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air missiles.Japan has accused China of stepping up efforts to assert its dominance in the East China Sea, particularly around the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.On November 13, Japan's new foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had assured him that the U.S. commitment to “defending Japan,” including the Senkaku Islands, was ""unwavering,” Reuters reported.";https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-and-xi-meet-in-historic-virtual-summit-/6314912.html,https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2021-11-15/xi-biden,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/581863-biden-seeks-to-clarify-remarks-on-taiwan-one-china-policy,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-one-china-policy-principle/31499875.html,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/nuclear-weapons-taiwan-and-other-key-issues-addressed-on-biden-xi-call,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-taiwan-china-air-space/31496290.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-vietnam-bully-1979-war/31564748.html,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2186515/veterans-chinas-war-vietnam-say-they-are-too-afraid-remember,https://www.britannica.com/place/Paracel-Islands,https://www.britannica.com/place/Spratly-Islands,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-paracel-islands-history-vietnam/31484544.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-india-galwan-clash/30990671.html,https://thediplomat.com/2021/11/did-china-create-new-facts-on-the-ground-along-the-lac-with-india/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-tibet-1951-liberation/31273424.html,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2009re_mys_vnm_e.pdf,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-07/12/content_26061326.htm,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/11/18/2142158/china-coast-guard-blocked-water-cannoned-philippine-boats-en-route-ayungin-dfa,https://www.philstar.com/news-commentary/2016/07/13/1602470/how-hague-court-ruled-philippiness-15-arguments,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mischief-reef-south-china-sea/31454450.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/demand-03312021154924.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-expansionism-south-china-sea/31217558.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-foreign-minister-says-blinken-gave-us-commitment-defend-japan-2021-11-13/;Xi Falsely Claims China Never Started a War or Took 'One Inch of Land’;;;;;;
135;;;;Likely true;Catherine Smallwood;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-covid-turkmenistan/6743188.html;Why Turkmenistan’s COVID Stats Are Likely Fabricated;2021-11-09;polygraph;;"Turkmenistan, an authoritarian Central Asian republic, has reported no COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. The World Health Organization’s pandemic dashboard indicates that there have been zero COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations or deaths in Turkmenistan.The WHO database relies on information provided by national health authorities. The WHO expects that information to be accurate, as each country is legally bound to implement the body of International Health Regulations adopted in 1969.Until recently, WHO officials refrained from publicly questioning Turkmenistan’s official data. On November 9, however, WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood told BBC News that it is doubtful that a country could have remained free of a virus while it “has been spreading worldwide as a pandemic for almost two years now.”“From the scientific point of view, it's unlikely that the virus is not circulating in Turkmenistan,” Smallwood said.Smallwood is most likely correct. News stories and other secondhand reports suggest that Turkmenistan hasn’t escaped the pandemic. They include reports that the country keeps a second set of COVID-19 statistics under wraps.In July 2020, Kemal Uckun, a 57-year-old Turkish diplomat, died in Turkmenistan after a brief illness. Turkish authorities later confirmed that he died from COVID-19. Authorities in Turkmenistan denied the diagnosis. (Turkmenistan’s President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and his regime are known for making very little information public.)In December 2020, Uckun’s widow, Guzide, sued Turkey’s foreign ministry, saying the country failed to evacuate her husband from Turkmenistan for treatment. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) quoted a Turkish embassy official as saying that, “Turkmen officials refused to allow a Turkish plane to come to Turkmenistan to transport Uckun home because they did not want the world to know that coronavirus was in their country.”(Editor’s note: RFE/RL is a sister U.S. government-funded news agency to VOA.)In September, Turkmen human rights and civilian union groups wrote to the WHO stating that “[a]lmost all foreign diplomatic representations in Turkmenistan temporarily suspended work and stopped receiving citizens in person, which is indirect confirmation that coronavirus is widespread in the country.”The letter urged the WHO to call on Turkmenistan to enact public safety protocols and allow independent COVID testing.“According to reports from numerous sources, hospitals are overflown in the capital and the regions,” the letter said. “We are convinced that the number of deaths from COVID-19 is far higher, but it is not possible to confirm the cause of death as coronavirus, as relatives and health workers are afraid to share information.”Health authorities in Turkmenistan have compiled a secret COVID database indicating some 25,000 deaths in the country from the virus, RFE/RL’s Turkmen service reported in October. The real numbers are likely much higher, because “regional health workers were downplaying the scale of the pandemic,” a source in the Turkmen health ministry told RFE/RL.The U.S. embassy in Turkmenistan said that it “has received reports of local citizens with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 undergoing COVID-19 testing and being placed in quarantine in infectious diseases hospitals.”However, “Turkmenistan has not officially acknowledged any cases of COVID-19 within its borders and may be disinclined to do so if cases were confirmed,” the embassy said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans avoid travel to Turkmenistan. “Because the current situation in Turkmenistan is unknown, even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants,” the CDC warned.When the BBC asked Smallwood whether Turkmenistan was providing false data to the WHO, she refrained from a direct answer, saying it is important to build a dialogue with Turkmen authorities rather than “make statements that may not in fact lead to the type of actions that we would want to see.”According to the WHO, Turkmenistan had administered some 7.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses as of last August. The country’s population is about 6.2 million.In November Turkmenistan extended quarantine-like measures first imposed in August. The authorities provided no explanation for the restrictions, which included closing restaurants and street markets.“The bodies of those who have died of COVID-19-like lung diseases were being delivered to their relatives in special plastic bags, and the number of fresh graves across the country was increasing exponentially,” the RFE/RL Turkmen service reported.The word ""coronavirus"" has been banned in Turkmenistan, and removed from the public vocabulary, Reporters Without Borders reported in April 2020. The website of Turkmenistan’s health ministry does not mention COVID-19 but recommends “wearing masks over nose and mouth, keeping a two-meter distance from each other in public places and following personal hygiene” – for “health improvement.”In July 2020, the health ministry said people needed to wear masks to protect themselves from a “high concentration of dust in the air.”";https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/tm,https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations#tab=tab_1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59168540,https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/global/turkmenistan-covid-activists-poke-holes-in-countrys-zerocovid-claims/news-story/4e6adbf9174ec2e38f2202118ae2ac47,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58583212,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/getting-covid-in-a-land-where-no-cases-officially-exist/ar-AAOASj5,https://tdh.gov.tm/tk,https://www.rferl.org/a/31011891.html,https://www.usagm.gov/,https://en.turkmen.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Letter-to-WHO.pdf,https://en.turkmen.news/news/open-letter-to-world-health-organization/,https://www.rferl.org/a/turkmenistan-covid-deaths-secret/31510878.html,https://tm.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-unknown/coronavirus-turkmenistan,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59168540,https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/tm,https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/turkmenistan-population/,https://www.rferl.org/a/turkmenistan-extends-covid-lockdown/31539940.html,https://abcnews.go.com/International/turkmenistan-bans-word-coronavirus-report/story?id=69914073,https://www.saglykhm.gov.tm/bildirislerlist,https://www.news18.com/news/world/insisting-the-country-is-coronavirus-free-turkmenistan-orders-mask-wearing-to-combat-dust-2713867.html;Why Turkmenistan’s COVID Stats Are Likely Fabricated;;;;;;
136;;;;False;Wang Wenbin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-hk-national-security-law-foreign-business/6743186.html;Foreign Businesses in Hong Kong are not ‘More Stable’ Thanks to National Security Law;2021-11-07;polygraph;;On November 1, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin was asked to comment on the decreasing number of U.S. companies with regional hubs in Hong Kong and whether Hong Kong’s sweeping National Security Law is causing reputational harm.Census and Statistics Department data released on October 28 showed that 254 U.S. companies had regional headquarters in Hong Kong as of June – a 10% drop from 2020 and the lowest number since 2003, when 242 U.S. companies were there.Wang said a January survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong showed “that in January 2021, a much larger proportion of companies are optimistic about the business environment in Hong Kong compared to August 2020.”“Since the implementation of the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR, U.S. and other foreign investors have enjoyed a safer, more stable and predictable business environment,” he said.A view from a tram window shows shipping containers at a port in Hong Kong, November 5, 2021. (AP/Kin Cheung)Trouble is, Wang misrepresented the survey, and the claim of a better business climate is false.In fact, multiple American Chamber of Commerce surveys, including the one cited by Wang, showed that U.S. businesses are cautious about the risks in Hong Kong. The surveys also make clear that the National Security Law has been the driving force behind such caution.In the chamber’s 2021 Business Outlook Survey, conducted at the start of the year, 40% of its 181 respondents said they expected the business environment “to remain unstable or worsen,” while a third of the respondents said Hong Kong had “become less competitive as an international business hub.”Although pessimism about the business environment decreased in January compared to the chamber's August 2020 survey, it still remained high.In that 2020 poll, which followed the new security law’s rollout, “75% reported feeling pessimistic about Hong Kong’s business prospects in general.” In the January 2021 poll, more than 61% of the respondents said they thought Hong Kong’s business environment was unstable and had worsened in the preceding 12 months.“Many pointed out the protests, the National Security Law (NSL) and COVID disruptions as their main concerns,” the survey summarized. “Some say the way the NSL was implemented and the ambiguity of its provisions have caused significant uncertainties. Though protests have stopped, the NSL has destabilized HK’s legal framework, according to some companies.”In a more recent chamber survey, conducted May 5-9 with 325 business members responding, 42% of the respondents said they were considering or planning to move away from Hong Kong, with “the most widely shared concern” being “discomfort due to the National Security Law.”Beijing imposed the sweeping legislation in June 2020 and has since reduced the city’s overall freedoms and quashed free speech and independent news media.Press freedom advocates rally outside a court in Hong Kong, Thursday, April 22, 2021. (AP/Kin Cheung)The national security law criminalizes “secession,” “subversion,” “terrorism” and “collusion with foreign forces,” with punishment up to life imprisonment. Amnesty International said in July 2020 that the offenses were “dangerously vague and broad,” adding that “virtually anything could be deemed a threat to ‘national security’ under its provisions, and it can apply to anyone on the planet.”Aside from targeting pro-democracy activists, politicians and lawyers in Hong Kong, the law poses a direct threat to foreign firms, legal experts say.First, the law has broad extraterritorial reach. Under Articles 37 and 38, permanent and nonpermanent residents of Hong Kong and companies can be prosecuted for documents, work or activities outside Hong Kong deemed to “endanger” China’s national security.“This could include receiving information about meetings if they fall within a key industry, purchasing documents that later become classified as state secrets, or hosting a website or server outside Hong Kong that contains content that violates the HK NSL,” wrote Dennis Kwok, former legislative councilor of Hong Kong, and Elizabeth Donkervoort, program director for East Asia at the American Bar Association, in July.“Similarly, given the breadth of industries subject to national security concerns by the PRC [People’s Republic of China], disputed intellectual property claims over a piece of technology could amount to national security or state secrets,” their report stated.Thomas Kellogg, executive director of Georgetown Center for Asian Law, co-wrote in Foreign Policy in July that Article 43 of the law is a key concern for private companies. That provision gives national security authorities in Hong Kong sweeping powers “to engage in search, seizure, freezing of assets, and online censorship of those accused of violating the law.”As investigations and prosecutions in the name of national security intensify, the Hong Kong government could ask companies to turn over information about customers, to censor their online speech, or to freeze their bank accounts.Moreover, rules for prosecuting Article 43 expanded the national security authorities’ investigative powers and slashed due process and privacy protections for the accused.Article 43 has been put to use.In January, Hong Kong police cited Article 43 to force the city’s major telecom provider, Hong Kong Broadband Network, to block access to HKChronicles, an anti-government website.In May, Hong Kong police cited Article 43 to order an Israeli software company, Wix, which operated outside of Hong Kong, to disable a pro-democracy website linked to Nathan Law, a Hong Kong pro-democracy dissident and former legislator.The company initially complied despite Law’s objections. Law, who took refuge in the UK, was told that the company was acting on police orders and could be prosecuted. The company eventually restored the website and apologized after Law shared the company’s response on Twitter.Kellogg cautioned that the reputational cost would be significant for any company to assist Hong Kong government’s crackdown on rights.On July 16, the U.S. departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security jointly warned U.S. businesses in Hong Kong of the “potential reputational, regulatory, financial, and … legal risks associated with their Hong Kong operations.”The advisory warned U.S. businesses in Hong Kong that they are subject to the security law, under which foreign nationals, including one U.S. citizen, have been arrested.;https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=133#,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/u-s-firms-with-hong-kong-headquarters-hits-18-year-low,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1918261.shtml,https://www.amcham.org.hk/sites/default/files/content-files/Survey/2021%20Business%20Outlook%20Survey%20Result%20-%20Final.pdf,https://www.amcham.org.hk/news/some-four-10-amcham-members-considering-leaving-hong-kong-over-national-security-law-fears,https://www.amcham.org.hk/sites/default/files/content-files/Survey/202105%20AmCham%20Survey%20-%20Should%20I%20Stay%20or%20Should%20I%20Go%20-%20FINAL_1.pdf,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_hong-kong-reels-after-one-year-national-security-law-imposed-china/6207752.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/hong-kong-national-security-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/,https://www.voanews.com/a/east-asia-pacific_voa-news-china_national-security-law-seen-threatening-hong-kongs-financial-role/6209847.html,https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/01/in-full-english-translation-of-the-hong-kong-national-security-law/,https://ash.harvard.edu/files/ash/files/the_risks_for_international_business_under_the_hong_kong_national_security_law_7.7.21.pdf?m=1626968393,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/26/hong-kong-risky-international-business-national-security-law/,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/06/P2020070600784.htm,https://hongkongfp.com/2021/01/14/hong-kong-broadband-network-admits-it-blocked-website-under-national-security-law/,https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3135963/hong-kong-national-security-law-used-briefly-shut-down,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HKBA-FOR-FINAL-RELEASE-16-JUL-21.pdf;Foreign Businesses in Hong Kong are not ‘More Stable’ Thanks to National Security Law;;;;;;

The IRGC then staged a maritime operation against the second vessel, landing its helicopters on its deck and navigating the ship towards Iranian waters.” The Press TV report was accompanied by a dramatic, nearly seven-minute-long video.Yet the Press TV report was false: The only act of piracy, it turns out, was carried out by Iran.The oil export monitoring service Tanker Trackers Inc. monitored the incident as it unfolded and provided a summary based on data about the Sothys’ activities. (It should be noted that Tanker Trackers said the hijacking took place on October 24, not October 25.) According to Tanker Trackers, the Sothys departed from the Middle East in June of this year, bound for Longkou, China, with 700,000 barrels of Iranian oil. It is believed the Sothys loaded the oil from a Liberian-flagged vessel called the Oman Pride. In August, the U.S. Treasury Department had levied sanctions on the Oman Pride and its owners’ company for alleged involvement in smuggling Iranian oil to Asia. Yet, the ship was never confiscated or seized by the U.S. forces, and the sanctions came after the transfer of oil took place in June.Once the Sothys reached the Chinese port, for unknown reasons it sat for six weeks without unloading. But the tanker then returned to Bandar Abbas in Iran, where it remains. Vietnamese officials have reportedly been in contact with Iran to negotiate the ship’s return. Meanwhile, on November 4, the Iranian oil carried by the Sothys was reportedly offloaded to an Iranian-flagged vessel in Bandar Abbas.The New York Times reported that IRGC-linked social media accounts claimed the Sothys was one of four ships confiscated by the U.S. in the Atlantic while en route to Venezuela last August.However, reports at the time said those vessels, all of which were identified, were sailing under the Liberian flag.On November 3, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby denied that the U.S. tried to intervene in the IRGC’s operation to seize the ship.“I've seen the Iranian claims they are absolutely totally false and untrue,” Kirby told reporters. “There was no such effort by U.S. naval assets to seize anything. What this refers to is back on the 24th of October, U.S. Navy assets did monitor Iranian forces, illegally boarding and seizing a merchant vessel in international waters in the Gulf of Oman.” In the Iranian video, none of the U.S. vessels are seen attempting to intervene. There is audio of a dialogue between the IRGC operatives and one of the U.S. destroyers. When warned to stay away, a voice says in English: “This is a coalition warship conducting routine operations in international waters.”Although Iranian speedboats can be seen very close to the American vessels, the video does not show any aggressive maneuvering by the latter.Iran has established a pattern for attacks on oil tankers, including boarding and seizing ships. Earlier this year, Polygraph.info reported on an attempt by Iranian forces to hijack a cargo ship called the Asphalt Princess. A small group of armed men boarded her and demanded that the crew head to a port in Iran.Earlier, IRGC units harassed a ship owned by the same Dubai-based company. As in the Sothys incident, the Iranian commandos cruised alongside the ship with armed speedboats while a helicopter landed a squad on the ship’s deck. In January, a South Korean ship was hijacked to an Iranian port and held until South Korea agreed to release $1 billion in Korean bank accounts frozen under sanctions. And in July 2020, another ship was hijacked near the United Arab Emirates and later found in Iranian waters.;https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:726619/mmsi:574005200/imo:9253064/vessel:SOTHYS,https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:704461/mmsi:636020000/imo:9153525/vessel:OMAN_PRIDE#:~:text=OMAN%20PRIDE%20(IMO%3A%209153525),her%20width%20is%2060%20meters.,https://www.reuters.com/article/vietnam-iran-tanker-trackers/vietnam-tanker-seized-by-iran-seen-transferring-cargo-tankertrackers-idUKS8N2RE025?edition-redirect=uk,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/world/middleeast/iran-tanker-oil.html,https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2020/30629/4-iranian-tankers-seized-usa-largest-seizure-histo/,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42987/video-shows-u-s-destroyers-very-intimate-standoff-with-iranian-vessels-over-seized-oil-tanker,https://www.polygraph.info/a/iran-s-false-false-flag-claim-on-ship-attack/31403178.html;Iran Blatantly Lies to Cover Up an Act of Piracy;;;;;;
138;;;;False;RT (Russia Today)/ Brendan Heard;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-confederate-monuments/6743184.html;Moving Confederate Statues Isn’t Like Destroying Ancient Palmyra;2021-11-05;polygraph;;"On October 29, the Russian government-owned agency RT (formerly Russia Today) published an op-ed on the removal of monuments associated with slavery and racism in the United States.The RT contributor, Brendan Heard, focused his piece on a proposal that the African American Heritage Center in Virginia submitted to the Charlottesville, Virginia, city council. The center suggested that a bronze statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee be melted down and used to create a piece of art.Heard equated the running controversy over statues of Confederate figures in the U.S. with the wanton destruction that Islamic State terrorists caused in Syria.“Melting statues to create modern art is a sign America hates its own history & no different from ISIS destroying Palmyra,” Heard wrote.That claim is false. In fact, they are quite different.“It is absurd to compare a proposal raised for discussion in a democratic process to ISIS's violent and authoritarian occupation and destruction of monuments at Palmyra,” Virginia Herrmann, an archeologist with the Institute for Ancient Near Eastern Studies at the University of Tubingen in Germany, told Polygraph.info.“Context and process are meaningful when it comes to engagement with monuments, and this comparison ignores both,” Herrmann said.Workers remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, after years of a legal battle over the contentious monument, in Charlottesville, Virginia, July 10, 2021. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)Monuments to Lee, the rebel military leader in the U.S. Civil War, and other Confederate leaders have become controversial. Many see them as symbols glorifying racism, slavery and oppression, while others celebrate them as tributes to the heritage of the American South.African-American and progressive activists advocated for the removal of Lee monuments and other Confederate relics across the country as part of a campaign for historical justice, and to condemn racism and recognize the contribution of African slaves to America’s prosperity.The debate over Confederate symbols has been going on for decades, engaging activists, intellectuals, celebrities, politicians and government officials. Beyond moving statutes, it has involved renaming highways as well as counties, cities, streets, schools and colleges.“Monuments are sites of power contestation, of memory politics. The monument-maker has the resources and authority to impose on public spaces their view of who and what is to be celebrated or condemned,” Herrmann and archeologist Giuliana Paradiso wrote in an essay.The controversy around Confederate symbols escalated in 2020, when protests erupted across the country after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who had been pinned to the ground with a neck chokehold by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.Some 168 Confederate symbols were removed across the United States in 2020 alone, more than all previous years combined, Statista reported.White supremacists stand behind their shields at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, August 12, 2017. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)At times, the controversy has escalated to violence, as in 2017, when scores of white supremacists and right-wing activists gathered in Charlottesville. A 32-year-old woman was killed and about 40 were injured during the clashes between nationalists and Black and anti-racism activists. Two police officers died in a helicopter crash while patrolling the events.As of June 2021, 170 Confederate monuments had been removed across the United States, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported. Still, more than 700 Confederate monuments remain in public spaces across the country, the SPLC said.Most of the relics were relocated to museums or temporary locations. Discussion of what to do with them is ongoing, and melting them down to create new art is just one suggested option. Others include keeping them in museums for display in the context of historical racism.Herrmann argues that the monuments are not themselves history, but “public value statements about that past.”“The memory of Lee and his role in the Civil War is not threatened by this proposal” to re-cast the Charlottesville statue anew, she said.An image made available by propaganda Islamist media outlet Welayat Halab on July 2, 2015 allegedly shows an Islamic State fighter destroying ancient artifacts smuggled from the Syrian city of Palmyra. (AFP)In Iraq and Syria, Islamic State terrorists destroyed numerous ancient sites and artifacts that the United Nations had designated as world heritage relics of outstanding universal value.Among them was Palmyra, described by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as “[a]n oasis in the Syrian desert, north-east of Damascus, Palmyra contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world.”UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova described the damage to Palmyra as “a new war crime and an immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity.”“This new blow against cultural heritage, just a few hours after UNESCO received reports about mass executions in the theatre, shows that cultural cleansing led by violent extremists is seeking to destroy both human lives and historical monuments to deprive the Syrian people of its past and its future,” Bokova said.Mbaraz Ahmed, a senior analyst at Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, wrote in September 2015 that there were several reasons for Islamic State’s destruction of historic relics. Among them was the group’s Salafi ideology, which emphasizes “monotheism (Tawhid) and eradicating any form of association with God (Shirk or polytheism),” Ahmed wrote.Another was Islamic State’s sectarianism. “Sites belonging to Shia, Kurdish, Yezidi and Christian communities have been subjected to destruction and looting,” Ahmed wrote. “The clear message is that they are now irrelevant; the cultural and ethnic legacies of these people have no place in the ‘caliphate.’”UNESCO described the damage to Palmyra as “a new war crime and an immense loss for the Syrian people and for humanity.”Islamic State also sought to make money. According to a UNESCO estimate, Islamic State looted artifacts worth more than $2 billion to be smuggled and sold in shadow markets.“The destruction wreaked by ISIS is an attack on the shared history of human civilization, and as such is just as much an affront to Muslims as it is to the rest of the world,” Ahmed wrote.Russia has its own history of destroying monuments and symbols.Following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet authorities erased public displays of Russia’s imperial past, including Orthodox Churches and other religious symbols.After Soviet dictator Josef Stalin died in 1953, thousands of Stalin statues were removed. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, statues of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky were removed, as were other communist symbols.MOSCOW, USSR. -- The demolition of the Felix Dzerzhinsky monument on August 23, 1991.

A clip that has gained traction on social media includes excerpts from an interview that Melissa Strickler, a former quality assurance and quality control manager at Pfizer, gave to LifeSiteNews, a “pro-life” news website that has previously spread COVID-19 disinformation.Earlier, Strickler falsely claimed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19 may contain fetal cells.In the interview, Strickler claimed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine “glows.” She added that the only components which could make the vaccine glow “are SM-102, which is called Luciferase, and graphene oxide.”When asked to describe what she means by glows, Strickler replied: “[I]t looks like someone took a blue glow stick, cracked it open, and poured it in the vial,” adding that it “only glows if there’s light and if it’s around a dark surrounding.” Emerald Robinson, the White House correspondent for Newsmax, was among those who retweeted the clip, rhetorically asking her Twitter followers: “Dear Christians: why would you inject something with LUCIFERASE into your body?”The implication, of course, is that there is a connection between luciferase and Lucifer (the devil). The claim that the Pfizer vaccine contains any ingredients that make it glow in the dark is false. Attempts to connect the vaccine to the enzyme luciferase are intended to stoke fears connected to the end-time beliefs held by some Christian denominations. First, Comirnaty, the trade name for the COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, does not contain SM-102 or graphene oxide.A full list of the vaccine ingredients is available on the Food and Drug Administration website. Those ingredients include salts used to maintain the acidic balance in your body, and sugar, which healthcare experts say helps the vaccine’s molecules maintain their shape during the freezing process. Comirnaty also contains lipids, fatty molecules that do not dissolve in water. They are used in lipid nanoparticle delivery systems, which help bring the fragile mRNA into the target cells.SM-102 is not among the lipids used in Comirnaty.The Moderna vaccine does contain SM-102. However, Strickler was incorrect to say SM-102 “is called Luciferase.”SM-102 is a “proprietary ionizable lipid” that Moderna made for its vaccine. A medical staff member prepares the Moderna coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine to be administered at the newly-opened mass vaccination center in Tokyo, Japan, on May 24, 2021. (Carl Court/Reuters)SM-102 is combined with other lipids to form lipid nanoparticles (very tiny pieces of matter made of lipids that do not dissolve in water). Studies have found SM-102 to be ""optimal for the intramuscular administration of vaccines.”Luciferase refers to a group of enzymes that produce bioluminescence. Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. Bioluminescence occurs when livings things produce and emit light, as commonly seen in fireflies.French pharmacologist Raphael Dubois first coined the term luciferase while conducting experiments on bioluminescence in the 19th century.According to Nebraska Medicine, a research partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, “SM-102 is sometimes mixed with chemicals that aren’t meant for human consumption” when used for purposes other than medicine. For example, SM-102, which contains luciferase-encoding mRNA, can be used for non-invasive monitoring of cells.A man receives a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a vaccination centre in Kyiv, Ukraine on October 27, 2021. (Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters)Virologists have also used luciferase to develop better diagnostic tests for COVID-19. But vaccine manufacturers did not put the enzyme in any COVID-19 vaccine. Previous conspiracy theories involving SM-102 have deceptively used the warning label for chloroform when describing SM-102 to make people think it is hazardous to their health. Likewise, no World Health Organization-approved vaccine contains graphene oxide, a compound of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen that is used in some biomedical applications that may be toxic.According to Health Desk, an initiative of the technology non-profit Meedan, the ingredients of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were tested by outside parties and “not found to contain any graphene oxide in their formulas, including their lipid nanoparticles.”This is not the first attempt to link COVID-19 vaccines to end-time conspiracy theories. Luciferase sounds similar to Lucifer, a name which some Christians interpret to refer to the devil. However, Lucifer literally means light bringer/bearer in Latin.Many medical terms come from Greek or Latin. Luciferase is derived from the Latin words for “light” (lux) and to bring/carry (ferre). In any case, attempts to tie the COVID-19 vaccines to satanic plots, and/or to imply that they contain ingredients hazardous to human health, are false. Yet Robinson has attempted to spread that very fear. In a now-deleted tweet, she falsely claimed: “Dear Christians: the vaccines contain a bioluminescent marker called LUCIFERASE so that you can be tracked. Read the last book of the New Testament to see how this ends.”Robinson has also spread the Great Reset conspiracy, which posits that a global elite is using the COVID-19 pandemic to dismantle the United States, the system of capitalism, and American society. Polygraph.info reached out to Newsmax to determine if Robinson’s repeated false claims violated their social media policy or code of ethics. Newsmax has not responded.Update: In a statement to Business Insider published on November 4, Newsmax said it had taken Robinson off of the air pending a review of her social media posts. A network spokesperson said her off-air ""duties for the network"" would continue during that review process.";https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/20/10-facts-about-americans-and-coronavirus-vaccines/ft_21-03-18_vaccinefacts/,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/sins-omission,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-social-media-b0c5633662b18765458d7abfe9203708,https://www.fda.gov/media/151707/download,https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2021/01/11/a-simple-breakdown-of-the-ingredients-in-the-covid-vaccines/,https://cen.acs.org/business/outsourcing/Lipids-unsung-COVID-19-vaccine/99/web/2021/02,https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/057137238/publication/WO2017049245A2?q=pn%3DWO2017049245,https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf#page=12,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/65/htm,http://photobiology.info/HistBiolum/HistBiolum.html,https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/sm-102-moderna-vaccine,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq1067,https://www.tmc.edu/news/2020/07/fireflies-help-kindle-new-tests-and-treatments-for-covid-19/#single-article-body,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-vaccine-ingredient-sm-102-is-safe/,https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y,https://health-desk.org/articles/how-do-we-know-graphene-oxide-isn-t-used-in-covid-19-mrna-vaccines,http://www.cultus.hk/Latin_vocab/noun3/lux.html,https://emeralddb3.substack.com/p/the-great-reset-the-plan,https://www.businessinsider.com/newsmax-personality-emerald-robinson-taken-off-air-covid-vaccine-tweet-2021-11?fbclid=IwAR1C3qDbcF9z4nT4GopdfbsdTogZ__CT9SOiIRn2L-jFOukEQG2aVF5lDI4;Wild Conspiracy Theory Linking Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine To ‘Lucifer’ Goes Viral;;;;;;
140;;;;False;Moeun Chhean Nariddh and Son Minea;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-cambodia-paris-peace-agreement/6743174.html;Cambodia: After 30 Years, a Promise of Democracy Still Broken;2021-10-25;polygraph;;"On October 23, Cambodia commemorated the 30-year anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords (PPA), which marked the official conclusion of the Cambodian-Vietnamese War.The agreement was also heralded as bringing about the official end of Cambodia’s long civil war, though some have disputed that idea.On the eve of the anniversary, about 20 women married to jailed politicians protested outside the French Embassy in Phnom Penh. As they called on authorities to respect the agreement, police responded harshly.At another rally outside Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., some 200 participants called on Prime Minister Hun Sen to respect the peace agreement. Those demonstrators also asked the U.S. Congress to sanction Hun Sen’s government.Still, some within Cambodia claim the commitments of the agreement have been realized — that includes the pro-government Khmer Times newspaper.“Some 30 years later, government officials, scholars and ordinary Cambodians have looked back and expressed their views about how the spirit of the PPA has been fulfilled and translated into actions to ensure peace and democracy in Cambodia,” the newspaper claimed.It cited government spokesman Phay Siphan, who asserted that peace has been maintained “under the wise leadership of (Prime Minister Hun Sen).”“In other words, we have given power to the people, but not in a way to encourage people to demonstrate and curse the government on the streets,” Phay Siphan said.That leaves a false impression, however, because the agreement’s promises of pluralism and true democracy are not the reality in Cambodia today.True, the agreement largely marked the end to decades of conflict. But under Hun Sen, human rights commitments in the PPA have languished.The Paris Peace Agreements addressed both the content of Cambodia’s constitution and how it would be drafted. Annex Five, “Principles for a New Constitution for Cambodia,” says:“The constitution will state that Cambodia will follow a system of liberal democracy, on the basis of pluralism. It will provide for periodic and genuine elections.“It will provide for the right to vote and to be elected by universal and equal suffrage. It will provide for voting by secret ballot, with a requirement that electoral procedures provide a full and fair opportunity to organize and participate in the electoral process.”General elections conducted under the auspices of the United Nations were carried out in 1993. The run-up to that vote was fraught with political violence.Still, 20 political parties participated, the elections were held in line with the constitution and the United Nations endorsed the results.In analysis for the BBC in 2018, Kevin Ponniah wrote that after rejecting the election results, Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) would manage “to strong-arm their way into a coalition government, using the pretext of a secessionist movement in the east of the country.”After a shaky coalition government formed, Hun Sen ousted his coalition partner in what is sometimes described as the 1997 Cambodian coup d’état.His CPP would win elections the following year and never lose an election again.In 2017 local elections, the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) captured approximately 44% of the vote, despite conditions deemed “hostile to free speech and genuine political participation” by New-York based Human Rights Watch.Soon thereafter, CNRP leader Kem Sokha was arrested on treason charges, while the Supreme Court of Cambodia ruled to dissolve the CNRP in November 2017, effectively leaving Cambodia a one-party state and in conflict with the PPA.""Dissolving the CNRP is against the Peace Accord’s democracy pillar, which is more or less an international peace treaty,” Sorpong Peou, a professor in the politics and public administration at Toronto’s Ryerson University, told Al Jazeera.The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said Kem Sokha’s prosecution had “clearly resulted from the exercise of his right to take part in the government of his country” and his right to “freedom of expression and opinion,” in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the PPA called on Cambodia to uphold.Charles Santiago, chairperson of the Parliamentarians for Human Rights at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, called the dissolution of the CNRP “the final nail in the coffin for Cambodian democracy.”Mass arrests and violence against CNRP members followed. And with virtually no opposition, the CCP won a landslide in parliamentary elections of July 2018.The country’s high court has become a rubber stamp, “widely known to be under the control of Hun Sen,” according to the United Kingdom’s Guardian newspaper.A 2020 U.S. State Department report echoed the theme, stating that the “constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but the government did not respect judicial independence, exerting extensive control over the courts.”Regarding the courts and their role as a venue to protect ordinary Cambodians, the State Department found “there was impunity for government officials and family members for human rights abuses.”Regular assaults on those affiliated with the CNRP go unpunished — the same for environmental and labor activists, who face regular persecution.Earlier this month, U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet expressed deep concern over “the impunity for attacks against political activists and human rights defenders” in Cambodia.She noted a deterioration of civil and democratic space in the country, with a newly enacted COVID-19 law “leading to the curtailment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”Local and international rights groups have routinely reported on abuses, including a raft of measures to curtail free speech online and off.In September, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Cambodia Democracy Act of 2021, which “directs the President (Joe Biden) to impose sanctions on individuals responsible for acts to undermine democracy in Cambodia, including acts that constituted serious human rights violations.”U.S. Congressman Alan Lowenthal tied that bill to Cambodia’s failures to live up to its commitments under the PPA.“Despite repeated actions taken by both the United States and the international community, the authoritarian regime of Prime Minister Hun Sen continues to reject the democratic promises and processes he agreed to in the 1991 Paris Peace Accords,” Lowenthal said.“From shuttering or co-opting the free press, to banishing political opponents, to eliminating free and fair elections and then repeatedly declaring himself the people’s choice, the Hun Sen regime continues to do everything in its power to destroy any hope of democracy in Cambodia,” he said.";https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national-politics/paris-peace-agreements-turn-30-pm-reflects,https://thediplomat.com/2021/10/dancing-to-different-tunes-cambodias-false-peace/,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/world/wave-of-violence-threatens-election-in-cambodia.html,https://theconversation.com/cambodia-heads-towards-one-party-state-and-a-democratic-crisis-85515,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_840,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44966916,https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/12/cambodia-commune-elections-not-free-or-fair#,https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-supreme-court-dissolves-cnrp/4117996.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/23/cambodias-democratic-dream-in-shreds-30-years-after-paris-accord,https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/Opinions/Session81/A_HRC_WGAD_2018_9.pdf,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national-post-depth-politics/live-blog-supreme-court-rules-dissolve-cnrp,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/29/cambodia-hun-sen-re-elected-in-landslide-victory-after-brutal-crackdown,https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/cambodia/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/attacks-07122021185719.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/06/cambodia-assault-on-environmental-defenders-escalates-as-four-more-charged-imprisonment/,https://www.workersrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WRC-Report-Crackdown-in-Cambodia-3.24.14.pdf,https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-repression-in-cambodia-is-stifling-fundamental-freedoms/6261640.html,https://mailchi.mp/9bb87c501f69/cchr-october-2021-newsletter?e=a68103286b&fbclid=IwAR252r9WHccsC_qGKVtnP_Zs1xMxEsPim3EPdKV7uhFCseKM8Bqej6anpyc,https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/cambodia#,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-rong-chhun-conviction-incitement/31424610.html,https://lowenthal.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressmen-lowenthal-applauds-bipartisan-passage-bill-imposing-sanctions;Cambodia: After 30 Years, a Promise of Democracy Still Broken;;;;;;
141;;;;False;Oleg Deripaska;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-deripaska-fbi-search/6743173.html;Details Oleg Deripaska Forgot to Mention After FBI Raid;2021-10-22;polygraph;;"On October 19, the FBI searched two houses linked to the Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska in New York and Washington, D.C. The raids were part of an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, multiple news reports said.In the U.S., Deripaska has been best known as a person of interest in the investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, and for his ties with Paul Manafort, who served as campaign chairman for Donald Trump, the winner of that election.The FBI and the Southern District attorney's office provided no details about the purpose of the raid. Deripaska suggested in a Telegram post, however, that the searches were related to Russian campaign interference.Among other things, Deripaska accused the FBI of ""appropriating two bottles of vodka"" and blasted the U.S. for ""conveniently feeding the electorate with all sorts of crap."" ""Watching everything that is happening in America, I cannot help but marvel at the utter stupidity of part of the American establishment who persist in spinning this story about the allegedly colossal role of the Russians in the 2016 U.S. presidential election."" That is false. In fact, U.S. investigations unearthed a multilevel Russian influence operation that aimed to foster mistrust in the government system and civil instability. Evidence showed that Russia backed Trump in 2016 and again agitated to keep him in office in the 2020 election. The special counsel investigation into Russian interference in 2016, led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, determined that Manafort had instructed a longtime employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, to deliver polling data that Manafort hoped would end up with Deripaska. The FBI suspected Kilimnik, who formerly ran Manafort's office in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, of ties to Russian intelligence, according to Mueller's final investigative report. In the mid-2000s, Deripaska reportedly had a $10 million annual contract with Manafort for lobbying in Washington. But the two eventually came at odds, with Deripaska suing Manafort for $28 million in damages, allegedly for mishandling millions in investment funds. By 2016, according to the Mueller investigation, ""Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a 'disagreement' — a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits.""While documenting the apparent intent, the Mueller report concedes that investigators could not find a link between sharing of polling data and Russian interference in the election. Nor did it establish any other coordination between Manafort and Russian election meddling. Nonetheless, an expansive 2020 report into Russian interference conducted by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee found that ""Manafort's presence on the (Trump) Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over and acquire confidential information on, the Trump campaign."" The committee's report goes on: ""The Committee found that Deripaska conducts influence operations, frequently in countries where he has a significant economic interest. The Russian government coordinates with and directs Deripaska on many of his influence operations. ""From approximately 2004 to 2009, Manafort implemented these influence operations on behalf of Deripaska, including a broad, multimillion dollar political influence campaign directed at numerous countries of interest to Deripaska and the Russian government. ""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign in March 2016 and continuing throughout his time on the Campaign, Manafort directly and indirectly communicated with Kilimnik, Deripaska, and the pro-Russian oligarchs in Ukraine. On numerous occasions, Manafort sought to secretly share internal Campaign information with Kilimnik. ""After the election, Manafort continued to coordinate with Russian persons, particularly Kilimnik and other individuals close to Deripaska, in an effort to undertake activities on their behalf. Manafort worked with Kilimnik starting in 2016 on narratives that sought to undermine evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election."" Deripaska, a multibillionaire industrialist, has denied ever receiving campaign information. Over the years, he has also denied a torrent of other accusations involving his business activities. In February 2020, the Financial Times reported on a U.S. Treasury Department document that accused Deripaska of past money laundering on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the time, Deripaska called the Treasury allegations ""unsupported"" and ""balderdash."" In April 2018, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Deripaska and his companies, among others, for aiding ""malign activities,"" namely, Russia's occupation of Crimea, inciting war in Eastern Ukraine, violence against civilians in Syria and global cyberattacks. The Treasury stated in a press release: ""Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. ""Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group."" Deripaska fought the sanctions by suing the Treasury Department, claiming it ruined his reputation and cost his businesses billions in losses. The sanctions were lifted a year later in a deal with the Trump administration. In 2007, the U.S. revoked Deripaska's multientry visa granted in 2005. The State Department declined to state the reasons for the entry ban, but The Wall Street Journal, citing law enforcement sources, said the revocation involved suspicions about possible ties to Russian organized crime.In one business dispute that ended up in court, Deripaska claimed to have been forced into a protection racket as he built his anchor business in aluminum in the late 1990s.Before leaving office, Trump issued a pardon to Manafort, who had been sentenced to prison for bank fraud, filing false tax returns and failing to report offshore accounts. Prosecutors claimed Manafort had laundered $30 million in profits from his lobbying work in Ukraine.";https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-fbi-raid.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/world/europe/mueller-trump-russia-deripaska.html,https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idPmeO?now=true,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/russian-tycoon-deripaska-blasts-fbi-raids-properties-2021-10-20/,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN25E2OY,https://www.justsecurity.org/54340/shades-grey-russian-ops-violate-international-law/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/,https://news.yahoo.com/us-putin-approved-operations-help-042350081.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/24/manaforts-russia-connection-what-you-need-to-know-about-oleg-deripaska/,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/analysis-the-role-russian-businessmen-played-in-the-mueller-report,https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download,https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf,https://www.forbes.com/profile/oleg-deripaska/?sh=19a454bd804c,https://www.ft.com/content/20b95b2c-4e6e-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5,https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/news/ofac-cites-claims-that-oleg-deripaska-laundered-money-for-putin-ft/,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-announcement-idUSKCN1HD1O0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/sanctions-deripaska.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1143738620070511,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-oligarchs-lawsuits-idUSL6E8IBCIF20120711,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/23/trump-pardons-former-campaign-chairman-paul-manafort-and-other-allies/6468531002/,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/21/17648760/manafort-trial-guilty-verdict-mueller-trump-russia;Details Oleg Deripaska Forgot to Mention After FBI Raid;;;;;;

Severely sick patients began overwhelming many hospitals. And President Vladimir Putin ordered Russians to take a week off work to stave off the surge in cases nationwide.Ironically, Russia was the first country to announce a COVID-19 vaccine, known as Sputnik V, in August 2020. But one year after the vaccine’s rollout, which had Putin’s backing, only 19 percent of the population had been fully vaccinated with the two required doses. The figure now stands at only about 35 percent.Research shows a high rate of vaccine hesitancy in Russia. Although the motives vary greatly, one factor is mistrust in the government.Putin may be partly to blame. He touted Sputnik V at the release as being safe and effective even though large-scale clinical trials hadn't begun. His claims met skepticism from some Russian medical authorities who urged Russia’s Ministry of Health to revoke Sputnik V’s registration until after the large trials could be completed. Responding to the news of record daily deaths and low vaccination rates, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the persistence of vaccine hesitancy. But he denied that it was tied to Sputnik V or any specific vaccine.“This vaccinophobia, which some citizens have, is not related to vaccine brands at all,” he said.Peskov’s statement is misleading.In addition to the early Russian skepticism, Sputnik V has yet to gain full international acceptance despite evidence suggesting it is safe and effective.The World Health Organization recently suspended the approval process for Sputnik V, citing a lack of data. The United States and European Union have not yet approved Sputnik V for use.Independent polling among Russians has shown great resistance to vaccination regardless of brand. In March, Reuters reported more than 60 percent of Russians in a Levada Center survey said they didn’t want Sputnik V. Most cited side effects as the reason. About 64 percent said they thought the coronavirus was made as a bioweapon. By comparison, the Levada Center found that 69 percent of Russian doctors and medical specialists trusted Sputnik V as safe and effective. There are a few other vaccinophobia factors to consider. First, Russians have not had much choice. Authorities had earlier stopped foreign vaccine imports. A campaign in state-sponsored media also cast doubt on the efficacy and safety of foreign vaccines, particularly those from the U.S. Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration and the U.K.’s AstraZeneca.There is evidence that Russians who can afford to do so are traveling outside to acquire Western vaccines. The Associated Press reported that Russians have been making trips to Serbia, a non-European Union country, to get the Pfizer-BioNTech shots and others. Russian travel agencies arranged vaccine package tours. Some Russians interviewed said they wanted a foreign vaccine to be able to travel more widely.About 50 countries are now open to travelers inoculated with approved vaccines, though not all approved vaccines are accepted in some countries. That and other inconsistent policies have created confusion for travelers, The New York Times reported.Writing in July for Foreign Policy, Alexey Kovalev, investigative editor at the independent Russian publication Meduza, said the government simply blew its COVID-19 response.“Despite having access to the brain power and resources of one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world, Russian authorities have repeatedly squandered almost every chance to beat the pandemic,” Kovalev said.“Their massive, bloated propaganda apparatus failed to do the one job it was designed for: Get the message out. Instead, the pandemic has exacerbated the crisis of trust between the Russian government and citizens.”;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/10/19/russia-reports-new-record-high-coronavirus-deaths-a75336,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00277-2/fulltext,https://theconversation.com/making-sense-of-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-in-russia-lessons-from-the-past-and-present-165716,https://www.polygraph.info/a/skepticism-not-sour-grapes-defines-west-s-reaction-to-sputnik-v/30792379.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/13/who-says-approval-for-russias-sputnik-v-vaccine-still-on-hold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/27/us-travellers-sputnik-russia/,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-europe-russia-pandemics-1ca0650bf5ec7b404e2490c107a40dc2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-poll/over-60-of-russians-dont-want-sputnik-v-vaccine-see-coronavirus-as-biological-weapon-reuters-poll-idUSKBN2AT2XK,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/09/30/western-coronavirus-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-russia-kommersant-a75173,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-intelligence-coronavirus-disinformation/31146031.html,https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-russia-travel-serbia-sputnik-v-02aa2bc49d00299493aa46c1af5e15a2,https://www.afar.com/magazine/travelers-with-covid-vaccines-can-visit-these-countries,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/travel/travel-vaccine.html,https://meduza.io/en/episodes/2021/06/04/a-russian-ad-agency-s-war-on-the-pfizer-vaccine;Putin’s Flack Misleads on Russian Vaccine Phobia;;;;;;

The report insinuated that the vaccine was more harmful than COVID-19.“In Taiwan, the number of people dying after their COVID-19 vaccination is exceeding the number of deaths from the virus itself,” said the reporter, Tiffany Meier.“Taiwan’s health authorities say that as of Monday (October 11), deaths after vaccination reached 865. While deaths from the virus are 845.”The report includes a screen capture from Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control, which it claims shows 652 COVID-19 deaths after the AstraZeneca vaccine; 184 after the Moderna vaccine; 26 after Taiwan’s domestically developed Medigen vaccine; and three after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The implication that vaccines might kill more people than COVID-19 is false. The report leaves out important context, is mathematically naïve and ignores abundant scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective.With the exception of a spike in cases from late April, Taiwan has been a global leader in taking public health measures that largely contained the disease. The confirmed number of COVID-19 cases and related deaths is very low, especially when compared with the number of people who have been vaccinated.A medical worker administers a dose of the domestically developed Medigen vaccine against COVID-19 at a vaccination site in Taipei on August 23, 2021. (Annabelle Chih/Reuters)For starters, the numbers cited in the New Tang report aren’t reliable. They come from a system set up by Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that merely gathers unverified reports of potential side effects caused by vaccines.Taiwan’s Vaccine Adverse Event Notification System (VAERS), where the CDC data used in the report comes from, does not provide information on deaths related to vaccines. The CDC notes important caveats:“The reported events occur after vaccination, but that does not indicate that they are caused by vaccination. … The number of adverse event notifications alone cannot explain or be used to draw conclusions on the existence, severity, frequency or incidence rate of vaccine-related problems, and they should be explained in the context of other scientific information.”In short, the system’s self-selected reports make them suspect until someone can investigate whether there is a true link between vaccination and an adverse event.The system does not report deaths that are proved to be from vaccination.Autopsies have repeatedly shown those who died after vaccination were found to have succumbed to preexisting conditions or chronic diseases.Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen receives her second dose of the domestically developed Medigen Vaccine against COVID-19 in Taipei on September 30, 2021. (Ann Wang/Reuters)Next, the number of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in Taiwan is significantly greater than the number with confirmed COVID-19 cases. If vaccination was in fact more dangerous than COVID-19, then the number of post-vaccination deaths reported in VAERS should far exceed the number of deaths from COVID-19.According to Taiwan’s CDC, 16,343 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the country as of October 19. Confirmed deaths stood at 846.By contrast, 15.4 million of Taiwan’s 23.6 million citizens have received one vaccine dose, and nearly 6 million people have received both doses. Roughly 65 percent of Taiwan’s population is at least partially vaccinated, and 25 percent is fully vaccinated.Nonetheless, Robert Malone, an infectious-disease researcher and prominent anti-vaccine advocate who claimed to have invented the vaccine technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs, has seized on the misleading reports about vaccination deaths in Taiwan to argue “[v]accinating low-death-rate countries (such as much of Africa) will elicit more deaths from the jab than from disease.”Insinuating that the vaccines might be more dangerous for younger people than catching COVID-19, he suggests only vaccinating elders in Africa.That tweet has been retweeted nearly 12,000 times since October 12.Yet, data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than vaccinated people. Rates of infection and hospitalization were also shown to be significantly lower among the vaccinated.Many other factors are at play when it comes to a country or region’s ability to put a cap on COVID-19 infections.Taiwan’s relatively low infection rate and death count can be chalked up to its robust pandemic response and public health system. Taiwan’s single-payer, universal health care system has consistently ranked highly in global indices, with coverage provided to every citizen.Writing in the monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Immunology, Taiwan’s health minister said the “Taiwan model” for battling COVID-19 came from experience battling the 2003 SARS outbreak.He said that early implementation of quarantine for travelers, the wide availability (and acceptance of) face masks, and robust National Health Insurance (NHI) databases that aided contact tracing led to early success in containing the virus and helped avoid strenuous lockdowns seen elsewhere.However, with the emergence of COVID-19 variants (including the delta strain) in late April, Taiwan saw a spike in cases, partly because of vaccine shortages.Chunhuei Chi, director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University, noted that Taiwan had only 400,000 vaccine doses delivered before the April outbreak.Chi argues that one “barrier in vaccine procurement” faced only by Taiwan — “the China factor” — played a significant role.Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be a province, allegedly sought to thwart efforts by Taiwan to procure foreign vaccines. Taiwan, in turn, has refused to accept vaccines from Beijing.Infections spiked, pushing Taiwan into a semi-lockdown.Still, following new curbs, increased testing and compliance with other measures including mask mandates, Taiwan got the surge under control, reporting no new COVID-19 infections on August 15. Since then, the situation has been stable.Correction: A previous version of this article reported the wrong number for Taiwanese who had received one vaccine dose. The figure has been corrected to 15.4 million, or 65 percent of the population.";https://www.cdc.gov.tw/File/Get/grZJUmOnSvnWeAC1o9TAAA,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4234661,https://www.cdc.gov.tw/,https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations,http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960712/,https://international.thenewslens.com/article/104644,https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2021&displayColumn=3,https://freopp.org/taiwan-freopp-world-index-of-healthcare-innovation-69c3b3b17a46,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-00908-2,https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/08/13/taiwan-and-the-politics-of-vaccine-warfare/,https://fortune.com/2021/05/25/taiwan-covid-cases-vaccine-china-beijing-offer/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/business/taiwan-china-biontech-vaccine.html,https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20210613-covid-19-despite-a-surge-in-cases-taiwan-resists-china-s-vaccine-diplomacy,https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/why-taiwan-is-beating-covid-19-again/?fbclid=IwAR1NGMCOKBRZwE-TvCFQUKywK0qUFwOQaXQhYjAciXfsWwDIUScmIpk4-_0,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-reports-no-new-domestic-covid-19-cases-first-time-since-may-9-2021-08-25/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/with-cases-stabilising-taiwan-partially-ease-covid-19-curbs-2021-07-08/;Vaccines Are Not More Deadly Than COVID-19 in Taiwan;;;;;;
144;;;;Misleading;C.J. Pearson;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-powell-covid-vaccine/6743169.html;Colin Powell’s Death Does Not Undercut Coronavirus Vaccines;2021-10-19;polygraph;;On October 18, Powell’s family announced that the four-star general, and the first Black American to serve as secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had died from complications of COVID-19. Powell was fully vaccinated, however, and vaccine skeptics and conservative media personalities jumped on that fact to spread false or misleading claims and innuendo suggesting coronavirus vaccines don’t work, are dangerous and are just not what they’re cracked up to be. “Fox & Friends” host Will Cain suggested the government was hiding “the truth,” calling Powell a “very high-profile example” of the fact that the “fully vaccinated are dying from COVID.” And marquee Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Powell’s death proved that “you've been lied to.”Some of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s supporters, who as a group have significantly lower coronavirus vaccination rates in the country, joined in. One was C.J. Pearson, the founder of the conservative Free Thinker Project and student senator for the University of Alabama.Pearson, whose 375,000 Twitter followers include Eric Trump, suggested that Powell’s death exposes a news media bias favoring vaccines. “Will the media point out that Colin Powell died despite being fully vaccinated the same way they point out when people aren’t when they die?” Pearson asked. Thousands liked, and hundreds retweeted Pearson’s tweet. But it is misleading. Most responsible news outlets not only reported that Powell was vaccinated but included context about his complicating medical conditions — cancer and Parkinson’s disease — and correctly and honestly noted that vaccines aren’t a panacea and never were promised to be. “Powell, 84, had been treated over the past few years for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that impairs the body’s ability to fight infections — and to respond well to vaccines,” The Associated Press reported.CBS News cited a recent study in the medical journal Leukemia reporting that “55% of multiple myeloma patients failed to fully respond to COVID-19 vaccination, based on antibodies measured in their blood after two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.” The Daily Mail noted the Parkinson’s diagnosis. Powell’s age and medical history were “an unlucky confluence that gave him a perfect storm for being at severe risk, despite being fully vaccinated,” the outlet reported, citing Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the vaccines against COVID-19 are “not 100% effective at preventing infection,” and that “some people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19. These are also known as breakthrough cases.”As of October 12, the CDC reported 7,178 breakthrough deaths among more than 187 million Americans who had been fully vaccinated. In 85% of these deaths, the victims were over 65 and had underlying health conditions that complicated their cases.At the same time, unvaccinated people are six times as likely to become infected with COVID-19 and 11 times as likely to die from the disease, the CDC reported.The vaccines against COVID-19 are highly effective at minimizing the risk of infection, hospitalization and death, the CDC said, and booster shots are being administered to help those with weakened immune systems fight the new variants as the virus rapidly evolves. (Powell was due for a booster shot but had not yet received it when he became ill.)As to Pearson’s suggestion that news media might ignore Powell’s vaccination status? In fact, nearly every mainstream outlet reported upfront that he’d been fully vaccinated.;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/quote-box-powell-first-black-us-secretary-state-remembered-phenomenal-leader-2021-10-18/,https://www.thedailybeast.com/colin-powells-vaccinated-coronavirus-death-triggers-anti-vaxxer-frenzy,https://www.mediamatters.org/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-claims-colin-powells-death-proves-youve-been-lied-about-vaccine,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/09/23/under-60-of-americans-who-relied-on-trump-for-covid-info-are-vaccinated-poll-finds/?sh=42244bb375ad,https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1450107788315832320?s=20,https://apnews.com/article/colin-powell-age-cancer-covid-54ea91719144709554294f3a55d6aa30?utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/myeloma-may-have-made-colin-powell-more-vulnerable-to-dying-of-covid/ar-AAPFGJD,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10104403/Doctors-explain-fully-vaccinated-Colin-Powell-increased-risk-death-COVID-19.html,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness.html,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/powell-vaccine-skeptics/2021/10/19/a1679ddc-303b-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html,https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1450128286550409217?s=20,https://twitter.com/AP/status/1450077162493644812?s=20;Colin Powell’s Death Does Not Undercut Coronavirus Vaccines;;;;;;
145;;;;False;Eric Spracklen;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-project-veritas-pfizer-immunity/6743159.html;Project Veritas 'Sting' Spreads Vaccine Falsehoods;2021-10-08;polygraph;;"Update: Since this fact-check was published, the Associated Press has debunked another claim related to a Project Veritas video. The erroneous claim is that fetal cells may be in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19. That is false. Read AP's fact check here. On October 4, the right-wing activist group Project Veritas published a fourth video in what it says is a COVID-19 “investigative” series.The video includes what Veritas claims to be secretly filmed conversations with employees of the Pfizer drug company. The purported employees say that natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, provides stronger immunity than vaccination – an assertion that is not settled science.Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine are seen at a COVID-19 vaccination centre in Seoul, South Korea, on March 10, 2021.(Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters)Eric Spracklen, chief of staff at Project Veritas, posted several tweets:“BREAKING: @Pfizer Scientists: ‘Your [COVID] Antibodies are Probably Better than the [Pfizer] Vaccination’“We’re Like Bred And Taught to be Like “Vaccine is Safer Than Actually Getting Covid.”“Our Organization is Run on Covid Money Now”.They are accompanied by the hashtag “#ExposePfizer”However, the video, spliced in with highly emotive footage, is misleading. Moreover, the insinuation that natural immunity is better is disputed. Overall, Project Veritas presents a false choice that puts the vaccine hesitant in danger.In fact, studies on natural immunity versus vaccination are inconclusive. To be sure, there is a growing body of evidence that vaccination in combination with natural exposure might provide the greatest level of protection.But what Project Veritas fails to mention are the dire health consequences, including a higher likelihood of death, that unvaccinated individuals face when infected with COVID-19.Tiffany Jackson comforts her son Adrian James, 2, who tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as he breathes with assistance from a ventilator at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 5, 2021.The manipulative video includes comment from one individual identified as an “experienced biochemist at Pfizer.” The person tells the undercover Project Veritas reporter:“When somebody is naturally immune — like they got COVID — they probably have better, like not better, but more antibodies against the virus.”The individual goes on to state that natural exposure works better as the body starts “producing antibodies against multiple pieces of the virus.”“So, your antibodies are probably better at that point than the [COVID-19] vaccination,” this person states.That opinion is reinforced by two other individuals identified as Pfizer scientists. One says “you’re protected for longer” if you exposed to the virus naturally. “I work for an evil corporation … Our organization is run on COVID money.”The other purported scientist says: “We're bred and taught to be like, ‘vaccine is safer than actually getting COVID’ .”Polygraph.info has reached out to Pfizer to confirm that the three individuals in the video are actually employed at the company, and to clarify what, exactly, their work at the pharmaceutical giant entails.Pfizer did not respond in time for publication. Pfizer has yet to publicly comment on the video.Doses of the Pfizer coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine are seen at a mass vaccination site supported by the federal government at the Miami Dade College North Campus in Miami on March 10, 2021.Despite Project Veritas’ insinuation of a cover-up, the debate on natural immunity versus vaccination is hardly secret in the scientific community. Nor is the question settled. Contradictory evidence on the issue continues to be published.Writing for the Washington Post, Marty Makary, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted more than 15 studies have shown ""the power of"" naturally acquired immunity, with one study out of Washington University suggesting ""even a mild covid infection resulted in long-lasting immunity.""A large study conducted in Israel found that people who had previously been infected with COVID-19 “were much less likely than never-infected, vaccinated people to get Delta (the more contagious and deadly variant of the virus), develop symptoms from it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19,” the peer reviewed academic journal Science reported.Charlotte Thalin, a physician and researcher who studies the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, told Science that study is “a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination.”But Thalin warned that deliberate exposure to the virus would put the unvaccinated at risk of serious illness, death, and chronic symptoms from so-called “Long Covid,” or long-haul COVID, with symptoms that can last for weeks if not months.James Lawler, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Nebraska, contends the Israeli study was flawed. Its authors did not correct for survivorship bias (the exclusion of individuals who have died from a disease) or selection bias (when the sample population is not reflective of the overall population), Lawler said.Nebraska Medicine, which partners with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, argues that “natural immunity is not better” than vaccination.Nebraska Medicine points to a study published last month in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, which found that 36 percent of people who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 failed to develop antibodies.U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Delta variant of coronavirus on September 9, 2021.That study, however, was only conducted among 72 people.Nebraska Medicine also links to a study suggesting that natural immunity fades faster than vaccine immunity.Published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in November 2020, the study was conducted among 156 frontline U.S. health care personnel. It found that 60 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 93.6 percent people experienced a drop in levels. A full 28 percent tested negative for antibodies.Some studies show that vaccines also become less effective over time and against more potent strains of the coronavirus.A large Lancet study published on October 4 found that “effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections (including the Delta variant) dropped from 88 percent during the first full month after vaccination to 47 percent after five months.But the vaccine was 90 percent effective in preventing hospital admissions. The Lancet study was funded by Pfizer.Vaccination versus natural exposure is not an either/or proposition.Writing for Science, virologist Shane Crotty of California’s La Jolla Institute for Immunology argues that “[w]hen natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is combined with vaccine-generated immunity, a larger-than-expected immune response arises.”That phenomenon, which he says is borne out in multiple studies, is called “hybrid immunity.”A study published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in August looked at the benefits of natural exposure plus vaccination versus only natural exposure. It found that those who had not been vaccinated were 2.34 times more likely to get reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated.As to the risk of infection, various estimates show 86 percent to 98.6 percent of all hospitalizations in the United States for COVID-19 are unvaccinated people.Although the delta variant and decreasing vaccine efficacy have taken a toll, a study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September found that “rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were substantially higher in persons not fully vaccinated compared with those in fully vaccinated persons.""A CDC study released last month found that unvaccinated individuals are 11 times more likely to die than vaccinated individuals.Project Veritas has been accused of using deceptive practices, including selective editing, secret recordings and gotcha journalism, to discredit their targets.In “Network Propaganda Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics,” researchers at Harvard called Project Veritas a “right-wing disinformation outlet.”";https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-social-media-b0c5633662b18765458d7abfe9203708,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/15/natural-immunity-vaccine-mandate/,https://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html,https://echo360.org/media/df6327b6-1e39-401e-affb-5220eaedef8e/public,https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/covid-19-studies-natural-immunity-versus-vaccination,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042_article,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947a2.htm,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02183-8/fulltext,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj2258,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_w,https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/unvaccinated-covid-patients-cost-the-u-s-health-system-billions-of-dollars/,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm,https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-09-10/cdc-finds-unvaccinated-11-times-more-likely-to-die-of-covid,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MVRuDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP358#v=onepage&q=project%20veritas&f=false;Project Veritas 'Sting' Spreads Vaccine Falsehoods;;;;;;
146;;;;False;Robert Menendez;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-taiwan-china-air-space/6743157.html;Technically, China Did Not Invade Taiwan’s Airspace;2021-10-06;polygraph;;"On Monday, October 4, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense reported that 56 Chinese jets had flown into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).That doubled the previous single-day record, which occurred on June 15, when China dispatched 28 warplanes in the vicinity of Taiwan. That record itself was then repeatedly broken over several days – and the message underscored with threatening rhetoric.“China will take all measures necessary to crush any ‘Taiwan independence’,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Twitter.The continued flights followed a Group of Seven industrialized nations call for “the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues” between China and Taiwan, which the communist mainland views as a breakaway province.The tensions sparked a flurry of comments from U.S. politicians and media, with many claiming China had violated Taiwan’s airspace. Among them was Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.A Taiwan-built fighter jet releases flares during a drill simulating a Chinese invasion in Pingtung county on August 25, 2016. (Tyrone Siu/Reuters)“Incursions on Taiwan airspace are only the latest example of China's increasingly aggressive behavior,” Menendez tweeted.“With global stability & security at stake, it's more crucial than ever that the US defend democratic values & free-market principles championed by Taiwan's people & government.”Beijing’s intentions aside, however, it’s technically false to say China made incursions into Taiwan’s airspace.That’s because Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone (ADIZ) is not synonymous with its national airspace. In fact, they are quite different in both legal and geographical dimensions. According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which spells out the rules for international air travel, “every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory.”The convention notes that the territory of a state includes its territorial waters, which extend 12 nautical miles from the baseline (the low-water line along the coast) of a state. Sovereignty also extends to a country’s internal waters, which face landward from the baseline.An ADIZ is distinct from national airspace.The U.S.-based think tank Globalsecurity.org defines an ADIZ as a “unilaterally established set of procedures followed by one country's air defense forces” that are not underpinned by an international treaty or law.For example, states may demand that aircraft entering their ADIZ identify flight plans and nationality, keep their transponders on, and respond to radio identification requests.However, other states aren’t required to comply with these demands if they “are prepared to have their aircraft intercepted,” Globalsecurity.org wrote.Approximately 20 states have established ADIZs, including China, Japan, South Korea and the United States.A little-understood fact about Taiwan’s ADIZ is that it overlaps geographically with China, both its territorial waters and actual land. Moreover, China’s own ADIZ, declared in 2013, covers territories claimed by South Korea and Japan. For example, China’s ADIZ covers the Senkaku Islands, disputed by China and Japan.Due to the unilateral nature of ADIZs, portions of the buffer zones set up by China, Japan and South Korea overlap, specifically in the East China Sea.It was against this backdrop that China tested boundaries.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) mouthpiece the Global Times said on October 4 that the People’s Liberation Army had “for the third time in just four days … broke its record in the number of aircraft dispatched for drills near the island of Taiwan in a single day.”Citing Taiwan defense authorities, the Global Times reported that “[a]t least 149 PLA warplanes have joined exercises near the island of Taiwan since the start of the National Day” on October 1, the day that commemorates establishment of the People’s Republic of China.Those military aircraft included 34 J-16 fighter jets, two Russian-manufactured Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, two Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, two KJ-500 early warning aircraft and 12 H-6 nuclear-capable bombers.But while the Chinese aircraft flew between Taiwan and Taiwan-controlled Pratas Island, they never came within 100 miles of Taiwan.Many media outlets, including Fox News, NBC News, Sky News Australia News.com.au, Stars and Stripes and Deutsche Presse-Agentur tweeted that the Chinese planes had entered Taiwanese airspace.Besides Menendez, other U.S. politicians, including Republican House member William Gregory Steube and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also a Republican, repeated the incorrect claim.In response to China’s actions, Taiwan’s foreign minister said his country is ready for war, appealing to Western partners, specifically Australia, for aid.Tensions in the region have ratcheted up as China has increasingly attempted to assert its claims within the so-called “nine-dash line,” an arbitrarily imposed boundary that Beijing claims gives it control over most of the South China Sea. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan all have competing territorial claims in the region.The United States in recent years has used freedom of navigation operations to uphold “the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law.”Taiwan has been a particular flashpoint, with Beijing insisting that Taiwan is indisputably a part of China under the so-called ""One China Policy.""Historically, the United States has ""acknowledged,"" but not ""recognized,"" that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States does recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole government of China.No formal military alliance exists between the United States and Taiwan. However, under the Taiwan Relations Act, ""the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.""The ramped-up Chinese flights coincided with joint naval exercises involving the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Canada in the Philippine Sea near the Japanese Island of Okinawa, some 455 miles from Taiwan.Three aircraft carriers – two American and one British – were in the armada of 17 warships from six countries that trained together in the Philippine Sea.In September, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States announced the so-called AUKUS security pact, which entails the delivery of a nuclear-powered submarine fleet to Australia.That pact has raised the ire of China.";https://www.mnd.gov.tw/Publish.aspx?SelectStyle=即時軍事動態&p=79141&title=國防消息,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-sends-record-28-fighter-jets-taiwan-78288190,https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/32cb2229dbc8-urgent-g-7-to-call-for-peace-across-taiwan-strait-in-statement-source.html,https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_cons.pdf,https://theaviationist.com/2013/11/24/china-new-adiz/,https://www.wtva.com/content/national/575459792.html,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202110/1235639.shtml,https://twitter.com/foxnewsradio/status/1445195792017412096,https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1444705078284374019,https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/1445254091156824064,https://twitter.com/newscomauHQ/status/1444799429207150595,https://twitter.com/starsandstripes/status/1445507337918156800,https://twitter.com/dpa_intl/status/1443946150357241861,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-04/taiwan-preparing-for-war-with-china/100511294,https://www.c7f.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/2690119/7th-fleet-conducts-freedom-of-navigation-operation/#.YOvjAOKQnxQ.twitter,https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter,https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/taiwan-relations-act/,https://www.stripes.com/branches/navy/2021-10-04/aircraft-carriers-ronald-reagan-carl-vinson-queen-elizabeth-3120912.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-australia-us-france-submarine/31480403.html;Technically, China Did Not Invade Taiwan’s Airspace;;;;;;

The cache, leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, names world leaders, celebrities, judges, officials and business owners who hid their money offshore. Among them are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Reacting to the Pandora Papers revelations on her Telegram messenger channel, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote:“On June 4, 2021, US President Joe Biden announced the publication of a National Security Study Memorandum on the Fight Against Corruption to establish combatting corruption as a core US national security interest. That’s what he said. Today, according to The Guardian, the ICIJ investigation named the US as the largest tax haven."" In fact, Biden did the sign memo. But the claim attributed to the ICIJ is false, and Zakharova and Russian state media have ignored or played down the outsized proportion of Russian nationals and oligarchs represented in the offshore secrecy documents.The ICIJ did not name the U.S. as the largest “tax” haven, but rather as “one of the biggest players in the offshore [secrecy] world.” Other research suggests the U.S. is the world’s second-biggest tax haven – behind Cayman Islands and ahead of Switzerland.Zakharova leaves out one of biggest findings. “ICIJ’s analysis reveals that Russians are behind about 14% of the more than 27,000 companies whose ownership details are revealed by the leak,” the news outlet wrote in one article.“Among them, at least 46 Russian oligarchs were using offshore companies, the analysis found.” Those quotes were at the end of an ICIJ article detailing information about Konstantin Ernst, a former head of several Russian state media. The ICIJ story dubbed Ernst “Putin’s chief image-maker.”The billionaires named in the Pandora Papers “come from 45 countries, with the largest number from Russia (52), Brazil (15), the U.K. (13) and Israel (10),” the ICIJ reported.The fact that the U.S. has become one of the world’s largest “tax” havens is old news: Bloomberg reported it back in 2016. But the Pandora Papers are also about not just taxes, but hiding money in virtually impenetrable trust arrangements.Some of that hidden money is coming to the United States. The ICIJ and its partners report that the state of South Dakota, for instance, has become a favorite destination. At the same time, U.S. politicians, including Biden, have been upfront about the risks of money laundering. Moreover, they have taken action to combat it.Zakharova noted the Biden memo, officially titled “Memorandum on Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core United States National Security Interest,” signed and published online June 3. “Corruption threatens United States national security, economic equity, global anti-poverty and development efforts, and democracy itself,” the memo states. “My Administration will lead efforts to promote good governance; bring transparency to the United States and global financial systems; prevent and combat corruption at home and abroad; and make it increasingly difficult for corrupt actors to shield their activities.” The memo outlines a strategy of working with foreign partners, modernizing U.S. agencies that investigate laundering, and lifting secrecy about business ownership.When Biden took office, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption legislation had been gaining bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress In January 2021, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act, which requires all U.S. businesses to file ownership information with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The goal is to end anonymous shell corporations, a popular mechanism for tax evasion and concealing assets. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 was passed to support the provisions in the Corporate Transparency Act. Among other things, it makes it easier for U.S. justice officials to subpoena foreign financial records and provides rewards for whistleblowers who step forward to expose wrongdoing. Zakharova hasn't been the only one to ridicule Biden.In April, Swiss officials lambasted the U.S. president after he called the European country, known for its banking secrecy, a ""tax haven."" International regulators, the Swiss now say, have affirmed the country’s steps to meet international transparency standards.Others noted the irony of calls for transparency from a president who hails from the state of Delaware, with its history of business secrecy.“Delaware, the state that Biden represented in the Senate for 36 years, has long had a reputation for allowing companies and wealthy individuals to hide the true beneficiaries of anonymous shell companies registered there,” the Associated Press reported. Biden campaigned on cracking down on tax evasion and money laundering, however.The administration has asked for a major increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to help audit high earners. For years, budget cuts crippled the agency's ability to audit the finances of wealthier taxpayers. American billionaires like Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett, are not named in the Pandora Papers. More than 40 Russian oligarchs were named, however, as was the aforementioned Konstantin Ernst.Ernst was tasked with orchestrating the opening ceremonies for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, for which he was supposedly paid only one ruble. However, the ICIJ discovered that after the games, Ernst was cut in on a billion-dollar privatization deal that began with the incorporation of a company in the British Virgin Islands, a well-known international tax shelter. ""The leaked files also show that Ernst was the beneficiary of a $16.2 million loan – from a Cyprus bank partly owned by VTB – used to fund his stake in the deal,"" the ICIJ wrote. (VTB is a state-owned Russian bank.)""The files show the bank explicitly instructed offshore lawyers to keep documents detailing Ernst’s connection to the loan out of government records in the British Virgin Islands, where the shell companies concealing the deal were incorporated."" In responding to the ICIJ, Ernst denied that he ever concealed his involvement in the privatization deal and accused the organization of working for ""the U.S. secret services.""";https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/pandora-papers-biggest-ever-leak-of-offshore-data-exposes-financial-secrets-of-rich-and-powerful,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/global-investigation-tax-havens-offshore/,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-biggest-private-tax-havens/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/vladimir-putin-konstantin-ernst-russia-tv-offshore/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/global-investigation-tax-havens-offshore/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/the-world-s-favorite-new-tax-haven-is-the-united-states,https://thefactcoalition.org/landmark-bill-ending-anonymous-u-s-companies-is-enacted/,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/congress-passes-the-anti-money-9818694/,https://apnews.com/article/europe-switzerland-government-and-politics-business-d7b3049baf3a69df9750ba475066a83f,https://www.occrp.org/en/offshore-crime/delaware-the-onshore-offshore,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/economy/biden-american-families-plan.html,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/vladimir-putin-konstantin-ernst-russia-tv-offshore/;Russia's False Rebuttal of Pandora Papers Probe;;;;;;

If Meng adheres to its conditions, a U.S. criminal indictment against her could be dismissed in December 2022.Meng received a hero’s welcome upon returning to China, with her release framed as a diplomatic victory for the “strong motherland.”Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou waves upon arriving from Canada at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport, in Shenzhen on September 25, 2021. (CCTV via Reuters)“It has long been a fully proven fact that this is an incident of political persecution against a Chinese citizen, an act designed to hobble Chinese high-tech companies,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said upon Meng’s arrival in China on September 25.“The so-called ‘fraud' charges against Ms. Meng Wanzhou are purely fabricated,” Huashe said.That claim is false. While it ultimately is up to a court to determine guilt, the U.S. has put forward compelling evidence pointing to Meng’s complicity, including documents and a series of on-the-record incidents.Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou waves upon arriving from Canada at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport, in Shenzhen on September 25, 2021. (CCTV via Reuters)This evidence wasn’t “fabricated.” Huawei, meanwhile, has not made public evidence it says disproves the accusations against Meng and the company.First, some background.Canada’s arrest of Meng in 2018 at the request of the United States threw already rocky U.S.-China relations into a tailspin, with Ottawa caught in the middle. China imprisoned two Canadians on charges of espionage, which Canada and its allies decried as “hostage diplomacy.”The Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, were released just hours before Meng’s departure from Vancouver. Some Western media have framed the events as an “apparent prisoner swap.” Two U.S. citizens who'd been barred from leaving China also were subsequently sent home.Beijing and Washington deny the releases are connected. But Beijing has characterized Meng as a hostage in a U.S. plot to prevent China’s rise.Although Meng did not plead guilty, she did acknowledge the Justice Department’s Statement of Facts underpinning the fraud charges to be “true and accurate to the best of her information and belief.”That was one condition of the deferred prosecution deal.“In entering into the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution,” the DOJ said in a September 24 statement.The institution is HSBC, where both Huawei and Skycom, a Hong Kong shell company the U.S. maintains was controlled by Huawei, held bank accounts. HSBC conducted transactions in U.S. dollars for Huawei.The DOJ alleges Meng led HSBC to believe that Skycom was only a partner of the Chinese tech giant. Meng misled HSBC into approving millions of dollars in transactions with Skycom from 2010 to 2014 to support Skycom’s Iran business, in violation of U.S. sanctions, the agency alleged.That included at least $7.5 million in transactions to pay Iran-based contractors to work with Iranian telecommunications service providers.Reuters reported in December 2012 and January 2013 that Skycom’s Tehran office offered to sell embargoed U.S.-made computer gear to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator in late 2010. Reuters also unearthed documents showing Skycom’s close ties with Huawei.Huawei responded to Reuters that the deal did not go through and insisted that Skycom was just one of its “major local partners.”HSBC, along with other Western banks, questioned Huawei’s relationship with Skycom following Reuters’ findings. Huawei again stated that Skycom was its business partner in Iran.In August 2013, Meng made an in-person PowerPoint presentation to an HSBC senior executive in Hong Kong to address the Reuters reports.Meng stated, according to the DOJ, that Huawei’s relationship with Skycom was “normal business cooperation,” and reaffirmed Skycom as a “business partner of Huawei” and a “third party” that Huawei “works with” in Iran. Meng told the HSBC executive that Huawei, once a shareholder of Skycom, had “sold all its shares in Skycom.”The DOJ called Meng’s statements to HSBC untrue, saying that Huawei actually controlled Skycom.All significant Skycom business decisions were made by Huawei. Moreover, Skycom’s country manager – the head of the business – was a Huawei employee. Individuals employed by Skycom believed they worked for Huawei, the DOJ said.Skycom’s annual return, filed in May 2007, showed the company became wholly owned by Hua Ying Management Co Ltd. in February 2007, Reuters reported. According to Hua Ying’s filings, its shares were owned by Huawei’s parent company, Shenzhen Huawei Investment & Holding Co Ltd. The record also showed that Meng was then Hua Ying’s secretary.In November 2007, instead of selling “all its shares in Skycom,” Huawei transferred Skycom’s ownership to Canicula Holdings Ltd., a company which was also controlled by Huawei, the DOJ said.Skycom corporate records also showed that Meng served on its board of directors, which consisted of Huawei employees, between February 2008 and April 2009. As Reuters reported in 2013, several past and then current Skycom directors appeared to be Huawei employees. The individuals both had Huawei email addresses and were in Huawei’s employee directory.After receiving the English version of Meng’s PowerPoint presentation in Hong Kong, HSBC continued business with Huawei. The DOJ concluded that it was Meng’s misrepresentation of the nature of Huawei’s business in Iran that tricked HSBC into providing services to and continuing a business relationship with Huawei in violation of U.S. sanctions.Former diplomat Michael Kovrig embraces his wife Vina Nadjibulla following his arrival on a Canadian air force jet after his release from detention in China, at Pearson International Airport in Toronto on September 25, 2021. (Chris Halgren/Reuters)Meng’s lawyers contest this narrative.Huawei and two Huawei affiliates — Huawei Device USA Inc. (Huawei USA) and Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. (Skycom) — were indicted at the same time that Meng was charged. Their indictment was unsealed in January 2019.According to the DOJ, “Huawei and Skycom are charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and conspiracy to violate IEEPA.”One condition of Meng’s deferred prosecution deal requires that she not contest the U.S. government’s claim that she played a “principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution (HSBC).”Questions remain over how Meng’s admission will affect the cases against Huawei and Skycom. Outside legal experts argue that Meng’s admission might not stand up in court.Juan Morillo, co-chair of the White Collar and Corporate Investigations Practice in Washington, D.C., told Reuters that Huawei could argue Meng’s deal was the “product of extortion,” in that she only signed it to gain freedom.Likewise, the company can say it neither signed nor is bound by the deal.“I've been in cases similar to this, and that's what the strategy is going to be with Huawei,” Morillo said. “They'll say, ‘This is a fabrication. This is the product of extortion, and it has no binding effect on us at all.’”Another New York-based attorney, Charles Stillman, told Reuters that Meng’s agreement with prosecutors will not hold weight unless she testifies against Huawei.That corresponds with the 6th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution., which grants the accused the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”“If she does not come back (to the United States), and no one has the opportunity to cross-examine her, it is inadmissible,” Stillman said.In June, Meng’s lawyers said U.S. claims that she fraudulently misled HSBC are themselves “false and misleading.” They said their case is borne out by documents, including emails and other HSBC records, showing “there is no evidence of fraud on HSBC.”“[The documents] show that Huawei's control over Skycom was not kept from senior HSBC executives; that the continuing nature of Skycom's business with Huawei in Iran was not kept from senior HSBC executives; that internal HSBC risk-assessments were made based on knowledge of the true facts; and that any reputational risks were managed with the knowledge of senior HSBC executives,” the statement read.Those documents are not publicly available. Meng's lawyers sued HSBC to gain access to the papers, first in London, and then in Hong Kong.According to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, the company had reached a settlement with HSBC, under which Huawei apparently gained access to the materials “with a confidentiality clause attached.”However, in proceedings over Meng’s extradition from Canada to the United States, a judge did not allow the documents to be used.";https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Hostage-diplomacy-fears-linger-after-China-frees-Canadians,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-2-michaels-what-next-china-u-n1280229,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iran-exclusive/exclusive-new-documents-link-huawei-to-suspected-front-companies-in-iran-syria-idUSKCN1P21MH,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iran-probe-exclusive/exclusive-huawei-hid-business-operation-in-iran-after-reuters-reported-links-to-cfo-idUSKBN23A19B,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131,https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-huawei-tech-case-idCNL1N2QU1SE,https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/huawei-canada-media-statement-855550168.html,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/29/huawei-meng-wanzhou-cfo-extradition-emails,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58071589;China Falsely Claims Huawei Case Was ‘Fabricated’;;;;;;

Among other things, Erdogan discussed his relationship with the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, Turkey’s influence in the Middle East and the state of freedoms in his country.Interviewer Margaret Brennan asked Erdogan about human rights in Turkey and whether he discussed the topic with Biden when they met in New York at last week’s United Nations General Assembly.Erdogan said the leaders did not discuss human rights in Turkey, explaining:“We don't have any problems of that nature in terms of freedoms, Turkey is incomparably free.” But that is false. In fact, Turkey’s human rights record has been worsening for years on multiple fronts.The watchdog group Freedom House said in its most recent report on global freedom that Turkey’s ratings declined steeply during the past 10 years, a deterioration second only that of Mali. After a failed 2016 coup, Erdogan used emergency laws to purge and punish suspected opponents. Freedom House classifies Turkey as “not free,” with a rating on only 32 points on its 100-point measure of political and civil liberties. Summarizing the country’s record, the report said:“As the COVID-19 crisis threatened the economy and the government’s political standing during the year, authorities apparently sought to manipulate official health statistics and launched criminal investigations against medical professionals who released independent information about the outbreak or criticized the official response. …” “Prosecutions and campaigns of harassment against opposition politicians, prominent members of civil society, independent journalists, and critics of Turkey’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy continued throughout the year.” The U.S. State Department said in its 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released this past March, that thousands of people in Turkey, including politicians, journalists and minors, had been investigated by the government for allegedly insulting Erdogan, Turkish Republic founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or state institutions.According to the State Department, human rights abuses in Turkey included “arbitrary killings, suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary arrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, including opposition politicians and former members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, and employees of the U.S. Mission.” The report noted that human rights abuses increased in Turkey after the 2016 coup attempt. This month, the Council of Europe, which promotes human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe, said it would start proceedings against Turkey for jailing philanthropist Osman Kavala for four years without a trial.The Turkish government accuses Kavala of engaging in anti-government protests in 2013 and involvement in the 2016 attempted coup. If Turkey refuses to free Kavala, the council will consider penalties, including suspending Turkey’s membership.Also this month, the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) accused Turkey’s government of using anti-terror laws to pressure human rights defenders. The HRFT said that from March through August of this year, with the coronavirus as pretext, protests and demonstrations were banned for total of 729 days in 19 provinces, and hundreds of human rights defenders were taken into custody, fined or jailed. “The measures were taken due to the pandemic often involve arbitrary interventions that restrict human rights and freedoms, including prisons. Human rights and liberties guaranteed by the Turkish Constitution and the international conventions, to which Turkey is a party, are unlawfully restricted by decrees and circulars,” the HRFT said. Turkey also has a poor press freedom record. The 2021 press freedom index compiled the advocacy group Reporters without Borders (RSF) ranked Turkey near the bottom, at 153rd out of 180 countries. Turkey was Europe’s top jailer of journalists and second worldwide only to China: “Even if Turkey is no longer the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, the risk of imprisonment and the fear of being subjected to judicial control or stripped of one’s passport is ever-present. “The government controls 90% of the national media by means of regulators such as the High Council for Broadcasting (RTÜK), while the Press Advertising Council (BIK), which allocates state advertising, and the Presidential Directorate for Communications (CIB), which issues press cards, use clearly discriminatory practices in order to marginalize and criminalize the regime’s media critics.” On September 29, RSF called on the Turkish government to drop charges against its Turkey representative, Erol Onderoglu, for supporting the Kurdish opposition newspaper Ozgur Gundem. In a retrial, Onderoglu faces 14 years in prison on charges of “terrorist propaganda,” “praising a crime or criminal” and “condoning a crime.”In July, Turkey officially withdrew from the Council of Europe’s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence. Known as the Istanbul Convention, that groundbreaking treaty had given Turkish women’s rights advocates hope that growing femicide in the country could be reversed. The move sparked protests by women and LGBT+ groups. New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) called the move part of Erdogan’s plan to target any entity standing in the way of his “wide-ranging effort to reshape Turkey’s society.” Erdogan came to power two decades ago running against Turkish secularism on an Islamist platform. Before Turkey officially withdrew from the Istanbul Convention, Erdogan promised new human rights policies. However, International Christian Concern (ICC), an organization that advocates for the rights of Christians worldwide, said this month that Turkey had failed to fulfill its promises when it comes to religious freedom.ICC said churches in Turkey are not recognized as legitimate religious institutions and are registered as foundations or associations. Foreign Christian workers are often seen as national security threats and deported from Turkey, while historical Christian sites have been transformed to mosques or neglected, the group said.

Markey, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley reintroduced legislation aimed at defending human rights in Turkey.Called the Turkey Human Rights Promotion Act of 2021, the legislation calls on the U.S. government to use its leverage with its NATO ally to “prevent a further erosion of hard-fought democratic progress in Turkey.”";https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-face-the-nation-09-26-2021/,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-joe-biden-russia-syria-turkey-8dbe017676c00b2a0645b0bb286241e0,https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-world/2021,https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/turkey/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/7/15/turkeys-failed-coup-attempt-all-you-need-to-know,https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-kavala-europe-council-penalise-not-freed,https://en.tihv.org.tr/alternative-shadow-reports/fact-sheet-hrds-in-turkey-facing-excessive-oppression/,https://rsf.org/en/ranking,https://cpj.org/2019/12/at-least-250-journalists-jailed-worldwide-for-four/,https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-turkey-representatives-retrial-time-end-five-years-judicial-incoherence,https://www.polygraph.info/a/erdogan-defends-ditching-istanbul-treaty-while-promoting-to-fight-gender-based-violence/31349010.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/24/turkey-erdogans-onslaught-rights-and-democracy#,https://www.persecution.org/2021/09/26/human-rights-decrease-turkey-diyanet-gains-prominence/,https://www.persecution.org/2021/03/02/erdogans-human-rights-plan-hints-religious-freedom/,https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-wyden-and-merkley-reintroduce-legislation-to-defend-fundamental-human-rights-in-turkey;Erdogan’s False Claim That Turkey is ‘Incomparably Free’;;;;;;

The official results showed the ruling United Russia party won with 49.8 percent of the vote.Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov on the process:“The competitiveness, openness, and honest of the elections were and are the most important thing for the president.” That is false.As with previous major elections in the country, this year’s Duma elections were marked by reports of irregularities. But this year, ruling authorities carried out an unprecedented crackdown against opposition parties and activists, and even threatened tech giants Google and Apple. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which monitors elections worldwide, did not send an election monitoring mission to Russia to observe the vote.Although Russian authorities invited the group, they limited it to 60 observers for the whole country, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. That was far short of the 500 observers the monitoring group said would be necessary.The OSCE said Russia “did not offer sufficient clarification as to why the limitations were needed to prevent the spread of the virus when other preventative measures could be taken.” The Russian independent election monitoring group Golos, which the Kremlin has declared a “foreign agent,” said election was deeply flawed:“Regretfully, in its primary assessment of the current elections, Golos movement has to state that it cannot consider them genuinely free and fully compliant neither with the Constitution and legislation of the Russian Federation nor with the international electoral standards. The results are obtained in an unfree and unequal electoral campaign, while the passive electoral rights of a significant number of citizens were limited. This prevents us from asserting that the real will of voters was articulated in a free electoral campaign.“ Restrictive election laws severely limited who could run for Duma seats. One new regulation banned anyone associated with “extremist” organizations. In June, for example, Russia designated Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation an “extremist” organization, thereby barring the candidacy of anyone affiliated or associated with the group.Navalny, one of the most vocal political opponents of Putin and his United Russia party, survived a poisoning attempt last year only to be arrested and jailed after he returned to Russia from Germany. With its leader effectively silenced, Navalny’s team promoted a program called Smart Voting – urging Russians to vote for candidates from opposition parties to strategically oust United Russia politicians.Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation created an app to help voters follow the strategy. But on September 17, Apple and Google deleted the app from their stores after legal threats from the Russian government.The Duma elections also featured more traditional ballot rigging. In one example, cameras at polling stations recorded poll workers dumping stacks of ballots into ballot boxes. And Golos poll monitors were barred from some polling places.  Thanks to the pandemic, major cities like the capital of Moscow featured “e-voting.” The independent Moscow Times newspaper reported on September 20 that the Communist Party of the Russian Federation rejected the legitimacy of e-voting after several of its favored candidates saw their leads reversed when e-votes were counted. Before the election, authorities said e-voting results would be made public after polls closed September 19, the last day of voting. But when that moment arrived, the results were delayed several times.The day after the polls closed, Russian Central Election Commission chairperson Ella Pamfilova reported that “no major irregularities were recorded during the vote,” according to the Russian state-owned TASS news agency.TASS reported that “numerous international observers pointed out that the election process was well-organized and transparent.” However, it did not say who these observers were or explain how they made that assessment. TASS said results were “canceled” at three polling stations, two on the Russian mainland and a third in Russian-occupied Crimea. TASS also alleged there were “unprecedented” cyberattacks against the election commission’s website and e-voting system.Western officials have criticized the Duma elections. “What we have seen in the run-up to these elections was an atmosphere of intimidation of all the critical independent voices,” said European Union foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano. The U.S. State Department said voting took place “under conditions not conducive to free and fair elections.” Turkey’s Foreign Ministry declared the results from occupied Crimea invalid. Ukraine also rejected Russian voting in Crimea and illegally occupied parts of its eastern Donbas region.The day after the elections were over, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked voters and the poll workers, noting the “high” official turnout of 51 percent compared to the last elections’ 47 percent turnout in 2016. United Russia is expected to have a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat State Duma.;https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/09/21/election-officials-declare-a-majority-win-for-united-russia-in-state-duma-vote,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/08/04/osce-says-will-not-monitor-russian-parliamentary-elections-a74700,https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/russia/494488,https://www.golosinfo.org/en/articles/145501,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57422346,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-arrested-poisoning-law/31053008.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/09/17/apple-google-delete-navalny-app-on-day-of-russian-parliamentary-vote-a75069,https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-elections-voting-vladimir-putin-1a072af8580b05b134bd22df95a5ae83,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/09/20/russian-communist-party-says-wont-recognize-moscow-e-voting-results-a75087,https://tass.com/politics/1340305,https://www.state.gov/the-russian-federations-duma-elections/,https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-rejects-invalid-russian-elections-in-crimea,https://tass.com/politics/1340303,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-points-reports-massive-irregularities-russias-duma-elections-2021-09-20/;Russia’s Elections ‘Competitive, Honest?’ Not a Chance;;;;;;

That denial is misleading. Essentially, Peskov was playing a verbal shell game by mentioning “representatives of the Russian armed forces.” The supposedly “private” Wagner PMC has ties to the Russian state and defense ministry, even though Russian authorities act as if the group is independent. Using Wagner forces gives the Kremlin plausible deniability.Indeed, some analysts say Wagner PMC helps Russia dodge political liability – and make money – while intervening in various conflicts. Officially, the group is affiliated with a company owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Prigozhin also owned the so-called “troll factory” in St. Petersburg that spread disinformation on social networks and interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied using Wagner mercenaries even in countries where it has an official military presence, including the Central African Republic (CAR). In an October 2019 Russian state TV broadcast, a Russian military instructor operating in CAR denied any connections with Wagner. Yet, in that very same program, eagle-eyed viewers spotted the Wagner logo displayed in the military facility shown in the segment. According to The Moscow Times, Mali’s defense ministry did not deny that Mali’s government had discussions with Wagner. The newspaper cited an Agence-France Presse (AFP) report that a small Wagner team was first spotted in Mali’s capital Bamako in late 2019 after the country’s former president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, signed a military cooperation deal with Russia.Armed militants from the Movement for the Salvation of Azawad (MSA), a Tuareg separatist movement in the Azawad Region in Mali, gather in the desert outside Menaka on March 14, 2020 during the MSA congress.

152;;;;False;Leung Chun-ying;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-hong-kong-patriots-ccp/6743142.html;With False Pretext, Hong Kong Limits Democracy to ’Patriots’;2021-09-17;polygraph;;"On September 15, China’s state-run broadcaster CGTN published an interview with Leung Chun-ying, who served as the third chief executive of Hong Kong between 2012 and 2017.The interviewer, Dong Hue, said “violent unrest has raped Hong Kong in recent years.” She then asked whether the introduction of the new National Security Law (NSL) and the emphasis on “the principle of patriots governing Hong Kong” had helped the situation.Supporters of Tong Ying-kit, the first person charged under the new National Security Law, line up to attend the hearing at the High Court on July 30, 2021.Leung said he “believed those measures would work.”""All countries in the world require people who from their political class, the ruling echelon, to be patriots,’ Leung said. “We hear the word patriot, patriotism, patriotic, on the tips of American tongues every day, so Hong Kong should not be any exception.”But democratic states have nothing like Hong Kong’s NSL or electoral reform law, which created a candidate qualification review committee to vet who can run for office.Under this system, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) determines who is “patriotic,” not the electorate. What’s more, senior Chinese officials have admitted that their definition of patriotism entails love for China’s current political system, rather than for country.The NSL was passed on June 30, 2020, in response to the 2019–2020 Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Those demonstrations were sparked by a since-shelved extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong authorities. The bill would have allowed for Hong Kongers to be prosecuted by courts in mainland China.At their height, the protests, fueled by discontent over Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s independence, drew an estimated quarter of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people to the streets. Clashes became increasingly violent, with demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails and police using live ammunition.The NSL was intended, in part, to quell that unrest.The law criminalizes four types of activities – secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and collusion with foreign entities. The law also gives authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing sweeping powers to control the internet, media outlets, schools and other civil organizations.On September 14, Hong Kong’s security chief Chris Tan announced that new legislation expanding the list of national security offenses would be introduced.The legislation will cover “espionage activities, the theft of state secrets, activities of foreign political institutions in Hong Kong, and political ties between Hong Kong institutions and foreign countries, among other things,” Tan said, according to Radio Free Asia, a sister organization of VOA.Critics say the NSL’s “catch-all wording” empowers authorities to criminalize political views.For example, Hong Kongers face jail time for having or displaying banners, flags or other printed materials that promote Hong Kong’s independence. Chanting similar slogans is also outlawed.Just this week, the law was used to compel a Tiananmen Square vigil group, commemorating the June 4, 1989, massacre of demonstrators in Beijing, to remove all “online platform information.”According to the Hong Kong Free Press, the group said it was forced to scrub its online presence based on Article 43 of the NSL.A study by the Georgetown Center for Asian Law said the ""vast majority” of those arrested from July 1, 2020, to January 14, 2021, “would not be considered national security cases in other liberal constitutional jurisdictions.”Regarding Leung’s “patriotism” assertion, another measure, the ""Decision on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,"" laid the groundwork for overhauling Hong Kong’s political system.Article one of measure claims improving Hong Kong’s legislative system “must fully and faithfully implement the policy of ‘one country, two systems’,” as well as uphold its constitutional order under both the Chinese constitution and Hong Kong’s basic law (often described as Hong Kong’s mini-constitution).The decision is also intended to “ensure the administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people with patriots as the main body.”In November 2020, a senior CCP official said the governance of Hong Kong by people “who are patriotic and love Hong Kong” had become a new legal norm.Also that month, new laws were enacted to disqualify from Hong Kong’s Legislative Council any elected member who “support[s] Hong Kong’s independence, refuses to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city’s affairs,” The Associated Press reported.According to National Public Radio, the measure effectively gave Beijing veto power “over who sits in Hong Kong's legislature.”That prompted mass resignations of pro-democracy lawmakers, essentially leaving the legislative body without an opposition for the first time.In May, pro-Beijing legislators on the council passed a sweeping electoral reform law, which cut the number of directly-elected representatives and introduced a system to vet candidates.That law established a Candidate Eligibility Review Mechanism, under which a review committee is “responsible for assessing and validating the eligibility of candidates for the Election Committee Members, the Chief Executive, and the LegCo (legislative council) members.”In July, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam appointed seven members to serve on that review committee.Lam has likewise stressed the need for electoral reform in Hong Kong so that “patriots” could rule the city-state.As a part of that review process, Hong Kong’s National Security Department of the Police and the Committee for Safeguarding National Security will determine whether candidates are legally eligible to run for office, basing that decision, in part, on whether the candidates comply with the legal requirements and conditions for upholding the Basic Law and “bear allegiance” to Hong Kong.Critics say only candidates sufficiently loyal to the Chinese Communist Party will be allowed to run for office, with public opinion having little bearing on a politician’s success.This bears no resemblance to how voters in the United States, for example, use their personal interpretations of patriotism to assess political candidates.Scholars have noted that China’s sense of patriotism – or love of country – is really just a form of “party-centric nationalism.”When the electoral reforms were first proposed in March, Song Ru’an, the Deputy Commissioner of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, told reporters loyalty to the CCP was part and parcel of officials’ understanding of patriotism.“When we talk about patriotism, we are not talking about the abstraction of loving a cultural or historical China, but rather loving the currently existing People’s Republic of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,” the Hong Kong Free Press cited Song as saying.";https://www.npr.org/2019/11/17/780268841/hong-kong-protests-intensify-with-molotov-cocktails-and-arrows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/hong-kong-protester-shot-with-live-round-during-china-national-day-rally,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/crimes-09142021113459.html/ampRFA,https://hongkongfp.com/2020/12/26/hong-kong-reels-after-the-year-that-free-speech-died/,https://hongkongfp.com/2021/09/16/security-law-hong-kong-police-order-tiananmen-massacre-vigil-group-to-delete-online-content/,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/law-asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2021/02/GT-HK-Report-Accessible.pdf,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/11/c_139802279.htm,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-11/17/c_139523039.htm,https://apnews.com/article/legislature-democracy-hong-kong-coronavirus-pandemic-carrie-lam-f8d73dc08d0f1052993d8c3cbcdaa8c7,https://www.npr.org/2020/11/11/933780136/hong-kongs-pro-democracy-lawmakers-quit-legislature-over-ouster-of-colleagues,https://hongkongfp.com/2021/05/27/breaking-hong-kong-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-revamp-elections-reducing-democratic-representation/,https://www.cmab.gov.hk/improvement/en/qualification-review/index.html,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-07/06/c_1310045985.htm,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/loyalty-03302021135238.html,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2021/0315/Electoral-reform-In-changing-Hong-Kong-who-counts-as-a-patriot;With

They need to look closely at the areas and find out the facts.” This is false. Far from ""misinformation,"" the available evidence suggests the Taliban repeatedly violated human rights before and after its takeover of Afghanistan last month. In early September, HRW gathered credible reports that Taliban security forces had cracked down on protesters, mostly female, in Kabul. Security forces targeted journalists covering the protests, detaining some of them, confiscating equipment and in some cases flogging them.Taqi Daryabi and Nemat Naqdi of the Afghan news outlet Etilaat-e Roz were covering protests when Taliban fighters took them to a police station and beat them with cables.HRW wrote Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, urging them to ease refugee visa restrictions on humanitarian grounds and to support Afghan civil society groups working to protect human rights in the country.On September 15, HRW called for a special independent monitoring mechanism to track rights violations by the new Taliban regime, noting reports that Taliban fighters were carrying out reprisals against former government officials or their families.In July, the Taliban was accused of murdering up to 100 civilians in the Spin Boldak district of Kandahar province. The massacre was later condemned by the U.S. and U.K. embassies, which referred to them as ""revenge killings.""Also in July, a video emerged showing the execution of 22 Afghan National Army commandos who had just surrendered to Taliban forces after running out of ammunition. The unarmed men were shot despite Taliban promises of amnesty to government security forces in return for their surrender.Last month, Amnesty International reported that Taliban fighters massacred nine men in Ghazni province in July. The men, who belonged to the often-persecuted Hazara minority, were either shot or tortured to death by Taliban fighters who looted their village. Amnesty cited several firsthand witnesses to the events. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has himself promised “forgiveness” for former government officials and security forces. However, according to the BBC, many people supposedly covered by the amnesty are skeptical.The BBC found additional evidence of Taliban reprisals, including the killing of senior police officials in Badghis and Farah provinces. One of them, Haji Mullah Achakzai in Badghis province, was seen on video bound and kneeling when he was shot from behind.In August, a popular Afghan folk singer, Fawad Andarabi, was taken from his home and executed by Taliban fighters. The killing came just days after an interview with Zabihullah Mujahid in which he said that music would again be forbidden in under Taliban rule. Since returning to power nearly 20 years after being driven out of the country by a U.S.-led coalition following 9/11, the Taliban have tried to persuade the international community that they have changed.During their earlier reign over Afghanistan, the Taliban became infamous for summary executions, stripping women of their rights and forcing them to wear full veils, and forbidding television, sports and even kite-flying.The Taliban destroyed cultural landmarks, including the Bamiyan Buddha statues, two enormous monuments dating to the late 6th and early 7th centuries, in March 2001.Signs point to a return to their old ways. The Taliban said they would allow women to attend university in sex-segregated institutions, but they are not allowing women to compete in sports. On September 15, Afghanistan’s women’s soccer team reportedly fled to Pakistan to gain asylum.

It is a historical fact with iron-clad and undeniable evidence,” Zhao said.He added that “Japan should honestly face up to and reflect on its history of aggression,” and “properly handle the ‘comfort women’ issue in an honest and responsible manner.”Polygraph.info has often called out China’s attempts to rewrite history. But in this case, Zhao is correct about a matter of historical record.Although documentation is incomplete, records have surfaced showing the Japanese military played a direct role in forcing women to work in frontline brothels.According to the Asian Women's Fund, which Japan’s government established in 1994 to provide compensation to “comfort women,” “wartime comfort women” were taken to so-called “comfort stations … established at the request of the Japanese military authorities.”Citing military documents, the fund said private agents set up brothels for Japanese servicemen in China around the time the Japanese seized Mukden (modern day Shengyang) in 1931. The number of such comfort stations grew rapidly when the Second Sino-Japanese War began in 1937.Scholars have directly linked the establishment of comfort stations to the damage done to Japan’s international image after the Rape of Nanjing or Nanjing Massacre, a six-week period of mass murders and rapes committed by Imperial Japanese troops in China’s former capital of Nanjing.Carmen Argiba, a former member of Argentina’s supreme court and a judge in the Women’s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan’s Military Sexual Slavery, wrote:“By confining rape and sexual abuse to military-controlled facilities, the Japanese government hoped to prevent atrocities like the Rape of Nanking or, if such atrocities did occur, to conceal them from the international press.”Comfort women were forced into sexual slavery throughout Asia, including Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam.Lee Yong-soo, who was forced to serve for the Japanese troops as a sex slave during World War II, touches the face of a statue of a girl symbolizing the issue of wartime ""comfort women"" during its unveiling ceremony in Seoul, South Korea on August 14, 2019. Ahn Young-joon/APKorean writer Kim Il Myon has claimed that perhaps 90 percent of comfort women were Korean. That figure is unsubstantiated, although a large number of the victims of forced sexual labor were Korean.The Asian Women's Fund noted that “there are no documents with comprehensive data one could use to determine the total number,” and that it is unlikely such documents were ever compiled. It added that estimates vary depending on the “basic assumptions” of the research and methodology applied.Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a professor of Japanese modern history at Chuo University in Tokyo, who first found evidence that the Imperial Japanese Army set up and ran “comfort stations,” estimates there were 50,000 to 200,000 comfort women.Chinese scholars have put the figure at 400,000.Erin Blakemore wrote on History.com that there are few records of the women’s subjugation. Citing ""War and Public Health"", by Barry Levy and Victor Sidel, Bakemore wrote “there are very few survivors and an estimated 90 percent of ‘comfort women’ did not survive the war.”As The Japan Times newspaper wrote in 2007, Japanese politicians have claimed there was no evidence proving the Japanese military played a direct role “in ‘forcibly taking’ women to military brothels.”However, documents that the Dutch, French and Chinese governments submitted to the 1946 International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal) showed otherwise.In 2007, a group of historians discovered seven trial documents, which, according to The Japan Times, “suggest[ed] the Japanese military directly forced women to work at some of their frontline brothels in Indonesia, China, East Timor and Vietnam.”Prosecution Document No. 5330 read:“The Special Naval Police (Tokei Tai) had ordered to keep the brothels supplied with women; to this end they arrested women on the streets and after enforced medical examination placed them in the brothels.”Another document noted the brothels were “surrounded by barbed wire” and the women were only allowed to leave “with special permission.”Apart from China, South Korea’s foreign ministry called the approved textbook changes “regrettable,” saying it is an “undeniable fact” the military comfort women were forced into sexual slavery.In 1991, Kim Hak-soon was the first South Korean to testify about her experiences as a sexual slave, bringing international attention to demands for reparations and a full apology from the Japanese government.In December of that year, 35 members of the Association of Korean Victims, including three victims of sexual slavery, sued the Japanese government in Tokyo District Court over those rights violations during the Second World War.That court denied their demand for compensation, a decision which Japan’s Supreme Court upheld in 2004. U.S. courts have rejected similar cases, with a court of appeals finding “the courts of the United States simply are not authorized to hear their case.”A statue commemorating so-called ""comfort women,"" a euphemism given by Japan to the women and girls enslaved for sex by the Japanese army during World War II, in a residential area in central Berlin, Germany on October 9, 2020. Markus Schreiber/APOther lawsuits followed.In 2015, Japan and Korea reached an agreement in which Japan apologized to former comfort women and agreed to provide 1 billion yen (currently $9.1 million) to a fund to help them. In return, Japan said the “issue is resolved finally and irreversibly.”But in 2017, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called the agreement flawed, adding, “It cannot solve the comfort women issue.”This past April, Seoul Central District Court found against former comfort women, arguing Japan could not be subject to civil lawsuits filed in another country under international law. The following month, the plaintiffs said they would appeal.The 2015 agreement notwithstanding, the Japanese government has maintained that claims related to its colonial rule in Korea (1910-1945) were settled by the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.In 1996, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights advocated Korea’s position that the bilateral agreement only covered property, and not personal, damages.The U.N. Special Rapporteur on violence against women recommended that Japan acknowledge the Imperial Army’s creation of those comfort stations violated international law “and accept legal responsibility for that violation.”The special rapporteur further recommended that Japan’s government compensate the victims of sexual slavery, release all documents and materials related to the comfort stations, apologize to the survivors and, when possible, punish the surviving perpetrators.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-yuan-longping-great-famine/31290990.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-tibet-1951-liberation/31273424.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-uighurs-fact-check/30748659.html,https://www.awf.or.jp/pdf/0170.pdf,https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Argibay_-_Sexual_Slavery_the_Comfort_W_of_WWII.pdf,https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/facts-07.html,https://www.scmp.com/culture/books/article/2116687/chinese-comfort-women-accounts-japans-wartime-sex-slaves-remembered,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/12/04/940819094/photos-there-still-is-no-comfort-for-the-comfort-women-of-the-philippines,https://www.history.com/news/comfort-women-japan-military-brothels-korea,https://www.google.com/books/edition/War_and_Public_Health/aAUSDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22war%20and%20public%20health%22%20%22comfort%20women%22&pg=PA197&printsec=frontcover&bsq=%22war%20and%20public%20health%22%20%22comfort%20women%22,https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210910001500325,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/09/70-years-on-comfort-women-speak-out-so-the-truth-wont-die/,https://kls.law.columbia.edu/content/lawsuits-brought-against-japan-former-korean-comfort-women,https://casetext.com/case/hwang-geum-joo-v-japan-3,https://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/na/kr/page4e_000364.html,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/south-koreas-moon-says-2015-comfort-women-agreement-japan-flawed,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/s-korean-court-dismisses-lawsuit-filed-against-japan-comfort-women,https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/05/a8f52bfd8413-ex-comfort-women-to-appeal-s-korea-court-ruling-dismissing-case.html,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/19/national/korea-comfort-women-dismiss-court/,http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/commission/country52/53-add1.htm;Japan Shades History with Textbook Edit of Sexual Slavery;;;;;;
155;;;;Misleading;Xu Guixiang;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-xinjiang-kite-runner/6743130.html;‘The Kite Runner’ and a Chinese Time Warp in Xinjiang;2021-09-07;polygraph;;"On August 30, “The Kite Runner,” a film adapted from Afghan-American novelist Khaled Hosseini’s best-seller, became a top subject of interest on the Chinese internet – thanks to a barrage of criticism by China’s state-run media of the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on its August 30 “Live News” show that it had recently been “exposed” that the U.S. film was shot in Kashgar, Xinjiang, rather than in Afghanistan, because of security concerns.The CCTV segment included a response from Xu Guixiang, spokesperson for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region’s government, to “the hypocrisy of the United States.”“We also noticed this film. It’s The Kite Runner. ... The background of the story was set in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. After 9/11, the United States invaded Afghanistan in the name of counter-terrorism, dragging Afghanistan into war, chaos and unrest. It was difficult to find a place of peace and tranquillity, so the film crew chose to shoot in places like Kashgar and Tashkurgan in Xinjiang,"" Xu said during an August 30 news conference.“What did they [the United States] bring to Afghanistan? What they brought there were the flames of war, social unrest, and Afghan people in destitution. They can't even find a suitable place to shoot a movie there.”Xu hailed the film as proof that Xinjiang was peaceful:“China's Xinjiang, on the other hand, is stable and harmonious. The United States turns a blind eye to that and falsely accuses Xinjiang of violating human rights. How hypocritical that is.”The implication that Xinjiang was stable while Afghanistan was not is misleading and conflates different periods of Xinjiang's history under Chinese government control.It is true that the film wasn’t shot in Afghanistan because of security concerns in the war-torn country following the U.S. invasion in 2001.In fact, Afghanistan was “perhaps the second most dangerous place in the world for Americans,” The New York Times reported on the film’s search for shooting location before the film was released in 2007.Kashgar, once an important hub along the historic Silk Road trading route, was eventually chosen as the doppelgänger for prewar Kabul “for its diverse but overwhelmingly Muslim population and a countryside that plausibly resembles Afghanistan,” the Times reported.But that was in 2006 – over a decade before China ramped up mass detentions of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, home to an estimated 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim Turkic minority.According to the Times, Chinese authorities then welcomed the film project because they were “eager to put the country’s far west on the map quickly.”Muslim men arriving at the Id Kah Mosque for morning prayers on Eid al-Fitr in the old town of Kashgar on June 26, 2017.“That in itself represented a huge turnabout,” the 2007 article noted. “Not long before, foreigners were barred from traveling to the region, where separatist sentiments have long existed.”Indeed, Xinjiang has a long history of instability.Uyghurs experienced brief periods of independence, even declaring an East Turkestan state in Xinjiang several times, before the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took the region over and incorporated it into the People’s Republic of China in October 1949.Uyghur separatist groups gained traction in Xinjiang after several Muslim states in Central Asia declared independence when the Soviet Union collapsed. As Polygraph.info has reported, a Chinese government plan to incorporate the region economically led to demographic changes and increased cross-cultural contact – which, in turn, sparked separatist terrorist attacks in the 1990s.Beijing swiftly clamped down. In 2005, a Human Rights Watch report on the religious repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang noted that “celebrating religious holidays, studying religious texts, or showing one's religion through personal appearance are strictly forbidden at state schools.”Despite signs that harsh controls were loosened around the time the film crew went in, the situation in Xinjiang was anything but perfect.Tensions persisted over the migration of Han Chinese into the region and widespread economic and cultural discrimination against the Uyghurs and others.In 2009, these boiled over into deadly riots. On July 5 of that year, a protest in the regional capital of Urumqi against false rape allegations against male Uyghur factory workers became violent. China’s government claimed the rioting was “plotted and incited” by outside forces, naming the World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based organization of exiled Uyghur groups, and its leader Rebiya Kadeer. However, the underlying cause of the violence is disputed.The 2009 Urumqi riots were a watershed, experts say.“From that moment on, China took a very hard-line position toward the control of religion and the control of minority ethnic groups in the region,” Nicholas Bequelin, then Amnesty International’s regional director for East and Southeast Asia, told The Associated Press in 2019. “It increased dramatically its security operation. That really is what led to the situation today.”“In the eyes of Beijing, all Uyghurs could potentially be terrorists or terrorist sympathizers,” wrote Lindsay Maizland, senior writer covering Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. “During the next few years, authorities blamed Uyghurs for attacks at a local government office, train station, and open-air market, as well as Tiananmen Square in Beijing.”With access to much information about those attacks restricted, China’s claims remain unverifiable.In subsequent years, Beijing’s policies to control and “re-educate” Uyghurs also were carried out under the banner of counter-terrorism.Chinese President Xi Jinping officially launched the “People’s War on Terror” in 2014, after Uyghur militants set off a bomb attack at a train station in Urumqi. The bombing coincided with the final day of Xi’s visit to Xinjiang.“Build steel walls and iron fortresses. Set up nets above and snares below,” Xi directed then. “Cracking down severely on violent terrorist activities must be the focus of our current struggle.”Chinese authorities have enforced mass detentions of Uyghurs since at least 2016, and they were expanded in 2017 with the government’s adoption of “Regulations on De-extremification.” Reuters reported in November 2018 that satellite imagery showed “thirty-nine of the [detention] camps almost tripled in size between April 2017 and August 2018.”As Polygraph.info previously reported, research and reports by human rights organizations, think tanks and media, and leaked Chinese government documents, have shown that China operates a massive detention network – which China calls “Vocational Skills Education Training Centers” – where an estimated 1 million Muslims, most of them Uyghurs, have been interned.Those not detained have been subjected to intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination, forced cultural assimilation,religious restrictions, forced labor and forced sterilizations.Former detainees who fled China described being forced to renounce Islam and sing praises for the CCP, subjected to harsh living conditions and tortured during interrogation. Women said they were sexually abused and even raped.Human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have stated that China’s treatment of Uyghurs amounts to “crimes against humanity.”The U.S. State Department of State, along with the parliaments of Canada, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Lithuania, have characterized Beijing’s behavior in Xinjiang as a “genocide.”China’s government has repeatedly rejected all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, denouncing them as “politically motivated” and based on “lies.” Beijing has also resisted international calls for independent investigations in Xinjiang.In May, Georg Fahrion, the Beijing correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, traveled to Xinjiang. “Even as we observe something with our own eyes, we can’t be sure of what we are seeing,"" he wrote. ""People cannot speak freely, and state control is omnipresent.”Fahrion and his team also made a stop in Kashgar. He recalled that colleagues who had last visited Xinjiang in 2018 had described Kashgar as similar to “Baghdad after the war” and “a region that seemed to be under siege,” with “museum guards in flak jackets and imperious policemen everywhere.”Fahrion observed that this was “no longer the case” for Kashgar three years later.“The repression has changed and become less obvious … It seems like Chinese leaders believe that they have broken all resistance and can therefore allow things to relax,” he wrote.";https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:4675956477198364?from=old_pc_videoshow,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/movies/31fren.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=ad87d27aa2736916&ex=1325221200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss,https://www.hrw.org/report/2005/04/11/devastating-blows/religious-repression-Uyghurs-xinjiang,https://apnews.com/article/religion-ap-top-news-international-news-china-race-and-ethnicity-1e095c203d4a40c0a79d78d1a41634ab,https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uyghurs-xinjiang,https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/chinas-peoples-war-against-terrorism/,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/secret-documents-reveal-china-mass-detention-camps-work-67271462,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/muslims-camps-china/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-Uyghurs-fact-check/30748659.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-as-new-Uyghur-detention-facilities-emerge-china-denials-and-disinfo-persist/30864997.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-xinjiang-religious-freedom/31004192.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-forced-labor-uyghurs-xinjiang/31362816.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-Uyghur-baby-machines/31043985.html,https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting#_ftn46,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/,https://www.voanews.com/americas/chinas-treatment-Uyghurs-genocide-canadian-parliament-says,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-china-Uyghurs-idUSKBN2AP2CI,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-declares-genocide-chinas-xinjiang-raises-pressure-johnson-2021-04-22/,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/lithuanian-parliament-latest-call-chinas-treatment-uyghurs-genocide-2021-05-20/,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/us-classifies-chinas-policies-toward-Uyghurs-genocide,http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/in-the-sinister-disneyland-of-xinjiang-china-s-ongoing-oppression-of-the-Uyghurs-a-8f34a7d2-cdcf-4083-bd5b-bd58ab519b47;‘The Kite Runner’ and a Chinese Time Warp in Xinjiang;;;;;;
156;;;;False;Ghassan el-Zamel;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-syria-oil-spill/6743129.html;Syria Misrepresents Scale of Mediterranean Oil Spill;2021-09-07;polygraph;;A large oil spill off Syria’s western shores has been spreading eastward across the Mediterranean Sea, edging close to Cyprus. The spill began on August 23, when a dilapidated oil container belonging to a power plant in the coastal city of Baniyas leaked though a crack in its walls. The Syrian government immediately downplayed the problem, claiming everything was under control and a clean-up nearly complete. The country’s electricity minister, Ghassan el-Zamel, told the Alwatan newspaper that the spill was under investigation and that a national disaster had been averted by a rapid response from power plant crews. “What happened cannot be described as pollution, but the incident was noticeably hyped through social media,” he said. But that is false. Neighboring countries and global environmental groups are crying foul. While Syria claimed most of the spill was on its own shoreline, satellite photos showed it had spread afar.Images from Orbital EOS, a Spanish Maritime Safety & Rescue Agency software platform, captured a huge floating pond of fuel heading into open seas, toward Cyprus. The Syrian Directorate of Ports said cleaning efforts were being made by hand because advanced clean-up equipment and maintenance parts were unattainable as a result of the sanctions imposed on Syria. The U.S. government designated Syria a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979. Since the uprising in Syria in 2011 and subsequent civil war, the U.S. has tightened economic sanctions on Syria to punish the regime’s aggression against civilians. The Mediterranean Marine Initiative, an effort by the nonprofit World Wide Fund for Nature, issued a statement on September 1 expressing concern about the spill and its long-term impact. “An 800 km2 oil spill is threatening the coastline of Cyprus and Turkey, with potentially devastating consequences for marine biodiversity and ecosystems,” the statement said. That is an area approximately the same size as New York City, including all its boroughs.Cypriot authorities monitored the oil slick as it initially headed toward Cyprus’ Turkish-controlled Apostlos Andreas Cape, 130 kilometers west of the Syrian coast. But a Cypriot official later said the slick had moved away from the divided island’s eastern shore. On August 31, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the coast guard was monitoring the slick from the air, and there were hopes it could be contained in the open sea. “We are taking the necessary measures by mobilizing every means available that we have without giving any chance to the spill to turn into an environmental disaster,” Oktay said. Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry said the oil slick is being carried northward by coastal streams and does not pose a risk to Israeli shorelines. In February, blobs of sticky tar showed up on Israeli beaches, forcing them to close. Israel said later that an Iranian-owned ship had dumped crude oil nearby, describing it an act of “eco-terrorism.” Syria marked 10 years of war this past March. A decade of conflict has left barely a town or a village unaffected. The U.N. estimates that the war in Syria has claimed 400,000 lives and displaced 12 million people, leaving them either internally displaced or refugees in neighboring countries. According to a report by Syria Direct, an independent media organization for democracy and justice in Syria, the country “has witnessed the insidious impact of war on its natural environment.” The report added that the widespread destruction in Syria has ravaged its environment and natural habitats. Wildfires have been raging across forests in coastal areas during summers. In the north, makeshift oil refineries have contaminated the soil and the water. War and upheavals in some Mediterranean countries are adding to their human and environmental woes. In Libya, the destruction of infrastructure and years of negligence have led to a wide contamination of its coastal areas. In late August, Libyan officials shut down the country’s beaches because of the sewage and trash that have been piling up on its shores for years.;https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-business-syria-environment-and-nature-oil-spills-97a8a15120ccac7ffe2c9e9c8cbcb612,https://twitter.com/wammezz/status/1430435106758569984?s=20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/01/syrian-oil-spill-moving-towards-cyprus-appears-partially-dissolve,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/middleeast/israel-oil-spill-ecological-disaster-intl-hnk/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=927881497935971&id=369758513748275,https://www.wwfmmi.org/newsroom/latest_news/?uNewsID=4408466,https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/JordanLevine1.shtml,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/31/middleeast/syria-cyprus-oil-spill-intl/index.html,https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/oil-slick-moving-away-from-cypriot-shores/,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkey-working-to-keep-syrian-oil-slick-from-reaching-northern-cyprus-/2351028,https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/syria-oil-spill-does-not-currently-pose-a-risk-to-israel-678027,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/middleeast/israel-oil-spill-ecological-disaster-intl-hnk/index.html,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/leading-journal-confirms-iranian-tanker-spilled-oil-in-israeli-waters-661319,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-civil-war-still-living-nightmare-10-years-bashar-assad-russia-un-us/,https://syriadirect.org/syrias-nature-lovers-lament-ecological-losses-after-a-decade-of-war/,https://www.africanews.com/2021/08/26/pollution-plagues-libya-beaches/;Syria Misrepresents Scale of Mediterranean Oil Spill;;;;;;
157;;;;Misleading;Chris Sweeney;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-benjamin-glynn-deported-singapore/6743127.html;RT Misleads After an Anti-Masker is Booted From Singapore;2021-09-06;polygraph;;"On August 29, Russian state broadcaster RT ran a commentary titled, “I was thrown in jail and a mental institution, then deported from Singapore … for not wearing a Covid-19 mask.”The item includes an interview with Benjamin Glynn, a 40-year-old British citizen who was arrested, convicted and ultimately deported from Singapore last month for a number of offenses stemming from his refusal to follow a mask mandate, which required that everyone aged six and above wear a mask when leaving home, including on public transport.A couple sits near the Merlion statue, a popular tourist landmark, on Monday, May 31, 2021. (Annabelle Liang/AP)Glynn first came to the attention of law enforcement following a confrontation with other passengers for his refusal to wear a mask while riding a train on Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit system.The op-ed begins:“Don’t like wearing masks? Neither does Benjamin Glynn. But his refusal to wear one, on account of his failure to accept Singapore’s right to make them legally mandatory, saw him treated like a terrorist, as he tells RT.”However, that statement, and several key omissions, highly distort the events that led to Glynn’s arrest and deportation.The commentary continues a pattern of coverage on RT that has criticized other nations’ efforts to reverse the COVID-19 pandemic. Meantime, since June, daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Russia climbed to a record high.Singapore, a wealthy city-state in Southeast Asia with a reputation for strict law enforcement, was undergoing a partial lockdown to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of Glynn’s arrest.The mask mandate had been instituted in April 2020.The op-ed said “a passenger videoed [Glynn] not wearing a Covid mask,” but the article makes no mention of witnesses who claimed Glynn initiated the May 7 incident on a train that ultimately led to his arrest.According to Jerome Tan, an education company director who took the video, it was Glynn who first engaged another passenger on the issue of wearing masks.“He was talking to an old man, trying to convince him to take off his mask, saying it’ll make him sick,” Tan told the Singapore-based web aggregator and online journalism web portal STOMP.According to STOMP, another commuter reportedly told Glynn to stop bothering others on the train.By comparison, RT wrote that Glynn helped the elderly man get on the train because he “had been struggling to breathe in his mask.”Video evidence of that alleged interaction is not available.RT also makes no mention of the Glynn’s conspiratorial beliefs, some of which were expressed during the incident on the train, and are still publicly available. In the video shot by Tann, Glynn can be heard saying “he will never wear a mask,” adding he “hates seeing grandads with the mask on not being able to breath.”He then asks the passengers if they know “what’s behind all this,” and whether they’ve “researched Bill Gates.”Gates, the Microsoft cofounder, has been described as a “voodoo doll” for myriad conspiracies related to the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines and nefarious global depopulation plots.“I’ve researched this quite a lot, and it’s not COVID,” Glynn continues, echoing COVID-19 denialism.Glynn scoffs when another passenger offers him a mask. This led Tan to approach the station manager, with rail authorities filing a police report, STOMP reported.According to RT, Glynn said he was “happy to have a chat with [police],” but objected to being taken in so late, as two plain clothes police officers approached him at a condominium before midnight on May 8.“Things turned ugly, and officers used batons which led to an ambulance being called due to Glynn bleeding from his knees, elbows and shoulders,” RT wrote, citing Glynn as the source.However, RT omitted police testimony that Glynn became increasingly agitated with officers, telling them that “COVID-19 was all a hoax” and claiming he was trying to help an elderly person on the train, Yahoo News Singapore reports.Glenn reportedly refused to wait for uniformed officers, prompting officer Chee Xiu Quan to detain him. Chee testified that Glynn pulled away from him and refused to be handcuffed. Chee says Glenn then threatened him.“He [Glenn] adopted a boxing stance and told me he would '[expletive] drop us both', so in light of that … we affected arrest,” Chee said.Chee says he drew his extendable baton as Glynn was “actively resisting” arrest. He testified that he struck Glynn in the right thigh after Glynn “took a step and lunged towards both me and (my fellow officer).”That prompted Glynn to flee. Chee testified that in pursuit, he pushed Glynn to the ground after Glynn slipped, and tripped him when he tried to stand up.Glynn was then detained and brought to the police station. The officer did not have a body camera turned on during the incident. Claims that Glynn was bleeding or needed medical attention are unsubstantiated.Glynn was charged with not wearing a mask on the train, causing a public nuisance and threatening a police officer.He received a fourth charge for not wearing a mask in the vicinity of the court after appearing for a hearing on July 2, where his bail conditions were set.It was that count which resulted in Glynn being rearrested on July 19 for violating bail terms.The RT report also omits that Glynn claims to be a “sovereign citizen,” referring to a U.S.-born conspiracy theory which broadly believes people are only bound to their own interpretations of common law, and not actual laws and regulations.Those beliefs were the basis of his legal defense, in which Glynn called the proceedings a “farce” and that the court had no “lawful jurisdiction” over him.During trial, Glynn identified Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman as his “legal counsel.” Abdul Rashid, who is neither an advocate or a solicitor, described himself as ""ambassador-at-large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda.”Abdul Rashid said he was there to defend his “sovereign compatriot,” adding he didn’t “need a license to practice [law].”The judge did not allow Abdul Rashid to represent Glynn.A website for Kingdom Filipina Hacienda describes it as an “autocratic sovereign monarchy.” It contains numerous references to the sovereign citizens movement, “One World Government” conspiracies and biblical prophecy.As noted in the Singapore-based Straights Times:“The group claims sovereignty on the basis of divine empowerment and the principles of ‘common law.’ But for all its claims and hundreds of pages of legalese, Kingdom Filipina Hacienda holds the legal recognition of, at best, an unregistered fan club here.”RT wrote that Glynn asked the judge three times what law required him to wear a mask in public, claiming that “seemingly angered the authorities,” after which he was sent for a psychiatric evaluation.In fact, when Glynn asked one investigation officer if he had broken the law, the officer replied in court: ""Yes, it was currently law during this pandemic, not covering your nose and mouth is breach under Regulation 3A(1) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020.”The psychiatric evaluation was prompted by the nature of Glynn’s anti-masker rants in the courtroom, as well as a letter from people who knew Glynn.“The prosecution received a letter from the accused’s family and friends ... (who) report a marked change in behavior in the accused person that was noticeable especially after the COVID-19 restrictions set in,” Yahoo News Singapore cites Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh as telling the court.The letter said Glynn’s views had taken an increasingly conspiratorial bent, with “reports of increasing hostility to family members when they try to gently counsel him regarding his view.”Glynn was remanded into custody from July 19 to August 4, and was then sent to the Institute of Mental Health from August 5 to August 18.Being found competent to stand trial, Glynn was sentenced to six weeks in jail on August 18. That sentence was backdated, resulting in Glynn being transferred to immigration authorities for deportation.Polygraph.info contacted the author of the op-ed, Chris Sweeney, regarding the omissions and discrepancies in his piece. Sweeny declined to comment. RT had not responded to request for comment at the time of publication.

158;;;;Misleading;Maria Zakharova;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-press-freedom/6743128.html;Russia Expels a BBC Reporter, Then Feigns Tit-For-Tat;2021-09-03;polygraph;;"BBC senior correspondent Sarah Rainsford left Moscow on August 31, after the Russian Foreign Ministry refused to renew her visa. The next day, the BBC said Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) had declared Rainsford a national security threat and barred her indefinitely.After the BBC first reported Russia’s rejection of Rainsford’s visa renewal request in mid-August, its director-general, Tim Davie, said: “The expulsion of Sarah Rainsford is a direct assault on media freedom which we condemn unreservedly.”Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said Rainsford’s ban was retaliation for the U.K.’s “visa prosecution” of Russian journalists in 2019 and for Britain’s “discriminatory approach” toward Russian media.“I will emphasize once again: The Russian measure is exclusively retaliatory. It has nothing to do with any infringement of freedom of speech,” Zakharova wrote on Telegram.That is misleading.Rainsford was booted amid a widening Russian campaign against independent domestic and foreign press, employing media bans, license cancellations and work restrictions. Furthermore, the allegation that the U.K. has a “discriminatory approach” toward Russian media is a gross misrepresentation.The PurgeIn her final dispatch before being expelled from Russia, which the BBC published on August 1, Rainsford said she may have been targeted for her reporting.“When I was called in to the foreign ministry in Moscow, they insisted my expulsion was nothing personal,” she wrote. “Officially, they call it retaliation for a TASS news agency reporter denied leave to remain in the UK. But that was two years ago and there was no fuss at all at the time.”Rainsford said that on August 10, upon her return from a reporting trip to Belarus, she was “taken aside at passport control at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport and told I'd been barred from Russia by the FSB security service.”While in Belarus, Rainsford had reported critically about Belarussian dictator Alexander Lukashenko’s crackdown of protesters in the aftermath of last year’s widely criticized election.BELGIUM -- Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya shows torture pictures next to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell during an informal breakfast with EU foreign affairs ministers on September 21, 2020.Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has ruled Belarus since 1994. Mass protests swept over Belarus last year when Lukashenko declared an election victory after imprisoning or exiling virtually all his leading political opponents.Lukashenko brutally put down the protests, with reports that protesters were beaten, arrested, tortured and some even killed.During Lukashenko’s annual news conference on August 9 Rainsfords asked him “how could he possibly stay on as president after such brutality and torture of peaceful protesters,” and for his reaction to resulting sanctions by the U.K.“You can choke on your sanctions!” Lukashenko answered, “You are American lapdogs!” He denied wrongdoing, claiming the protesters had deliberately inflicted harm on themselves in order to frame him.The video of Lukashenko’s angry outburst to Rainsford has since gone viral.Rainsford, who had reported from Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, said in her last dispatch that since Putin was first elected Russian president 20 years ago, she had been “charting the slow erosion of freedoms, the increasing suppression of dissent as Mr. Putin maneuvers to keep power.” According to Rainsford, the Kremlin’s crackdown on the media has intensified over the last year after the protests in Belarus made the Kremlin “nervous.”Russian authorities “seem set on stamping out critical voices here,” she said. “Silencing the free press is central to that.”The Russian authorities have used various laws to silence independent voices, labeling journalists and outlets extremist, registering them as undesirables and listing them as foreign agents.“What was once a disparate collection of draconian laws and legislative amendments has now coalesced into a single campaign,” wrote Meduza, an independent news site that a Russian court has designated a foreign agent, on August 27.This year alone, Russia designated more than 20 news outlets as foreign agents, including the popular Dozhd television channel, which often hosts the Kremlin critics. It also banned Proekt, an investigative website that had been exposing corruption among top Russian government officials, as “undesirable.”Russia’s foreign agent law and designation of media outlets as “undesirable” are “meant to silence freedom of the press and freedom of speech,” wrote Roman Badanin, Proekt’s founder and former chief editor, in a Washington Post op-ed on September 1.“Over the past few months, the authorities began treating me and my colleagues like public enemy number one. First, they charged us with criminal libel; then they raided our apartments and brought us in for interrogation,” Badanin wrote.He said designating Proekt as an undesirable organization was the final step in silencing it. “Any journalist, expert or whistleblower who talks to us faces imprisonment for up to five years.”On July 15, the office of Russia’s Prosecutor General said Proekt had been designated as an “undesirable” organization because “its activities pose a threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security of the Russian Federation.”Rainsford wrote in her final dispatch that this was the same wording the Russian customs officer had used when informing her of her expulsion.U.K. VisasIn November 2019, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said British authorities had denied visas to two Russian journalists “without explanation.” It provided no further details.The Russian Foreign Ministry later repeated the claim but did not provide verifiable information to back it up.However, on August 19, after the news of Rainsford’s expulsion broke, the Russian Journalists Union issued a statement demanding to “end discrimination and unprecedented pressure against Russian journalists” based in the U.K. The statement also, for the first time, identified the journalist whose visa the British authorities refused to renew in 2019 as Igor Brovarnik, London correspondent for Russia’s TASS state news agency.TASS itself did not comment on Brovarnik’s U.K. visa, nor does it have a reporter’s profile of him. The byline “Igor Brovarnik” first appeared on a report from London in April 2015 and last on September 2, 2019.Brovarnik’s U.K. coverage varied, from Brexit to sports news. He also reported on the British investigations of the two high-profile poisonings in which Russian security services have been implicated: The 2018 poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer with the Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, England, and the 2006 poisoning of a former FSB officer with radioactive polonium in London.GERMANY -- A mock offer of ""Novichok Tea"" is seen in front of an effigy of Russian President Vladimir Putin outside the Russian embassy in Berlin, September 23, 2020.Before reporting from the U.K., Brovarnik was stationed in Bulgaria. Unusually for a journalist, Brovarnik has no public online presence, no biography, and no social media accounts. Other than a May 2013 photograph with Simeon Borisov von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, last heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and a group photo of TASS correspondents in London celebrating the new year in 2019, the Internet has no information on Igor Brovarnik.On September 1, Russia’s Ambassador to the U.K. Andrei Kelin told the BBC that Russian journalists in the U.K. work in “terrible conditions” and are “unable to attend many events” or “open bank accounts, because the banks have been instructed not to [open accounts].”The Associated Press reported: “The U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office rejected Moscow’s claim of discriminatory action against Russian journalists based in the U.K. and insisted that ‘Russian journalists continue to work freely in the U.K., provided they act within the law and the regulatory framework’.”In 2018, Britain’s media regulator, OFCOM, launched a public confidence investigation against the Russian government-owned outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) and found that seven RT programs breached its broadcasting code standards for impartiality and accuracy. The programs covered the Salisbury poisoning and the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.In July 2019, OFCOM imposed a fine of 200,000 British pounds (about $276,000) on RT’s license holder, ANO TV-Novosti, and ordered RT broadcast the summary of OFCOM findings “in a form and on dates determined by OFCOM.”RT’s breaches “represented serious and repeated failures of compliance with our rules,” OFCOM said. But OFCOM did not impose any restrictions on RT staff and operations in the U.K. or suspend RT’s license.The claim that U.K. authorities have singled out Russian media outlets is misleading. OFCOM investigates both domestic and foreign media when it receives public complaints.As for Russian Ambassador Klein’s claim that Russian journalists in the U.K were denied banking services, that is a reference to the events in 2015 and 2016, when several British banks stopped servicing the accounts of entities financed by the Russian government in order to comply with EU sanctions imposed for Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine.Russia’s U.K. embassy lists on its website the bureaus of Russian media located in London, including eight TV channels, three news agencies and four newspapers. All, except for a publication owned by the Russian Orthodox Church, are state-affiliated or fully state-funded media.The Russian embassy’s website has no statement or mention of any media restrictions imposed by U.K. authorities on the Russian media bureaus.In the United States, RT has been required to register as a foreign agent since 2017. The registration does not impose restrictions but requires RT to report its spending and activities.Moreover, such requirements are not exclusively targeted at Russian media. As Polygraph.info has reported, Canadian, Australian, Chinese and other state-run media also must register as foreign agents.";https://twitter.com/BBCWomansHour/status/1433047501465063426?s=20,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58203842,https://tass.com/russia/1325961,https://telegra.ph/K-situacii-vokrug-korrespondenta-moskovskogo-byuro-Bi-bi-si-SRejnsford-08-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58395121,https://www.polygraph.info/a/belarus-lukashenko-fact-check/30755492.html,https://www.voanews.com/europe/rights-group-accuses-belarusian-authorities-mass-arrests-torture,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-state-news-falsely-claims-belarus-protester-killed-himself-/30788725.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL0IWt4ouCY,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58395121,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/08/27/the-enemies-list,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/01/roman-badanin-russia-foreign-agent-law-journalists/,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/11912045,https://tass.ru/politika/7158229,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-renew-bbc-journalist-visa-171714218.html,https://tass.ru/search?searchStr=%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C%20%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA&sort=date,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-novichok-charges-gru-zakharova/29474004.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33678717,https://www.kingsimeon.bg/en/2013/05/negovo-velichestvo-prie-ruski-zhurnali/,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/5922717,https://tass.ru/politika/12222307,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-state-tv-bbc-correspondents-visa-renewal-refused-79436797,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv-radio-and-on-demand/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/section-five-due-impartiality-accuracy,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/bulletins/content-sanctions-adjudications/decision-tv-novosti,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2019/ofcom-fines-rt,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/how-ofcom-deals-with-tv-and-radio-complaints,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-rt-accounts-closed-in-uk/28058652.html,https://london.mid.ru/ru/contact/rossiyskie_zhurnalisty_v_anglii/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-fara-fact-check/28858396.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-simonyan-fara-russia-us/28868377.html;Russia Expels a BBC Reporter, Then Feigns Tit-For-Tat;;;;;;

Peskov claimed the U.S. could encourage Ukraine to fulfill the Minsk II accords – the peace agreement from 2015 aimed at ending war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.""We are not in a position to interfere in the affairs of two sovereign countries – the United States and Ukraine – and we are not going to do so,"" Peskov said. ""But we keep a very close watch on the results of this trip, from the standpoint the United States can use its influence on Mr. Zelensky to persuade him to follow the path of implementing the Minsk agreements, as well as the agreements that were concluded in Paris, and to give up actions that might cause tremendous harm to the entire Minsk settlement process.” The claim that Russia is “not in a position to interfere” in Ukraine’s affairs is preposterous. Since 2014, Russia has interfered in Ukraine militarily by occupying the Crimean peninsula and fomented the ongoing conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region, providing troops, mercenaries, arms and other war-making supplies.The Minsk II agreement, signed between Ukraine, Russia, and the latter’s two proxy states, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, included conditions to be fulfilled by both sides to end the fighting, which began in the spring of 2014.At the time it was signed, Ukraine was facing a renewed Russian offensive and some of its forces were surrounded in the key town of Debaltseve. The Minsk II protocol called for a total ceasefire. However, when the deadline came, Russian forces and their proxies continued fighting until they had secured Debaltseve.Since then, ceasefire violations have occurred regularly along the lines of contact.On September 1, U.S. President Joe Biden hosted a meeting with Zelensky at the White House, the first such meeting for the Ukrainian president since he took office in 2019.“And the United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and — and — our support for Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations,” Biden said before the bilateral meeting. “Today, we’re going to discuss how the U.S. can continue to support Ukraine as it advances its democratic reforms, agenda, and movement toward being completely integrated in Europe.” One of the first agreements signed that day was a $60 million military aid package, which includes lethal weapon systems such as the FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missile. The Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske also reported on the signing of deals totaling $2.5 billion between U.S. defense contractors and the Ukrainian state defense contractor Ukroboronprom. At the White House, Zelensky also told Biden that he was seeking U.S. assistance in freeing 450 Ukrainian detainees held by Russia, in occupied Crimea, Donbas and within the Russian Federation’s legally-recognized territory.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-ukraine-russia-donbas/28912097.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-fact-check-as-military-tensions-rise-mythical-russian-aggression-is-very-real-in-ukraine-/31182288.html,https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/reports,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/01/remarks-by-president-biden-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-before-bilateral-meeting/,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/570194-us-pledges-60m-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-ahead-of-zelensky-visit?rl=1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COKC5ZU6gM;Russia Says it Can’t Interfere in Ukraine – While it Meddles in Ukraine;;;;;;
160;;;;False;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-capitol-riots/6743115.html;Putin Falsely Equates U.S. Capitol Rioters With Navalny;2021-08-25;polygraph;;"On August 20, outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Moscow and met with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Merkel, who speaks Russian, steps down after next month’s elections, ending 16 years as Germany’s leader.Merkel’s visit coincided with the anniversary of last year’s poisoning of leading Putin political rival Alexey Navalny, allegedly with the involvement of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).Navalny has been in a Russian jail since January, when he returned after medical treatment in Germany. For leaving the country, he was convicted of a probation violation – a prosecution that the U.S., Merkel and others say was political.Russia denies poisoning Navalny or jailing him for retribution, and Putin was asked about it at a joint news conference following the Merkel summit.“Regarding the fugitive you’ve mentioned, thus he is convicted not for his political activity but for committing a crime,” he said. Then, turning to the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, he said:“When people entered the Congress after the well-known elections in the U.S., they came with political demands after which more than 100 criminal cases had been launched against them. Judging by the charges against them, they are facing long term imprisonment – from 15 to 20-25 years and maybe longer.”That is false. There is no equivalence between Navalny and the Capitol mob.The rioters who stormed the building do face criminal charges, but not for their political views. The charges are related to the destruction and violence they perpetrated – and that resulted in deaths and scores of injuries to police from the rampaging crowd.The U.S. Justice Department’s investigation has led to 615 criminal cases against people in the mob. Of those, about 40 have pleaded guilty, some facing potential prison sentences of three to four years. Others have been given probationary terms for minor offenses, the Voice of America reported on August 24.The department has been struggling to bring the riot cases to court because investigators have been overwhelmed by the bulk of evidence, NPR reported.Many rioters took photos and videos of themselves and others with cellphones and shared them on social media. The media files have been critical in identifying the rioters and the role they played, NPR said.To help speed up the progress, prosecutors have informally put the accused into three categories, NPR reported, citing sources in the investigation.These include “tourist cases” for those who entered the Capitol but were nonviolent; people who broke in and did damage; and right-wing extremists.The question of whether the Capitol riot was preplanned remains unanswered, The New York Times reported on June 30. For its part, the Times’ visual investigations team reviewed “thousands of videos” from social media, surveillance, and police body cameras to analyze the events of January 6.“By identifying and tracking key players throughout the day, we found that most — even some at the forefront of the action — were ardent, but disorganized Trump supporters swept up in the moment and acting individually,” the Times concluded.The Times reported that the crowd included groups “who seemed eager for a confrontation, like well-organized militias and far-right groups including the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.”The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had “scant evidence” that the attack on the U.S. Capitol was coordinated, Reuters reported on August 20.Navalny has served about seven months of a two-year prison term. Rights groups say the fraud offense for which he was on probation was bogus and politically motivated. Navalny had been reporting to probation officials but was in a coma when he was flown to Germany for treatment after the poisoning.Russian authorities claimed they had to arrest Navalny on his return to Moscow because he “systematically and repeatedly violated” his probation, the Russian independent news site Meduza reported.In June, the Russian government banned all organizations involved with Navalny’s anti-corruption efforts, labeling them extremist. On the anniversary of his poisoning, Navalny wrote a commentary published simultaneously by mainstream newspapers in the U.K., Germany and France.He accused Putin’s government of widespread corruption and referred to his experience with dark irony.“When a country’s senior management is preoccupied with protection rackets and extortion from businesses, the quality of covert operations inevitably suffers,” Navalny wrote. “A group of FSB agents applied the nerve agent to my underwear just as shoddily as they incompetently dogged my footsteps for three and a half years.”Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption team published this video titled ""Putin's Palace. The Story of the World's Biggest Bribe"" after Navalny was arrested in Moscow upon his return from Germany in January.Marking the anniversary of Navalny’s poisoning, on August 20 the United States and Britain imposed additional sanctions targeting the Russian FSB. The sanctions named seven top Russian government officials allegedly involved in the poisoning.“The Kremlin’s use of chemical weapons to silence a political opponent and intimidate others demonstrates its flagrant disregard for international norms,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.";https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/merkel-putin-discuss-afghanistan-major-issues-79558072,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fsb-fails-damage-control-of-navalny-s-phone-call-/31025420.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/02/02/i-was-in-a-coma-navalny-ridicules-allegation-he-failed-to-meet-parole-officers-in-moscow-court-hearing/?sh=4d6523c93771,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/02/russian-court-rules-jail-navalny,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-arrested-poisoning-law/31053008.html,http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66418,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55575260,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html,https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/capitol-breach-cases,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/plea-deal-possible-capitol-rioter-dressed-george-washington,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/27/1013500073/the-justice-department-is-struggling-to-bring-capitol-riot-cases-to-trial-heres-,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/jan-6-capitol-attack-takeaways.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/jan-6-capitol-attack-takeaways.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-fbi-finds-scant-evidence-us-capitol-attack-was-coordinated-sources-2021-08-20/,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/aleksei-navalnys-ngos-banned-as-extremist-depriving-thousands-of-their-rights/,https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/01/14/russian-prison-officials-say-they-are-obliged-to-arrest-navalny-upon-his-return-to-moscow,https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/01/14/russian-prison-officials-say-they-are-obliged-to-arrest-navalny-upon-his-return-to-moscow,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-whose-palace-is-it-anyway-kremlin-s-less-than-upfront-reaction-to-navalny-video/31072058.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-extremism-investigation/30988860.html,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/19/action-against-corruption-russian-sanctions-oligarchs-alexei-navalny,https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/gastbeitrag-von-nawalnyj-wir-muessen-den-korrupten-autokraten-harte-fragen-stellen-17491946.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2021/08/19/alexei-navalny-la-corruption-doit-etre-le-principal-sujet-des-sommets-internationaux_6091830_3232.html,https://palace.navalny.com/,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0045;Putin Falsely Equates U.S. Capitol Rioters With Navalny;;;;;;
161;;;;Unsubstantiated;Nicaragua Interior Ministry;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-nicaragua-attack-on-ngo/6743114.html;Ortega’s Groundless Attack on Humanitarian, Democracy Groups in Nicaragua;2021-08-24;polygraph;;On August 16, Reuters reported that the communist-led Nicaraguan government had canceled permits for six foreign non-governmental organizations operating in the country. The groups promote democracy and offer development and humanitarian aid. The groups “have failed to comply with their obligations under the laws that regulate non-profit organizations,” the government’s official register reported. The allegation is unsubstantiated. A more likely explanation: The move advances President Daniel Ortega’s aggressive clampdown on journalists, opposition leaders, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and rights groups in the run-up to November elections. In July, the Nicaraguan parliament voted 70-16 to shut down 24 NGOs, most of them working in health care. The Ministry of Government (MIGOB) similarly alleged that the organizations hadn’t provided “detailed” accounts of their financial dealings. Medical groups, including the Nicaraguan Medical Association and the Nicaraguan Society of General Medicine, were most affected. Several of these groups claimed the action was retaliation for criticism of the Ortega government’s coronavirus pandemic response.The government has been widely condemned for a cavalier approach to virus containment and for underreporting COVID-19 cases. The July legislation also transfers the groups’ assets to the state, according to news reports.During the month of July, Vice President and First Lady Rosario Murillo amped up the pressure, issuing what were perceived by some as threats to medical professionals. “You pay for everything in life, and if we do harm, harm will reach us,” she said.Vilma Nunez, president of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH), said harassment of health care workers has led some to stop practicing and others to flee. Three doctors were questioned by the Ministry of Health about their media statements.Rights groups and Ortega’s opponents see a systematic campaign of suppression. As of late July, 22 opposition leaders had been arrested or detained, including seven potential presidential candidates, the Associated Press reported. Many of those arrested are “being held incommunicado, at undisclosed locations and with no access to lawyers or family visits,” the AP said. Agence France-Presse put the number of critics arrested at 32 as of August 10.Last week, Soraya Rodriguez, a member of the European Parliament from Spain, told VOA that the number of political prisoners is 140. Citing an August 14 raid on opposition newspaper La Prensa, the arrests of opponents and attacks on civil groups, she said the election has become a “farce.”“We can say that in Nicaragua there is not the slightest, the slightest possibility of a free exercise of civil rights, of political rights,” Rodriquez said.Ortega, 75, is seeking a fourth consecutive term as president, backed by his communist Sandinista National Liberation Front. Carmella Rogers, head of the opposition Citizens Alliance for Liberty party, decided to leave the country on August 10. Officials have canceled her passport and identity card and disqualified the party from the upcoming election.In early August, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Nicaraguan election “lost all credibility” after the Citizens Alliance for Liberty party was banned.“This autocratic maneuver follows the detention of seven presidential candidates and 24 other opposition figures, human rights activists, business leaders, students, and NGO workers over the last two months,” Blinken said.“The United States views the regime’s latest undemocratic, authoritarian actions – driven by Ortega’s fear of an electoral loss – as the final blow against Nicaragua’s prospects for a free and fair election later this year.”On August 2, the European Union sanctioned eight Nicaraguan individuals, including Vice President Murillo, citing serious human rights violations. These sanctions subject the named individuals to travel bans in EU designated territories. A few days later, the United States issued visa restrictions on 50 people who allegedly profited from Ortega’s presidency. This list includes relatives of government officials as well as members of the judiciary.“Without strong and sustained international pressure, the Ortega government will have no incentive to curb the crackdown and eventually allow free and fair elections,” New York-based Human Rights Watch said.The six foreign organizations whose licenses were revoked are Danish NGO Oxfam Ibis, Spain's Oxfam Intermon Foundation, Sweden's Diakonia, the U.S. National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, The International Republican Institute (U.S.) and Helping Hands The Warren William Pagel, MD Foundation (U.S.).;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaraguan-government-cancels-registration-six-foreign-ngos-2021-08-16/,https://www.dw.com/en/nicaraguan-president-ortega-eyes-dictatorship/a-58113576,https://www.vozdeamerica.com/nicaragua/eurodiputada-rodriguez-seguir-llamandolo-elecciones-es-contribuir-esta-farsa,https://www.vozdeamerica.com/libertad-de-prensa/gobierno-nicaragua-allana-instalaciones-de-periodico-la-prensa,https://www.wionews.com/world/nicaragua-parliament-shutters-24-ngos-401334,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7321013/,https://www.wionews.com/world/nicaragua-parliament-shutters-24-ngos-401334,https://havanatimes.org/features/nicaraguan-mds-silence-or-exile-after-murillos-threats/,https://www.confidencial.com.ni/english/doctors-face-silence-or-exile-after-rosario-murillos-threats/,https://havanatimes.org/features/nicaragua-ortega-regime-targets-24-ngos/,//https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-arrests-nicaragua-aff0b7b11ed10091f8bb2e62a3412240,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210810-nicaraguan-ex-diplomat-becomes-32nd-critic-arrested-by-ortega,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/14/nicaraguan-police-raid-opposition-newspaper-la-prensa,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/14/nicaragua-police-arrest-editor-of-newspaper-critical-of-ortega,https://www.vozdeamerica.com/nicaragua/eurodiputada-rodriguez-seguir-llamandolo-elecciones-es-contribuir-esta-farsa,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210811-nicaragua-opposition-leader-flees-to-costa-rica-to-avoid-detention,https://www.dw.com/en/nicaragua-main-opposition-party-barred-from-presidential-elections/a-58788696,https://www.state.gov/the-lack-of-prospects-for-free-and-fair-election-in-nicaragua/,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/08/02/nicaragua-eu-imposes-sanctions-on-eight-more-individuals/,https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-nicaragua-c8e577f37d0294443a4f4eb98e388af0,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/08/05/new-eu-sanctions-nicaraguan-officials-amid-escalating-crisis,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaraguan-government-cancels-registration-six-foreign-ngos-2021-08-16/;Ortega’s Groundless Attack on Humanitarian, Democracy Groups in Nicaragua;;;;;;

Each individual was fined $500, and they were ordered to jointly pay $100,000 in damages to the Cambodia Border Affairs Committee.On July 21, 2020, Rong Chhun had issued a statement alleging the placement of border posts resulted in Cambodian farmers losing ancestral land to Vietnam in Ponhea Kraek district, Tbong Khmum province.Rong Chhun, president of the Cambodian Confederation of Unions, uses a megaphone during a protest near the prime minister's residence in Phnom Penh on July 29, 2020. (Heng Sinith/AP)That, authorities said, was incitement. Chhun received the maximum allowable sentence under the law, sparking a flurry of condemnation from rights groups.Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin replied:“The legal procedures brought against [Chhun] were not due to his exercise of freedom of speech but because he had committed a crime. The authorities had a strong legal basis and evidence to bring the case to court and it led to these penalties.”That is misleading.In fact, Chhun is just the latest victim of Cambodia’s suppression of speech and civic participation under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen, an autocrat who’s been in power since 1985.In Cambodia and beyond, Chhun’s arrest and sentencing is largely viewed as politically motivated. Top diplomats condemned the sentence, including the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, Patrick Murphy.“The conviction of respected union leader Rong Chhun raises serious questions about freedom of speech protected in Cambodia’s constitution and essential to the functioning of a democracy,” Murphy said on Twitter. “The judicial system should not be abused to silence peaceful activists.”Tina Redshaw, U.K. ambassador to Cambodia, echoed Murphy.“Freedom of expression is protected in Cambodia’s Constitution, and the judiciary shouldn’t be used to curtail it. Strong governments are open to hearing and engaging with a range of views from all of society,” she tweeted.Chhun had weighed in on a sensitive issue in Cambodia: Enforcement of borders with the country’s historic enemy and neighbor, Vietnam. Some Cambodians in Ponhea Kraek claimed that Vietnamese were encroaching on their land.On July 31, 2020, the Cambodia Border Affairs Committee claimed Chhun’s complaints about border posts disseminated “fake news” intended to cause social unrest and public misunderstanding.Chhun, the committee said, had “colluded with bad actors who claimed their ancestral land was taken by Vietnamese soldiers who ousted them from their farms.”Kuy Pisey, vice president of the Cambodia Border Committee, told VOA’s sister organization Radio Free Asia (RFA) that the border is “based on documentation,” and that the farmers there had never controlled (or lost) the land.Chhun, contested the committee’s characterization of his statements on the matter, as well as their conclusions. “It is the truth, based on the villagers who said they lost around 500 meters (1,640 feet) of their land to the border … The border committee must be brave enough to accept the truth,” he told RFA.Chhun was arrested the following day, August 1. Shortly afterward, 142 Cambodian civil society groups, communities and unions called on the government to drop all charges against him.The Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights called Chhun’s arrest “a clear violation of the unionist’s right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Cambodia’s constitution.”New York-based Human Rights Watch concurred. “Prime Minister Hun Sen should stop muzzling labor unionists, human rights defenders, and other critics of government policies,” said Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy Asia director.Kanika and Nimol were arrested while protesting for Chhun’s release outside of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court in August 2020.Following the verdicts, Chak Sopheap, Executive Director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, said the conviction and sentencing of all three men “forms part of a broader pattern of systemic silencing of dissenting or critical voices by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC).”“The judicial harassment that they have faced — for legitimately exercising their fundamental freedoms — exemplifies the RGC's growing intolerance to criticism,” she said.Rong Chhun is also a member of the Cambodia Watchdog Council, and a former member of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), the main opposition party, which was banned in November 2017. The party’s leadership was summarily targeted and convicted on what HRW Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson called “bogus charges.”The overall climate for speech and civil rights has worsened in Cambodia. The rights group Freedom House classifies the country as “not free” and a de facto one-party state. U.K.-based Amnesty International reported in January that 150 people affiliated with the CNRP are facing jail on charges that include treason and incitement.In a new strike against press freedom, Cambodia’s Ministry of Information in late July announced it was creating a “Monitoring Committee for Journalism Ethics” to “provide guidance to journalists who violate professional ethics and adjust their performance accordingly.”Daniel Bastard, the head of journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders’ Asia-Pacific desk, called the committee “a new tool of censorship and intimidation that Prime Minister Hun Sen's government is deploying in order to silence any media outlets that dare to question its policies.”RSF’s 2020 World Press Freedom Index, which rates the media environment in 180 countries and territories, placed Cambodia toward the bottom (144th).In April 2020, Cambodia introduced state-of-emergency powers ostensibly to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, but which rights groups say have been broadly used to snuff out free speech, particularly criticism of the government.As previously reported by Polygraph.info and others, journalists have been jailed for incitement and other charges for criticizing Hun Sen’s plan to name his son as his successor; the government debt-relief efforts during the pandemic; reports on a land dispute involving the military; and even repeating Hun Sen’s own comments.In one egregious case, a 14-year-old girl was arrested for expressing fears about coronavirus circulating at her school on social media.";https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/verdict-08182021171607.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/arrest-07312020163614.html,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/chhun-sentenced-two-years,https://pressocm.gov.kh/archives/66755,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/arrest-07312020163614.html,https://www.licadho-cambodia.org/pressrelease.php?perm=459,https://www.ticambodia.org/drop-all-charges-against-arrested-union-leader-rong-chhun/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/04/cambodia-free-prominent-trade-union-leader,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-cambodia-coup-case-verdict/31136250.html,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/ethics-committee-scrutinise-work-media-instruct-best-practices,https://rsf.org/en/news/cambodia-use-ethics-committee-censor-journalists,https://rsf.org/en/cambodia,https://www.asiapacific.ca/asia-watch/cambodias-free-speech-covid-19-casualty,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-hun-sen-press-freedom/31241557.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/10/cambodia-reporter-jailed-quoting-hun-sen-covid-19,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cambodia-arrests/cambodia-uses-coronavirus-crisis-to-arrest-17-critics-rights-group-says-idUSKBN21B0JJ;Cambodia’s Misleading Excuse for Trampling Free Speech;;;;;;
163;;;;Misleading;Sergey Lavrov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/doubletalk-from-russian-fm-on-foreign-troops-in-libya/6743112.html;Doublespeak from Russian FM on Foreign Troops in Libya;2021-08-23;polygraph;;"On August 19, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke at a joint news conference with Najla Mangoush, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Libya’s Government of National Unity. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, a reporter asked: “What is the status of implementing the agreement on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Libya, since Turkey is reluctant to discuss this issue, and the other parties refuse to even recognize their presence in Libya?” Lavrov denied that Turkey and other parties had refused to discuss the issue of troop withdrawals, saying the matter had been raised at the Second Berlin Conference on Libya held June 23.""The withdrawal of these troops must necessarily take place and this process has to be organized step by step,” Lavrov said according to the state owned TASS news agency “This is the main thing, and not the attempts to divert the discussion into a talk about the legitimate and illegitimate forces there."" That is misleading. It is true that the Second Berlin Conference on Libya highlighted the need to remove foreign troops from that country. As Germany’s Foreign Ministry said in a press release on the conclusions of the conference: “All foreign forces and mercenaries need to be withdrawn from Libya without delay, and the security sector reformed and placed firmly under unified, civilian authority and oversight.”Of note: the word “mercenaries.” Lavrov pointedly failed to mention the private Russian troops who’ve been involved in the Libyan conflict since 2019, fighting on the side of the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar against the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord. That explains why Lavrov spoke of “attempts to divert the discussion towards discussing certain players’ legitimacy or lack of it” – because the Russian presence is controversial. The Wagner “private military company” (PMC) presence has been known and reported on since 2018. Most recently, BBC on August 11 published a new investigation detailing the extent of Wagner’s operations and backing up claims that its soldiers may have been involved in crimes against Libyan civilians. The BBC also found further evidence that Wagner is deeply tied to the Russian government, despite official denials. Wagner’s ties to the Russian Ministry of Defense aren’t new.Officially, private military companies have no legal standing in Russia. Wagner, however, was allowed to use Russian military training facilities and took part in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. The company gained more attention for operating alongside the Russian military in Syria. Although Wagner is on paper a private company, its owner, the restaurateur and caterer Yevgeny Prigozhin, reportedly has close ties to President Vladimir Putin and contracts with Russia’s military. Besides Ukraine, Syria, and Libya, Wagner mercenaries have also been involved in conflicts in the Central African Republic and Mozambique.Vasily Kudrichev (r), Wagner PMC mercenary, who died in Syria, in Deir ez-Zor battle on February 7, 2018, pictured in Chechnya.The BBC managed to acquire a Samsung tablet that belonged to a Wagner mercenary in Libya that contained information about the group’s activities in that country. Libyan intelligence services also provided the British outlet with a “shopping list” that included a wide variety of high-tech, Russian-made weapons and equipment used by the soldiers for hire. The BBC interviewed witnesses who alleged that Wagner mercenaries had killed villagers and executed soldiers who had surrendered.This is not the first time Wagner mercenaries have been accused of war crimes. In late June, the United Nations released a report on crimes allegedly committed by Wagner mercenaries working with the armed forces of the Central African Republic.The Kremlin has categorically denied the war crimes accusations.In October 2020, negotiators in Geneva brokered a ceasefire agreement to end fighting between the Government of National Accord and Haftar’s opposition movement. Under this agreement, foreign forces backing both sides were to be removed.Earlier this year, however, there were signs that Russia’s mercenaries might stay. CNN reported in January that Wagner forces had built a large trench, spanning nearly 70 kilometers, from the town of Sirte south to the Al Jufra airbase. The trench appeared to be part of a system of defensive fortifications and could be seen in satellite photos.In late April, the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Laboratory found open-source evidence suggesting that Wagner mercenaries, who according to the ceasefire deal were supposed to leave Libya within 90 days after January 1, 2021, remained in Libya past that deadline. Moreover, the lab claimed it had seen evidence that additional Wagner mercenaries may have been sent to Libya in early February.Citing anonymous “sources on the ground,” the Turkish Daily Sabah claimed in April that 300 additional Russian mercenaries would be sent to Libya.On July 24, the U.S. Department of Defense published a report claiming that Wagner mercenaries were still active in Libya. The report included satellite imagery showing Russian military equipment on airfields.";https://www.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/international_safety/conflicts/-/asset_publisher/xIEMTQ3OvzcA/content/id/4842045,https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/newsroom/news/berlin-2-conclusions/2467750,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-58009514,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-mercenaries-in-syria/29057392.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlin-falsely-dismisses-u-n-atrocity-accusations-as-another-lie-/31334451.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/19/in-push-for-africa-russias-wagner-mercenaries-are-out-of-their-depth-in-mozambique-a68220,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-58009514,https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlin-falsely-dismisses-u-n-atrocity-accusations-as-another-lie-/31334451.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54660039,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/22/africa/libya-trench-russia-intl/index.html,https://medium.com/dfrlab/suspect-claims-of-wagner-mercenaries-withdrawing-from-libya-27ab71764e60,https://www.dailysabah.com/world/africa/russian-wagner-group-to-send-300-syrian-fighters-to-libya,https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2287821/russia-wagner-group-continue-military-involvement-in-libya/;Doublespeak from Russian FM on Foreign Troops in Libya;;;;;;

Lukashenko’s Rant About Airline Sanctions;2021-08-20;polygraph;;"On August 16, the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported on a conversation President Alexander Lukashenko had with Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Sivak and Transport and Communications Minister Alexey Avramenko. The topic: European Union sanctions on the state air carrier, Belavia.“Belarus is a transit country, and you must do your best to ensure the normal operation of the transport industry,” Belta quoted Lukashenko as telling his subordinates.The rest of the Belta article was mostly mundane – until the end, when it quoted Lukashenko quote as saying:“Starting from Belavia, when those crazy people [abroad] started to stifle our company. Now we know why.”While the context is a little fuzzy, it seems clear that Lukashenko was lashing out at the EU for banning Belavia flights to member countries – clearly an economic hit.Whatever the case, his insinuation that sanctions are “crazy” is false, given that, in May, Belarusian authorities effectively hijacked a passenger jet belonging to the Irish carrier Ryanair. The plane, which was flying from Athens to Vilnius, was forced down while passing through Belarusian airspace.Air traffic controllers at Minsk International Airport told the Ryanair pilots a false story about receiving a bomb threat against the flight and ordered them to land.The airliner, which had nearly reached the Lithuanian border, was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet, at which point it changed course and headed for Minsk.After it landed, Belarusian authorities arrested Belarusian dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen. Pratasevich was paraded on Belarusian state TV; he remains under house arrest after being released from prison.The Belta article did not report any of those details.Before being banned by the EU, Belavia flew to 20 European airports. In June, the EU ordered member states to “deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers.” The sanctions hit other Belarusian industries, including the makers of trucks, fertilizer and cigarettes. Analysts lowered their estimates for Belarus’ 2021 GDP growth.Lukashenko has been on a tear, jailing or deporting political opponents since declaring himself the victor in disputed 2020 elections. That outcome triggered huge protests and international condemnation.";https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/06/04/eu-bans-belarusian-carriers-from-its-airspace-and-airports/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/belarus-put-on-notice-of-sanctions-over-hijack-of-ryanair-flight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/belarus-blogger-roman-protasevich-minsk-ryanair,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/belarus-raman-pratasevich-forced-televised-confession-amounts-to-ill-treatment/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-ban-belarus-overflights-midnight-diplomats-say-2021-06-04/,https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-sanctions-belarus-companies/31326064.html,http://www.fitchsolutions.com/country-risk/eu-sanctions-belarus-drag-growth-2021-longer-term-outlook-deteriorates-22-06-2021,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/07/23/belarus-authorities-launch-purge-civic-groups;Who’s ‘Crazy’?

He claims to have been inspired by a similar petition from “Chinese netizens” organized by China’s state-run Global Times newspaper. Writing in the Manila Times newspaper, pro-Beijing columnist Mauro Gia Samonte approvingly cited various conspiracy theories that Laurel spread regarding Fort Detrick, including “the early presence of a ‘strange flu’ in other countries and the mysterious issues such as the ‘vaping deaths’ emanating from the US around the middle of 2019.”Samonte claimed that “[b]ecause of impulsive media accounts, largely explained by the hard-line anti-Chinese stance taken by US President Donald Trump during the US presidential campaign, the initial reported outbreak of the killer pathogen in Wuhan placed China as the culprit for the pandemic.”He added: “Credible accounts, however, have zeroed in on Fort Detrick as the real origin.”In fact, there is no credible evidence that the virus behind the pandemic came from Fort Detrick – but much evidence that China has spread this unfounded speculation.Samonte’s claims, and those made by Laurel, largely rehash previously debunked conspiracy theories. China’s attempts to deflect attention about the origin question only intensified after the World Health Organization chief called for another round of investigations. COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.In answer to questions from Polygraph.info, Laurel said that he and others calling for an investigation of Fort Detrick are solely incentivized ""by our interest in searching for the truth and the facts.""Among other things, Fort Detrick researches pathogens that cause such dangerous diseases as Ebola and tularemia. Competing conspiracy theories, disputed by China, suggest the coronavirus behind the pandemic may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which researched similar viruses from Chinese bats. U.S. grants helped pay for some of WIV's research.What’s new here is that disinformation from a handful of marginal, pro-Beijing ""Philippines influencers” is being amplified by Chinese media to sow more doubt about Fort Detrick. Only a few hundred people have signed on to the petition campaign in the Philippines. Screen capture of the petition posted to Change.org by Global Talk News Radio, calling on the World Health Organization to the U.S. biolabs at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries outside of China.Samonte’s reference to “the early presence of a ‘strange flu’ in other countries” apparently refers to claims that SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus behind COVID-19, was present in Europe and the United States prior to the December 2019 outbreak in Wuhan.One such report said the virus was detected in Barcelona wastewater in March 2019. However, those scientists released a second study in March 2021 showing that the sewage samples had tested positive were actually collected no earlier than January 2020.Meantime, Chinese state media have repeatedly cited a study by Italy’s National Cancer Institute (INT), which, according to the Reuters news service, found that 11.6% of 959 asymptomatic individuals enrolled in a lung cancer screening trial between September 2019 and March 2020 had developed coronavirus antibodies. The first blood samples for that trial were taken months before the virus was detected in Wuhan. But an important point is that researchers in the Italian study said their findings did not refute that the virus originated in China. Instead, they could “document that the epidemic in China was not detected in time,” said INT scientific director Giovanni Apolone.This did not stop China’s state-run CGTN network from baselessly claiming in an editorial that the presence of three U.S. military bases in Northern Italy “adds more fuel to the fire of the Fort Detrick claims.”Like Chinese state media and diplomats, Samonte also cited March 2020 comments by Robert Redfield, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about the Fort Detrick conspiracy theory. United States Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) personnel at Fort Detrick on December 4, 2020. (Ellen Crown/U.S. Army Handout via Reuters)In testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Oversight and Reform in March 2020, then-CDC director Redfield stated that some deaths initially attributed to the flu were actually caused by COVID-19. Redfield provided no details, including when this misattribution took place, and did not refer to Fort Detrick.Likewise, Samonte raised the case of Michael Melham, the mayor of Belleville, New Jersey, who in late April 2020 tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. Melham, who had experienced flu-like symptoms in November 2019, attributed those symptoms to COVID-19 without evidence.Following the lead of Chinese state media, Samonte insinuated that a rash of deaths related to e-cigarettes were actually caused by undiagnosed COVID-19. Maryland was among a number of states that recorded at least 50 hospitalizations and/or deaths from e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI).Scientific studies have clearly shown a strong correlation between Vitamin E acetate, an additive in some vaping products, and EVALI. The CDC said the removal of E acetate from many vaping products, a crackdown on black-market products, and increased public awareness contributed to a drop in EVALI cases.Samonte further echoed the Global Times by attempting to link Fort Detrick with a rash of illnesses at a Virginia retirement community some 60 miles away from the U.S. Army facility.Proponents of the Fort Detrick conspiracy theory have long noted that research at the lab was halted in August 2019 after employees of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USMRIID) raised safety concerns. A CDC inspection uncovered two containment breaches. But no exposures or leaks were reported at the facility, and the lab reopened in 2020.The Philippines petition calling for an investigation into Fort Detrick itself appears to be of questionable origin. While at last count only generating 532 signatures from August 5 to August 11, Chinese state media extensively covered the petition.A China Daily article described the campaign as having been organized by Manila-based Global Talk News Radio. Global Talk News Radio only broadcasts on the internet every Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and every Sunday on AM radio from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.Laurel is identified as a Global Talk News Radio host. Global Times said that Laurel and his colleagues at an NGO called Philippine-BRICS Strategic Studies (Phil-BRICS) decided to push for the investigation of Fort Detrick “as early as the second half of 2020.”Phil-BRICS describes itself as “a registered non-profit organization dedicated to promoting global multi-polarity and Philippine leadership in global peace and prosperity advocacy.” Phil-BRICS, however, appears to be just a blog hosted on a free platform. Laurel is the only individual cited on the author’s page.Phil-BRICS has printed or reprinted articles by Samonte and Ado Paglinawan, the editor in chief of Sovereignph.com, a minor online news portal, among others.China’s state-run Xinhua news agency referred to Laurel as “a columnist for social news website Sovereign P.H,” and has cited Paglinawan without mentioning his connection to Sovereign P.H.Phil-BRICS organized a Zoom forum to launch Paglinawan’s book, “No Vaccine for a Virus Called Racism,” to correspond with the launch of the Global Talk News Radio petition.Polygraph.info reached out to Laurel to determine the extent of his role in managing Global Talk News Radio and Phil-BRICS, as well as the petition. We further asked if Phil-BRICS is registered as a non-profit with the Philippines Securities And Exchange Commission.Laurel confirmed he was the brainchild for the petition.""I initiated the Petition to [the] WHO for the opening of investigations on Ft. Detrick and persuaded my colleagues, especially Ado Paglinawan who had already written and published his book, and I campaigned among my colleagues in the Phil-BRICS to write about the issues,"" he said.Laurel said Phil-BRICS ""is composed of writers, columnists, retired government and military officials, all of whom write in various newspapers here.""He added that Phil-BRICS is a self-funded, online project with no full-time staff or rented office space, though he says it receives small contributions from supporters and tech help from two engineering students.Both Phil-BRICS and Global Talk News Radio are essentially projects run out of Laurel's home, he said, largely at his own expense.On June 29, Laurel and Pangiliwan were named as laureates of the Award for Promoting Philippines-China Understanding (APPCU) for 2021. The awards were given at a ceremony on August 6 at the Chinese Embassy in Manila.Laurel was called “a major figure in fair and accurate reporting about the realities between the Philippines and China, as well as the global vision of China to build a better world for all peoples and the nations.”Screen capture from the Facebook page of Global Talk News Radio, congratulating its host Herman Laurel for becoming a laureate of the Award for Promoting Philippines-China Understanding (APPCU) for 2021 on August 7, 2021.Laurel told Polygraph.info the APPCU award was an NGO project launched in 1975 when formal diplomatic relations were established between China and the Philippines.""The current and first awards went to the likes of former First Lady Imelda R. Marcos and Amb. Francis Chua, and eight others to include me and Paglinawan, hence it can not be construed as a reward for any particular reason but a broad, general and even historical performance,"" he said.""I think the U.S. and China should work together for a better world. China has consistently taken a passive and defensive stance to the U.S. State’s aggressive approach,"" Laurel said. ""We in ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) want peace and prosperity –– geography conditions us to desire harmony and cooperation with China. Please help your State listen.""";http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/06/c_1310111419.htm,http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0807/c90000-9881351.html,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-08-07/Philippine-influencers-call-for-probe-into-U-S-Fort-Detrick-biolab-12wLvX7R1ug/index.html,https://hermantiulaurel2015.blogspot.com/p/about-author.html,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1230352.shtml,https://www.polygraph.info/a/gain-of-function-coronavirus-wuhan-china/31374237.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain-science/coronavirus-traces-found-in-march-2019-sewage-sample-spanish-study-shows-idUSKBN23X2HQ,https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.02750-20,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-italy-timing/researchers-find-coronavirus-was-circulating-in-italy-earlier-than-thought-idUSKBN27W1J2,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-italy-china/researchers-say-study-on-covid-19-in-italy-doesnt-dispute-virus-origins-idUKKBN27Z2QQ,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-08-01/N-Italy-coronavirus-and-U-S-military-bases-Just-a-coincidence--12mYLBEBMQM/index.html,https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/LC65593/text?s=1&r=82,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/05/c_139032713.htm,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/essex/belleville/2020/04/30/belleville-nj-mayor-tests-positive-coronavirus-antibodies/3057925001/,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/essex/belleville/2020/04/30/belleville-nj-mayor-tests-positive-coronavirus-antibodies/3057925001/,https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1181292.shtml,https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#epi-chartEVALI,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1916433,https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#epi-chart,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-disinfo-covid-19/30647619.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/04/01/cdc-lifts-shutdown-order-army-biolabs-fort-detrick.html,https://www.change.org/p/world-health-organization-probefortdetrick?utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=custom_url&recruited_by_id=4c757390-f40d-11eb-b80f-1bbc5984b4a5,http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0807/c90000-9881351.html,https://philbrics.wordpress.com/authors/,https://philbrics.wordpress.com/2020/10/10/us-faking-military-aircraft-as-civilian-a-crime-against-humanity/,https://philbrics.wordpress.com/2020/07/28/weighing-war-zones-pinocchio-bases-in-subic-the-us-pn-chief-say-yes-but-du30-and-dnd-disagree/,https://sovereignph.com/,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/asiapacific/2021-08/06/c_1310111419.htm,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1145392;China Outsources Fort Detrick Pandemic Conspiracy To Philippines;;;;;;
166;;;;False;Russian Foreign Ministry;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-havana-syndrome-russia-lies/6743097.html;Havana Syndrome, Microwave Weapons, Russian Lies;2021-08-11;polygraph;;"On August 6, U.S. security and intelligence officials met in Washington, D.C., to boost an interagency investigation of the so-called “anomalous health incidents” (AHI) that have been reported by hundreds of U.S. government officials and their families worldwide.Hosted by the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, the Joint Intelligence Community Council said it is a “top priority to identify the cause of AHI, provide the highest level of care to those affected, and prevent such incidents from continuing.”First reported by the American and Canadian diplomats stationed in Havana, Cuba, in 2016, the health incidents are popularly known as Havana Syndrome. Victims have reported a sudden illness with symptoms that include headaches, vertigo, disorientation, ringing in the ears, loss of vision and hearing. In some cases, brain damage and long-term illness were reported.More recently, U.S. personnel in China, Russia, the U.K. and, last month, Vienna, Austria, have reported similar symptoms.A U.S. State Department task force investigated after the initial Havana reports. In September 2018, Ambassador Peter Rode, who led that effort, told the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee that the department had “come to the determination that they were attacks.”Evidence “based on communication intercepts” suggests that Russia is behind these attacks, NBC reported, citing U.S. intelligence sources. Officials have long suspected that some type of microwave or electromagnetic device could have been used to target the workers.In Russia, state officials and top lawmakers have met the U.S. reports about the Havana Syndrome and suspected Russian involvement with denials and mockery.Russian officials and state media have claimed that speculation about Russia’s knowledge or use of microwave weaponry or similar technology is fake, invented by “aging mentally unstable Russophobes,” and that the mysterious symptoms are more likely the result of “hangovers.”On August 5, Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency quoted Aleksandr Bikantov, deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s media office:“The Russophobic agitprop continues to propagate fakes. We sympathize with our colleagues and wish them good health. We believe that it is immoral and low to launch anti-Russian speculations, citing ailments. Fictions about some psi rays are beyond common sense.”That claim is false. Although the cause of Havana Syndrome remains a matter of debate, evidence pointing to Russia’s weapons capability is more than mere speculation or science fiction. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, defense ministry, top military developers and experts all have hinted at or boasted about electromagnetic weapons.[Note: Microwaves, like gamma rays, x-rays and radio waves, are a form of electromagnetic radiation.]In March 2018, Putin said in his annual address to parliament that Russia “has all reasons to believe that we are a step ahead” of other countries in creating “prospective weapons based on new physical principles.” Putin said it was too early to reveal the details, but that “specialists will understand” what he meant for Russia’s defense capabilities.In October of that year, the Kremlin-controlled RT (Russia Today) news agency reported that “weapons based on new physical principles” referred to “SVCh-weapons.” “SVCh” is the Russian abbreviation for microwave.The RT report said this class of electromagnetic weapons could destroy or temporarily incapacitate an enemy’s machinery and computers, and was also harmful to humans, causing a “degradation of the nervous and immune systems as well as metabolic failures.”RT cited a representative of the Russian “Koncern Radio Electronic Technologies,” KRET, a major Russian defense contractor.In November 2018, Zvezda, the Russia’s defense ministry’s official news channel, reported that the Russian army had been testing electromagnetic weapons both “in the lab and in the field.” Both the RT and Zvezda reports focused on “SVCh-cannons,” artillery and rockets.The TASS state news agency reported in October 2018 that the SVCh weapons could be harmful to the soldiers operating them, and that the defense ministry had devised ways to isolate operators.“Today we already have SVCh weapon models which can work with precision on machinery and human targets,” TASS quoted Air Force Gen. Vladimir Popov as saying. According to the news agency, Popov said that now is not the time to “show all the cards” because ""there may be, you know, people who will say that these are not humane means of waging war. And on the other hand, they will say that here again we have taken a step towards another arms race.”In July 2020, the Russian defense ministry’s research and special projects department declared a “breakthrough” in microwave weapons development, announcing it was funding and coordinating “field-research” in SVCh-weaponry, military robotics, hypersonic weapons and biotechnology as the “military confrontation between states spilled over into the military science and military technology.”The Kremlin website’s archives of Russian government and Russian Security Council meetings with the president include several mentions of SVCh weapons technology. In the earliest, dated March 19, 2007, then-defense minister Sergei Ivanov reported to Putin that the development of “SVCh-electronics has been effectively launched,” and “not only for military but for civilian use as well.”In November 2013, during an unclassified portion of a meeting on Russia’s defense and space developments, Pavel Sozinov, constructor-general of the state-owned Almaz-Antey arms manufacturer, told Putin: “Those new electronic technologies I’ve mentioned earlier” are “unfolding.” Asked by Putin when they would start being produced for sale, Sozinov answered “in 2016.”A book written by a team of Russian experts and published in 2009, titled “Parallel weaponry, or with what and how killing will be done in the 21st Century,” reported that the former Soviet Union launched a SVCh-weapons program in 1977, with the first models created by 1982.According to the book, a Soviet commission ultimately killed the big weaponry part of the project but nonetheless found that precision SVCh weapons were very effective against telecommunication systems. “Thus, the new direction has emerged and has been successfully developing since, that is the use of SVCH-weapons to cause functional harm,” the book says.The U.S. National Security Agency reportedly has evidence that at least one country possesses microwave weapons.In September 2018, The New York Times obtained and released an NSA memo from 2014. In it the agency confirmed, based on 2012 intelligence, that an unnamed “hostile country” was in a possession of “a high-powered microwave system weapon that may have the ability to weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time and without leaving evidence.”“This weapon is designed to bathe a target’s living quarters in microwaves, causing numerous physical effects, including a damaged nervous system,” the NSA memo stated.The Times report said several countries, including the U.S., China and Russia, have been developing microwave weapons, but that Russia was the most likely culprit behind the attacks against the American officials in Havana. That conclusion was based on an analysis of the travel logs of the Russian intelligence operatives prior to and during the Havana attacks. The Times interviewed American scientist Allan H. Frey, whose research papers on the topic published in 1960s drew much attention from the Soviets.“Not long after his initial discoveries, Mr. Frey said, he was invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to visit and lecture,” the Times reported. “Toward the end, in a surprise, he was taken outside Moscow to a military base surrounded by armed guards and barbed-wire fences.”“ 'They had me visiting the various labs and discussing the problems,' including the neural impacts of microwaves, Mr. Frey recalled.”Initially, U.S. intelligence and other officials viewed the Havana Syndrome reports with skepticism, and an early FBI investigation dismissed the “attack” theory, according to news reports.The FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit’s initial investigation concluded that the “Havana patients” were suffering from a “mass psychogenic illness” – “a condition in which a group of people, often thinking that they have been exposed to something dangerous, begin to feel sick at the same time.”But with the newly reported cases, the FBI is now “reassessing” its conclusion, The New Yorker reported in July, citing an unnamed U.S. official.A 2020 book, “Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria” by Robert W. Baloh, professor at the UCLA School of Medicine, and Robert E. Bartholomew, medical sociologist and author in New Zealand, fueled skepticism about a weapons attack.Its authors claimed that the American and Canadian diplomats in Cuba had mistaken the “mating calls of insects for a sonic weapon,” causing a collective stress response.Critics say the book is flawed, noting that the Havana Syndrome has been reported in places and seasons with no mating insects. Also, the victims did not always know what symptoms others were experiencing. (In an email to Polygraph.info, Bartholomew disputed this and said the finding of mass psychogenic illness was only for the Havana reports.)As to the Russians’ mocking “hangover” claims? In fact, the Havana Syndrome symptoms are real and unusual, scientists concluded.A multidisciplinary medical examination of Havana Syndrome victims published by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences in 2018 found that they had suffered from “persistent cognitive, vestibular, and oculomotor dysfunction, as well as sleep impairment and headaches.”“These individuals appeared to have sustained injury to widespread brain networks without an associated history of head trauma,” the report said.Another National Academies of Sciences report in 2020 reached two conclusions: the reported syndrome was both unique and credibly consistent with electromagnetic wave exposure.“First, the committee found a constellation of acute clinical signs and symptoms with directional and location-specific features that was distinctive; to its knowledge, this constellation of clinical features is unlike any disorder in the neurological or general medical literature...”“Second, after considering the information available to it and a set of possible mechanisms, the committee felt that many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms, and observations reported by DOS employees are consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy. Studies published in the open literature more than a half century ago and over the subsequent decades by Western and Soviet sources provide circumstantial support for this possible mechanism.”-- Correction: The initial fact check inaccurately described Baloh's and Bartholomew's findings, which apply only to the original Havana reports. The authors attributed those symptoms to mass psychogenic illness, a collective stress response, not to mass psychosis.

167;;;;False;Narendra Singh Tomar;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-india-farmers-protests-deaths/6743094.html;Indian Ag Minister Claims No Protesting Farmers Died – Except That Hundreds Did;2021-08-10;polygraph;;On July 22, the Indian Lok Sabha (House of the People) held its monsoon parliamentary session and took up discussion of three controversial agricultural laws that have sparked continued protests by farmers, who say they could be squeezed out of business. The laws date to September 2020. Supporters said they were a much-needed update of government-controlled, subsidized farm markets, known as mandis, that have operated for decades. Instead, owners of small farms said the laws favored big agriculture. Among other things, the reforms freed farmers to sell directly to other states and buyers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party insist the laws will revolutionize the country’s agricultural sector. But some 86 percent of India’s farmland is controlled by small farmers, who fear exploitation and have turned to protests. Since last November, some 100,000 farmers, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the borders of New Delhi to demand repeal of the BJP-backed farm laws. The protesters include children, women and the elderly. The government and 40 farm union leaders who represent the thousands of protesters held close to a dozen meetings until talks reached an impasse in January. Against that backdrop, Indian Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar was asked on July 22 about hundreds of farmers who reportedly died while protesting. The reply: “The government of India has no record of farmers having died or fallen ill during the ongoing protests over the Centre’s farm laws.” That is false. According to the Indian Express, the state government of Punjab, where a majority of the protesters are from, verified 220 deaths of farmers and farm laborers. The state subsequently provided around $1.5 million in compensation to the kin of the deceased. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of farmer unions, reported that 400 deaths have occurred. The Punjab government is still verifying many. Most deaths have been due to heart attacks, illnesses, suicides or accidents coming to and from the protest. On February 14, the agriculture minister of Haryana, Jai Prakash Dalal, acknowledged the deaths but claimed “the 200 farmers who died during the ongoing protests would have died anywhere.” Several farmers’ unions and opposition politicians deemed that comment as insensitive. Dalal is a member of Modi's majority BJP. The protest garnered attention for its longevity and for including people of all religions and genders. Women as old as 90 have been at the forefront of the movement, despite attempts by the government to persuade them to go home. Oxfam India reports that 85% of women in rural India work in agriculture, yet only 13% of them own land.The demonstration turned violent on January 26, India’s Republic Day, when farmers clashed with police and forced their way into the main city of New Delhi. One protester died and several hundred policemen and farmers were injured. The Modi government's treatment of the demonstrators also brought to light India's growing authoritarianism. A recent TIME magazine article was among reports noting rising press censorship, detention of journalists and internet blackouts. Some establishment media houses have discredited protesters as “anti-national extremists,” TIME reported. On February 5, the United Nations human rights office expressed concern via Twitter: “We call on the authorities and protesters to exercise maximum restraint in ongoing #FarmersProtests. The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It's crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all.” In February, Rajat Khosla, senior director of research, advocacy and policy at Amnesty International, accused India’s government of suppressing dissent: “We have seen an alarming escalation in the Indian authorities’ targeting of anyone who dares to criticize or protest the government’s repressive laws and policies.” In March, Dr. Swaiman Singh, a 34-year-old Indian-American cardiologist from New Jersey, told CNN that he left a thriving career and “literally perfect” life to provide free medical care to the protesters. An image of someone incorrectly performing CPR on a protester added to Singh’s determination, he told the network. Singh and his team arrived in India last November and transformed an abandoned complex into a community clinic. In an interview with the Voice of America, Singh claimed that Agriculture Minister Tomar’s comment made him realize that “India has very little value for human life, and the politicians thrive on money and power.” He said the minister should at least visit the farmers and see their plight first-hand before making such comments. Singh said that if a similar situation erupted in the United States, the outcome and empathy level would be completely different. The Supreme Court of India has issued an “indefinite stay” on implementation of the farm laws and pledged to form a committee to take up the farmers’ demands, Reuters reported. While expressing gratitude, the farmers’ unions remain unfazed and are demanding repeal of the reform laws. On August 6, Rahul Gandhi, the leader of Indian National Congress, the country’s main opposition party, and 12 other opposition party leaders, visited the farmers’ “parliament” or Kisan Sansad, in the heart of New Delhi. Since late July, the farmers have been protesting closer to the Indian parliament. Gandhi expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers. Neither Prime Minister Modi nor Agriculture Minister Tomar have visited any of the protest sites in the months since the protests started.;https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/asia/india-farm-law-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/12/1/why-are-thousands-of-indian-farmers-protesting ,https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/indian-farmers-weather-eight-month-protest-highway,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-record-of-deaths-during-ongoing-agitation-against-farm-laws-centre-to-lok-sabha-1830594-2021-07-21,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/as-centre-says-no-record-220-deaths-during-ongoing-farm-protests-reveals-punjab-govt-data-7420061/ ,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmer-deaths-they-would-have-died-anywhere-says-haryana-agriculture-minister-in-controversial-remarks-211974 ,https://time.com/5942125/women-india-farmers-protests/,https://www.oxfamindia.org/women-empowerment-india-farmers ,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55817628,https://time.com/5938041/india-farmer-protests-democracy/ ,https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1357710206612946944 ,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/india-government-must-stop-crushing-farmers-protests-and-demonizing-dissenters/ ,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/india/india-farmers-protests-doctor-swaiman-singh-trnd/index.html ,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests/indias-top-court-orders-stay-on-new-farm-laws-that-riled-growers-idUSKBN29H0UL ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-leaders-attend-farmers-protest/article35773877.ece ;Indian Ag Minister Claims No Protesting Farmers Died – Except That Hundreds Did;;;;;;

The ship, an asphalt-hauling cargo vessel known as the Asphalt Princess, was traveling from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates when it reportedly was boarded by eight or nine armed individuals near the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz. According to The Drive news site, British Royal Navy authorities reported the incident as a “non-piracy” incident, which they later upgraded to a “potential hijacking.” The alleged hijackers reportedly later left the ship to continue on its journey.The incident followed a recent drone attack on the tanker Mercer Street, which killed two of that ship’s crew. Afterward, explosive experts from the USS Ronald Reagan collected remnants of the drones, and investigators later concluded they came from Iran.The day after the attempted hijacking, Iran’s state-owned Press TV published a story denying Iranian involvement, dismissing it as “psychological warfare” by the United States and its allies. The story quoted political analyst Mostafa Khoshcheshm as saying:“It was expected from the Israelis and Americans to start using [hues and] cries about the current affairs in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and go for … false-flag hijacking and unreal stories in order to rally international support for their bid to win a UN Security Council resolution against Iran.” That is false. Although details about the incident remain murky, there is no evidence of Israeli or American involvement, and the available evidence points toward Iran, which has a history of seizing ships.The Associated Press, citing a maritime radio recording to the Emirati coast guard, said the Asphalt Princess’s crew reported that Iranian gunmen had boarded the vessel. Satellite tracking showed the ship briefly heading into Iranian waters before changing course “several hours later” back to the Gulf of Oman, the AP said.A similar incident two years ago involved another ship owned by the same Dubai company that owns the Asphalt Princess. During that incident, Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel riding in speedboats filmed the ship as commandos descended onto its deck from a helicopter on ropes. Video of that incident clearly showed one of the speedboats flying the Iranian flag.In January, Iranian forces hijacked a South Korean-flagged tanker that Iran claimed had been “polluting.” Iranian authorities returned the tanker after Seoul agreed to release $1 billion in Iranian funds that South Korean banks had frozen under U.S. sanctions.In July 2020, an oil tanker sought by the U.S. for allegedly violating anti-Iran sanctions was hijacked off the coast of the UAE. The ship was later spotted in Iranian waters.Like the Asphalt Princess, the Mercer Street was traveling from the port of Fujairah in UAE when it came under attack from three explosive drones, one of which struck the pilot house and killed two crew members.U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said that the drone’s remnants and explosive residue indicated that it was manufactured in Iran. Photographs of the drone in the CENTCOM report match a drone shown in an Iranian-produced military demonstration video posted on YouTube by the Russian state media outlet RT (Russia Today).;https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-business-persian-gulf-tensions-gulf-of-oman-08e86af0cd35761ef8c25686a7ac6282,https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Asphalt-Princess-7382988.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58078506,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41812/mysterious-potential-hijack-of-commercial-ship-ongoing-in-the-gulf-of-oman,https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/2722418/us-central-command-statement-on-the-investigation-into-the-attack-on-the-motor/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ronald_Reagan,https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-70fc4b24d0071820562033a07bb9060f,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58083671,https://youtu.be/Uks4DvpMhpA,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-tanker-int/south-korean-flagged-tanker-seized-by-iran-seoul-demands-release-idUSKBN299188,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/world/middleeast/iran-south-korea-ship-released.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/7/15/tanker-sought-by-us-over-iran-sanctions-was-hijacked,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58124489,https://www.centcom.mil/Portals/6/PressReleases/MERCERSTREETATTACK06AUG2%20final.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khev3f0BJ90;Iran’s Bogus ‘False Flag’ Claim on Ship Attack;;;;;;

Last week the militant Islamists​ captured Zaranj, the capital of Nimruz Province, Sheberghan, capital of Jowzjan province, and on Sunday, August 8, two more provincial capitals: Kunduz and Taleqan. The Taliban has also taken control over Afghanistan’s borders with Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, both of them former Soviet republics in Central Asia in which Russia maintains a military presence.Interactive Map: Taliban Control In Afghanistan Then And NowCommenting on Taliban advances, Kabulov claimed the group has no ties with any terrorist organizations, including Islamic State and al-Qaida. He said there was “not a single fact” in Taliban history showing the group posed a threat to Central Asia.Without evidence, he also claimed that the U.S. and the Afghan government invented a connection between the Taliban and al-Qaida to justify heavy combat losses.“Ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida are bogus,” Kabulov said. “The only ones talking about [such ties] are the government in Kabul and the Americans.”That is false.In fact, the Taliban has a longstanding relationship with al-Qaida. It has been noted not only by the United States and Afghan government, but by the United Nations, European Union and Russia itself, as expressed recently by the country’s top defense official.Osama bin Laden (left) sits with his adviser Ayman al-Zawahiri during an interview with Pakistani journalist on May 2, 2011, in Afghanistan.The U.N. Security Council has a special team that monitors terrorist threats and provides annual situation reports. Its latest publicly available report, from May 2020, confirmed the Taliban’s alliance with al-Qaida.“Relations between the Taliban and Al-Qaida remain close, based on friendship, a history of shared struggle, ideological sympathy and intermarriage,” the report stated.“The senior leadership of Al-Qaida remains present in Afghanistan, as well as hundreds of armed operatives, Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, and groups of foreign terrorist fighters aligned with the Taliban. A number of significant Al-Qaida figures were killed in Afghanistan during the reporting period.”“The Taliban regularly consulted with Al-Qaida during negotiations with the United States and offered guarantees that it would honor their historical ties,” the report said.The European Union’s security agency, Europol, stated in its most recent annual terrorism report that, three EU member states – Austria, France, and Germany – saw 10 jihadist attacks in 2020 that killed 12 people and injured more than 42.The majority of these attacks in the EU were incited by al-Qaida propaganda, the Europol report said, and the group has “continued to pursue its strategy to embed itself in local conflicts,” with most affiliates in its global network reiterating allegiance to the al-Qaida branch in Afghanistan.Policemen patrol in Vienna on November 3, 2020, one day after a shooting at multiple locations across central Vienna.“There is no daylight between al-Qaida and Taliban. They are completely attached. Remaining al-Qaida commanders do sit on the Taliban Shura (the Council meetings) and do have a say,” Brian Glyn Williams, professor of Islamic history at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, told Polygraph.info. Williams lived in Uzbekistan in the late 1990s and has written several books on terrorism, including in Afghanistan and Central Asia.Williams said U.S. intelligence on al-Qaida-Taliban interactions is based in part on thousands of hours of drone footage used to identify, track and kill “thousands” of al-Qaida operatives in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Al-Qaida has transformed the Taliban from a government into a deadly terrorist insurgency back in early 2000s,” Williams said. “The ties do exist, they are strong, they are formalized, they are about two decades old, and any attempt to artificially de-link al-Qaida from Taliban is pure Russian-style disinformation.”On July 28, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russian troops would conduct joint “tactical military drills” with Uzbek troops in Tajikistan. The drills, which began this week, were in response “to many security threats” to Central Asia posed by the Taliban’s advancement in Afghanistan, Shoigu said.Shoigu commented on the security risks from the Taliban again on August 6. He said that although Russia hopes that existing agreements with the Taliban will be implemented, it is hard to believe, given past experience.Russian and Uzbek soldiers carry out military exercises on the military training ground near Termez, Surkhandarya region of Uzbekistan, on August 6, 2021.In recent weeks, Russia has deployed more than 2,000 troops to Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan, in addition to units already at the 201st Military Base. President Vladimir Putin offered to help Tajikistan defend itself from a potential war with the Taliban, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on July 22.The ministry said that Russia and Tajikistan are working on an agreement for the Russian military to build an outpost on the Afghan-Tajik border. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko said that terrorists from war zones in the Middle East and North Africa are gathering in Central Asia, while the Taliban has gained total control over the border with Tajikistan.The leaders of the five Central Asian nations met in Turkmenistan on August 6 to discuss a joint response to the potential security threats posed by the instability in Afghanistan, The Associated Press reported.Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rakhmon said that more than 2,000 Afghan army soldiers have crossed into Tajikistan fleeing the Taliban’s offensive. More than 3,000 terrorist groups gathered in Afghanistan along the border with Tajikistan. “These are extremists who are well-trained in sabotage, terrorism and propaganda activities and have far-reaching plans concerning our region,” Rakhmon said.Williams said the Taliban’s behavior in the late 1990s bears consideration.“The first thing the Taliban did when they captured northern Afghanistan back in 1998 was allow the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an extremist jihadi group, to establish their headquarters in the town of Kunduz, and they used these headquarters as a springboard for launching cross-border raids in 1998-2001 into Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan,” Williams said.“Under Taliban from 1998 to 2001, Afghanistan has become the world’s greatest safe haven for terrorists, and these terrorists launch raids deep into Central Asia, causing deep concern to Moscow. So, the fact that they are now trying to promote this revisionist history that erases these waves of terrorist attacks from Taliban territory is an attempt to whitewash history.”Twenty years later that pattern remains steady. ""[I]n some of the areas along Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan that were recently captured by the Taliban, a militant group from Tajikistan, Jamaat Ansarullo, is now in charge,"" Radio Free Europe reported on August 8. Turkmenistan citizens are among the ranks of militant groups operating in northern Afghanistan, ""some who are allied with the Taliban, some who are not,"" the RFE/RL said.The Russian Supreme Court declared Taliban a terrorist organization and banned it in 2003. “The Taliban Movement” is number eleven on the Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) list of 34 terrorist organizations.";https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/taliban-afghanistan,https://news.yahoo.com/afghanistan-street-fighting-rages-taliban-183030982.html,https://www.ft.com/content/bc79c30f-e99e-4266-aac6-51498fc62423,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/08/06/afghanistan-taliban-nimruz/,https://www.npr.org/2021/08/08/1025909600/taliban-seizes-2-more-provincial-capitals-in-afghanistan,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kunduz-province-afghanistan-taliban/,https://www.longwarjournal.org/mapping-taliban-control-in-afghanistan,https://www.sentiman.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/e47a18ee08bf405694136d4d4a78a3a0_6.jpg,/a/fact-check-taliban-al-qaida-russia/6723773.html?layout=1,https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N20/110/60/PDF/N2011060.pdf?OpenElement,https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-2021-tesat,https://brianglynwilliams.com/,https://www.amazon.com/Predators-CIAs-Drone-War-Qaeda/dp/1612346170,https://tvzvezda.ru/news/20217281222-oF9lf.html,https://ria.ru/20210805/agressiya-1744531440.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://tj.sputniknews.ru/20210805/russia-voennye-bazy-tajikistan-kyrgyzstan-ugroza-afganistan-1041430069.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://ura.news/news/1052495593,https://ura.news/news/1052495593,https://www.vb.kg/doc/403833_mid_rf:_na_sever_afganistana_stiagivautsia_terroristy_iz_zon_boevyh_deystviy.html?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Ftext%3D,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/central-asian-leaders-worried-turmoil-afghanistan-79313125,http://www.thelastwarlord.com/,https://www.rferl.org/a/31399458.html,http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/npd/terror.htm;Top Russian Officials Confused About al-Qaida, Taliban Ties;;;;;;
170;;;;False;Morgan Artyukhina;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/lloyd-austin-south-china-sea/6743075.html;Russian State Media Buoy Beijing’s False Claims in South China Sea;2021-07-29;polygraph;;On July 27, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited Singapore as part of a Southeast Asian tour “to deepen America’s bonds” with its allies and partners on a host of security concerns.Austin, who is also visiting Vietnam and the Philippines, spoke on a range of issues, from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and global vaccination supply to conflict prevention and deterrence.In asserting a “dedication to freedom of the seas,” “the rule of law,” “core international commitments,” and “an insistence that disputes will be solved peacefully,” Austin said: “This region has witnessed actions that just don’t line up with those shared principles.”“Beijing’s claim to the vast majority of the South China Sea has no basis in international law. That assertion treads on the sovereignty of states in the region. We continue to support the region’s coastal states in upholding their rights under international law. And we remain committed to the treaty obligations that we have to Japan in the Senkaku Islands and to the Philippines in the South China Sea,” he said.In a piece for Russian state broadcaster Sputnik, news editor Morgan Artyukhina wrote that Austin’s statements reflected “the typical pattern of American diplomatic statements on the issue of US-China relations.”U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaks at the IISS Fullerton Lecture in Singapore on July 27, 2021. Caroline Chia/Reuters“[W]hile saying he wanted peace and stability, he also levied a slew of unsubstantiated claims at China that placed sole blame for any rifts in that relationship on Beijing’s lap,” Artyukhina wrote.Regarding the South China Sea, she wrote: “Washington has inserted itself into a regional dispute over maritime claims in the waterway.” She added: “The nations have recently redoubled their efforts to arrive at a Code of Conduct governing interactions in the South China Sea, but the US has erroneously claimed that China is imposing its will on the other countries.”That is false. And it’s not just the United States that has called out China’s illegal territorial machinations and intimidation of its seafaring neighbors.China has disregarded international law, rejected court rulings at The Hague in Geneva and used naval power to assert dominance in the South China Sea.As Polygraph.info and others previously reported, in 2009 China claimed it had “indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof.”The Philippines disputed that claim with the Arbitral Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, alleging that China was denying the Philippines’ rights to its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and territorial waters.The Hague rebuked China’s sweeping claims to the sea. The ruling made clear that states are entitled to operate within their EEZs, which are recognized under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the 200-nautical mile stretch of water from the coast of a state.Earlier this month, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared The Hague’s ruling “illegal, null and void.”Moscow in years past concurred. In 2016, President Vladimir Putin said Russia agreed with and supported “China’s position to not recognize the court’s ruling.”He said China’s decision not to participate in The Hague tribunal invalidated its ruling. Like Artyukhina, Putin added that “the involvement of any third-party powers from outside the region is detrimental and counterproductive.”Crew members of China's South Sea Fleet take part in a drill in the Xisha Islands, or the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea, on May 5, 2016.Since The Hague’s ruling, China has only beefed up militarization of the region.In January, China’s top legislative body gave its Coast Guard a green light to fire on ships in disputed waters, inspect ships in Chinese-claimed waters and destroy structures on Chinese-claimed reefs, Reuters reported.In February, the Voice of America reported that China will use the law granting its Coast Guard the power to fire on foreign ships to target states like Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, all of which have competing claims in the South China Sea.Hostile actions were taken prior to the passage of that law.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, China has repeatedly sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the disputed Paracel Islands and reportedly used the threat of force to halt Vietnamese drilling projects that fall within the so-called “nine-dash line,” an arbitrarily imposed boundary that China claims gives it control over most of the South China Sea.The JDC Hakuryu-5 deep water drilling platform in the South China Sea off the coast of Vung Tau, Vietnam on April 29, 2018.An April 2020 attack on a Vietnamese fishing boat drew a protest from Hanoi, to no effect. Two months later, the Chinese Coast Guard attacked another Vietnamese vessel.Chinese vessels have also reportedly engaged in standoffs with Malaysian ships carrying out oil exploration activities within Malaysia’s economic zone.China has established dozens of military outposts in the disputed Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands, and it seized the Scarborough Shoal, some 137 miles east of the Philippines’ island of Luzon. China’s military blockade of the shoal is illegal under The Hague’s 2016 ruling.In March, the Philippines ramped up demands that China withdraw dozens of so-called “Maritime Militia” ships “moored, anchored and stationary at Julian Felipe Reef,” in the Spratly Islands and the Philippines’ economic zone, according to Radio Free Asia (a U.S.-funded sister news organization to VOA).Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has lamented that asserting the country’s rights under the 2016 ruling might lead to war.China has built fortified artificial islands, replete with runways, hangers, anti-ship cruise missiles, anti-aircraft batteries and missile defenses, Defense News reported.Writing for War on the Rocks, Gregory Poling, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, noted that these fortified islands fit with Beijing’s strategy of using “civilian and paramilitary pressure to coerce its Southeast Asian neighbors into abandoning their rights.”Satellite imagery shows what the CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative calls the deployment of several new weapons systems, including a J-11 combat aircraft, at China’s base on Woody Island in the Paracels, South China Sea on May 12, 2018.China’s sweeping maritime claims are null under international law. Polygraph.info, citing multiple experts, detailed how China's attempts to redraw the maritime boundaries of the South China Sea have no legal justification under the UNCLOS.Although China ratified the UNCLOS and has no right to claim its decisions are not binding, experts note that the UNCLOS has no enforcement mechanism.;https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Speeches/Speech/Article/2708192/secretary-of-defense-remarks-at-the-40th-international-institute-for-strategic/,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2009re_mys_vnm_e.pdf,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1891450.shtml,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/52834,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coastguard-law/china-authorises-coast-guard-to-fire-on-foreign-vessels-if-needed-idUSKBN29R1ER,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/chinas-coast-guard-can-fire-foreign-vessels-complicating-security-south-sea,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1526701/vietnam-airs-video-chinese-ship-sinking-fishing-boat-south-china-sea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea/vietnam-protests-beijings-sinking-of-south-china-sea-boat-idUSKBN21M072,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/vietnam-halts-south-china-sea-oil-drilling-project-under-pressure-from-beijing-idUSKBN1GZ0JN,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN21M072,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-fisheries-society-condemns-china-attack-on-boat-demands-compensation-4115245.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/malaysian-oil-exploration-vessel-leaves-south-china-sea-waters-after-standoff-idUSKBN22O1M9,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/demand-03312021154924.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-expansionism-south-china-sea/31217558.html,https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/17/chinas-island-fortifications-are-a-challenge-to-international-norms/,https://warontherocks.com/2020/01/the-conventional-wisdom-on-chinas-island-bases-is-dangerously-wrong/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-expansionism-south-china-sea/31217558.html,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/why-a-ruling-that-cannot-be-enforced-still-matters;Russian State Media Buoy Beijing’s False Claims in South China Sea;;;;;;
171;;;;False;Ikenna Emewu;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/tibet-xi-jiping-visit-religious-freedom/6743070.html;Unholy Spin: Xi Endorses ‘Religious Rights’ In Tibet;2021-07-27;polygraph;;On July 21, Chinese president and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping made the first official presidential visit to Tibet in decades.Chinese state media extensively covered the unannounced visit, repeatedly referring to the trip as an “inspection.”Chinese state media noted the visit corresponded with what it called “the 70th anniversary of Tibet's peaceful liberation,” repeatedly asserting that the region has since seen social and economic improvements.Ikenna Emewu, editor-in-chief of Africa China Economy Magazine in Nigeria, repeated many of those talking points in an opinion piece for the Chinese state outlet CGTN.The op-ed, headlined “Xi's Tibet visit endorses Chinese pluralism, religious rights,” was meant to counter what it called “the overtly contorted tales about China's blanket aversion for religion.”Emewu cited Xi’s visits to Tibetan Buddhist holy sites and interactions with Buddhist monks as “direct evidence to counter the claims that China's government opposes religion in all its dimensions.”“This outing [of Xi] has become a major turnaround, signaling a truer picture of the leadership of China for a liberal stance in a plural society of multi-culture, religion and languages,” he wrote.But characterizing Xi’s visit to Tibet and religious sites as a Communist Party endorsement of religious rights in the region presents a misleading and false impression.Xi has intensified a decades-long crackdown on Tibetans’ religious freedoms.The London-based rights group Amnesty International noted in its 2020 report on China that state repression in Tibet “remained severe.” People in Tibet, it reported, were “arbitrarily detained for ordinary religious practices that authorities deemed ‘signs of extremism’ under cover of so-called ‘De-extremification Regulations’.”The New York-based group Human Rights Watch recently reported that 20 Tibetan monks from Tengdro monastery in Tingri county were detained. Some of them were beaten severely after members of their order were discovered to have communicated with and donated money to Tibetans in exile who’d been affected by the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal.Four of the monks were sentenced to harsh jail sentences.A 19-year-old Tibetan monk who was arrested in 2019 and rearrested the following year reportedly died in January from beatings and mistreatment in custody.He had been detained along with six other monks, one as young as 16, for peacefully handing out leaflets and shouting slogans calling for Tibet’s independence. The monks were sentenced to up to five years in prison.Earlier this month, as many as 30 Tibetans were reportedly arrested for celebrating the July 6 birthday of Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.The Dalai Lama, 86, left Tibet during the 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. China has insisted it will choose the Dalai Lama’s successor and has cracked down on those who possess photos of or post online about the spiritual leader.Tibetans in Taiwan attend a gathering to mark the 62nd anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in Taipei on March 10, 2021. Ann Wang/ReutersA Tibetan shopkeeper received a five-year prison sentence for carrying a flag with a picture of the Dalai Lama on it.Tibetan monasteries have been closed to outside visitors on the Dalai Lama’s birthday.China has sought to control or appoint other Tibetan religious authorities, including the Panchen Lama, the second-highest religious authority in Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama selected Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen in 1995. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, then just six years old, was taken away by Chinese authorities, never to resurface.Gedhun Choekyi Nyima has been referred to as the world’s youngest political prisoner.According to Radio Free Asia (a sister news agency to the Voice of America, which publishes Polygraph.info), Chinese authorities “have had difficulty persuading Tibetans to accept their Panchen Lama as the official face of Tibetan Buddhism in China.”Many of the restrictions faced by Tibetans mirror those confronting Muslim minorities in China’s northwestern Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.A month before Xi became president in March 2013, authorities in Tibet announced they would expand the region's surveillance and monitoring system, focusing on “special groups,” including ex-prisoners and former exiles.Paramilitary police officers swap positions during a change of guard in front of Potala Palace in Lhasa, during a government-organized tour of the Tibet Autonomous Region on October 15, 2020. Thomas Peter/ReutersIn 2011, Chen Quanguo, then Tibet's CCP party secretary, instituted a “grid-style social management” system that saw a massive ramp-up of policing and surveillance, including within monasteries.In its International Religious Freedom report for 2015, the U.S. State Department, citing Chinese government figures, reported 7,000 government cadres had been dispatched to work at 1,787 monasteries during Chen’s tenure.Access to and from religious sites was blocked and/or restricted, especially on sensitive dates like the anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising and the Dalai Lama’s birthday.Life, religious and otherwise, remains highly curtailed for Tibetans, with travel restrictions enforced both inside China and internationally, particularly on those seeking to go on religious pilgrimages to India, where the Dalai Lama and other prominent religious leaders live in exile.Monks and nuns have also been subjected to “patriotic education” campaigns, in which they were forced to denounce the Dalai Lama and to study “materials praising the leadership of the CCP and the socialist system.”The State Department report noted that these heightened restrictions served as the “impetus behind some of the self-immolations and protests.”Radio Free Asia reported that from 2009 to January 2021, 157 Tibetans set themselves ablaze to protest Chinese rule.In 2016, Chen was dispatched to Xinjiang, where he replicated his comprehensive system of social control.In September 2020, Reuters reported that Tibetans were increasingly being pushed into military style training centers, mirroring allegations of ideological reeducation and forced labor in Xinjiang.Polygraph.info and others have reported that religious persecution in China extends to many faith groups, with harassment, arrest, detention, torture, imprisonment and forced indoctrination employed against those who practice their faiths in defiance of myriad state restrictions.;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-07/26/c_1310085177.htm,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1229449.shtml,https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/,https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/07/06/prosecute-them-awesome-power/chinas-crackdown-tengdro-monastery-and-restrictions,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/21/china-tibetan-monk-dies-beating-custody,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/birthday-07132021190008.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/photos-04092021131635.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/nomad-12292020105954.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/prisoner-release-04062020211513.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/closed-07102020171803.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48071043,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/panchen-07262021161225.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/20/china-alarming-new-surveillance-security-tibet#,https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?dynamic_load_id=256099&year=2015#wrapper,https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/tibetan-man-dies-after-self-immolation-protest-against-china,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/news-01142021150839.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-tibet-exclusive/exclusive-china-sharply-expands-mass-labor-program-in-tibet-idUSKCN26D0GT,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-xinjiang-religious-freedom/31004192.html;Unholy Spin: Xi Endorses ‘Religious Rights’ In Tibet;;;;;;

Russia Inflates a Minor Mistake Into a Bogus Navalny Conspiracy;2021-07-27;polygraph;;"On July 22, Russia’s state-owned RIA Novosti news agency published an article quoting Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova’s comments on a report released by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Zakharova cited a new ""fact” in the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny found in the draft version of the OPCW report, which, she said, demanded a full-blown investigation. Forget that the OCPW report really wasn’t about Navalny and didn’t even name him. Or that the fact was a minor mistake that was corrected in the final OCPW report.“This newly revealed fact in the case of the so-called ‘Navalny poisoning’ should be the subject of the most thorough study,” she said of the draft version of the OPCW report.“It is necessary, finally, to shed light on the origins of this clearly orchestrated provocation, which in essence is intended to cast a shadow on the good name of our country and once and for all undermine the OPCW.""That a minor corrected error suggests an choreographed conspiracy is false, although “ridiculous” may be a more apt description.As RIA Novosti itself reported, the glitch was simply a mistaken date in the draft version of the report, which merely summarizes recent activities of the chemical weapons watchdog.Without naming Navalny, the draft stated that on August 20, 2020, the OPCW received a request from German authorities for a specialist team to aid in the investigation of the poisoning of a Russian citizen. That was obviously wrong given that August 20, 2020, was the day Navalny fell violently and suspiciously ill on a flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. After collapsing in pain in the airplane’s lavatory, the pilot made an emergency landing in Omsk, where Navalny was taken to the hospital and initially treated for ingestion of a toxic substance. Two days later, Russian authorities allowed Navalny, now in a coma, to be flown to Germany for further treatment.The final version of the OPCW report cited the correct date for Germany’s request for help in its investigation: September 4, 2020. By then, Navalny had already been in Berlin’s Charite Hospital in Berlin for nearly two weeks.The RIA Novosti article reported that Rainer Breul, a German Foreign Ministry official, refuted speculative claims about the date, saying it was printed in error and corrected. The state-owned TASS news agency also reported this. Russian authorities’ explanation for Navalny’s sickness, repeated in the RIA Novosti article, is that he fell ill due to an unnamed metabolic disorder that caused his blood sugar to rapidly drop.Navalny has no history of such a disorder.Doctors in Omsk, where Navalny was initially hospitalized, claimed they found no traces of toxic substances in his body.However, one of the doctors who treated Navalny in Omsk told Reuters he initially suspected the opposition leader had been poisoned and gave Navalny atropine, a drug to treat victims of nerve agents.This is likely what saved Navalny’s life. We say that because in December 2020, with the help of the open-source intelligence organization Bellingcat, Navalny managed to contact one of the men who had helped poison him, FSB operative Konstantin Kudryavtsev.Posing as an official working on a report for the Kremlin’s Security Council, Navalny elicited a wealth of information from Kudryavtsev, who divulged that Navalny survived because the pilot of the airliner he was on promptly made an emergency landing and medical workers immediately treated him for poisoning.In June, members of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation reported they obtained Navalny’s unredacted medical records from the hospital in Omsk. They said the original records reported traces of a cholinesterase inhibitor in Navalny’s blood. Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent, is such a substance.The OPCW and three European laboratories ran tests after Navalny was transferred to Berlin. All confirmed he had been poisoned with a Novichok agent.";https://www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2021/07/ec9702%20c26crp01%28e%29.pdf,https://www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2021/07/ec9702%20c26crp01%28e%29.pdf,https://tass.com/world/1313953,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-health/russia-first-treated-navalny-for-suspected-poisoning-then-u-turned-doctor-idUSKBN25X0MA,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fsb-fails-damage-control-of-navalny-s-phone-call-/31025420.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/06/10/siberian-doctors-falsified-navalnys-poisoning-report-investigation-a74184;Really?

173;;;;Misleading;Zeng Yixin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/gain-of-function-coronavirus-wuhan-china/6743065.html;Update: China Misleads on Nature of Wuhan Coronavirus Research;2021-07-23;polygraph;;"Update: After publication of this fact check, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases responded to Polygraph.info's questions about gain-of-function research. The statement said that while the institute indirectly funded virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, none of that research involved making viruses more dangerous, and multiple expert reviews determined it did not meet the definition of gain-of-function research. See the full statement below.---On July 22, a senior Chinese health official said he was “shocked"" by a recent World Health Organization suggestion that another round of investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic was needed in China.Beijing both rejected the suggestion that another probe be conducted in Wuhan, where the pandemic erupted in December 2019, and the suggestion the virus might have escaped from a laboratory at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).That reaction was promoted by WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus' call the previous week for an audit of the institute and other research organizations and relevant sites in Wuhan.Tedros, who said earlier investigative efforts had been hampered by a lack of information from China, called on China to help get to the bottom of the origins quest “by sharing all relevant data in a spirit of transparency.”Tedros said there had been a “premature push” to dismiss the theory that a lab leak could have seeded the pandemic.A 14-member WHO team visited China for 27 days in January and February. Their report initially concluded it was “extremely unlikely” the pandemic originated in a laboratory but added that “laboratory accidents do happen.” That report concluded it was far more likely the virus emerged naturally.Members of the WHO team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 arrive at the Wuhan Institute of Virology on February 3, 2021.Zeng Yixin, deputy director of China’s National Health Commission, said the calls for an additional investigation in China showed a “lack of respect for common sense and the arrogance to science in the proposal,” according to China’s state-run Global Times.The Times reported that Zeng told journalists on July 22 “the WIV has no man-made viruses and has never conducted gain-of-function researches.”The Global Times quoted Zeng as saying the WHO should “promote the origins study in more countries and places around the world.”At the same time, The Global Times posted a letter, on Chinese social media apps WeChat and Weibo, “entrusted” to them by “a group of Chinese netizens … urging the WHO to investigate Fort Detrick,” a U.S. Army lab in Maryland.Zeng Yixin, Vice Minister of the Chinese National Health Commission, speaks at a press conference at the Information Office of the State Council in Beijing on Thursday, July 22, 2021. Mark Schiefelbein/APZeng’s statement about so-called gain-of-function research is misleading, and China’s attempts to show that Fort Detrick could be behind the virus are unsubstantiated and have been widely reported as a ploy to divert scrutiny.A debate is ongoing over gain-of-function research, which involves tinkering with viruses to alter qualities to predict their potential for causing widespread disease. In theory, gain-of-function studies can stop deadly viruses before they propagate.There is no debate about whether viruses were manipulated at the Wuhan lab. Rather, the issue is what type of manipulation is considered gain of function, based on differing bureaucratic and scientific guidelines.Shi Zhengli, an expert on bat coronaviruses and director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the WIV, denied ever conducting research on gain for function when interviewed by The New York Times in June, and by China Science News (CSN) almost a year ago.But a 2015 paper, titled “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence,” reported on a human-made virus that may infect people. The paper cited Shi's contribution to its preparation, and the WIV served as the key lab.The paper described how genetics were employed in the process:""Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric [human-made] virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.”In June 2016, Shi and Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO fact-finding mission to Wuhan, and others released a study on how they had performed research on different types of “WIV1”—a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-like coronavirus “with high genomic similarity to human SARS-CoV.”SARS-CoV is similar to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.As Polygraph.info previously noted, Daszak has been instrumental in arguing against the lab-leak theory. He is president of the EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based organization “that conducts research and outreach programs on global health, conservation and international development.”The alliance gave $600,000 in U.S. government funding to the WIV to study coronaviruses in bats.In February 2016, several months before Shi and Daszak released their study, Daszak discussed how his colleagues in China had arguably carried out gain-of-function research involving bat viruses.“We found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein: the protein that attaches to cells. Then we … Well I didn’t do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work. You create pseudo particles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses, see if they bind to human cells. At each step of this you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people,” Daszak said.A “spike protein” is a specific feature of a coronavirus, through which the virus penetrates host cells and causes disease.A 2017 study by WIV scientists, including Shi, titled “Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus,” noted the use of “chimeric"" viruses in studying how two SARS-CoV viruses (WIV1 and WIV16) were able to infect and replicate in human cells.That and other research conducted by the WIV was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The work was encouraged by EcoHealth Alliance.Rowan Jacobsen wrote in the MIT Technology Review last month that the EcoHealth Alliance received a five-year, $3.75 million grant in 2014 “to study the risk that more bat-borne coronaviruses would emerge in China,” with some of that work “subcontracted to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”Later in 2014, the U.S. government placed a moratorium on gain-of-function research due to safety concerns, including fears the research itself could result in an “accidental pandemic” through a lab leak.In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing sent diplomats to the WIV. What they learned about the lab’s operations prompted them to cable Washington, D.C., expressing alarm.U.S. embassy officials had become aware in late 2017 that WIV researchers had discovered three new viruses with spike proteins that posed a public health risk. Their discovery, combined with the fact that the WIV's National Bio-safety Laboratory was the first such facility in China and was only completed in 2014, prompted their visit to the lab.One cable, dated January 19, 2018, warned that the WIV “has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians, and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” The Washington Post reported.Politics now surrounds the debate over whether U.S.-funded studies at WIV constitute gain-of-function research and whether a dangerous experiment could have leaked.NIAID Director Anthony Fauci has on multiple occasions denied that the NIH directly funded gain-of-function research at the WIV.In a contentious exchange between Fauci and Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul during a July 20 hearing, Paul brought up the 2017 WIV study.Paul, who is a physician, noted that Shi, who acknowledged the NIH funding for that study, “took two bat coronavirus (spike) genes and combined them with a SARS-related backbone to create new viruses that are not found in nature.” He added that the “lab-created viruses were then shown to replicate in humans.”Paul further said that “viruses that only infect animals in nature were manipulated in the Wuhan lab to gain the function of infecting humans.”Fauci replied that “qualified staff up and down the chain” did not consider that research to be gain of function, telling Paul: “You do not know what you’re talking about.”But Fauci has been criticized for splitting hairs. Writing in The Washington Post, columnist Josh Rogin noted that Fauci’s definition of gain of function likely hews to federal guidelines from 2017 and not the broad scientific understanding of the term.Rogin cited Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University, who said the Shi study in question “matches, indeed epitomizes the definition of gain of function research.”Polygraph.info reached out to the NIH for clarification on what constitutes gain of function research. The NIH said in a statement that none of the studies at the WIV were designed to manipulate viruses to increase their transmissibility or ability to cause disease (complete statement below).Polygraph.info and other fact-checkers have debunked Chinese claims about the U.S. Army biodefense research center at Fort Detrick as unsubstantiated. But the Chinese haven’t given up.The Global Times claims that, as of July 22, five million Chinese citizens had signed a petition calling for an investigation into whether Fort Detrick was the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.------Statement received on July 27, 2021, from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases:""The experiments conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as described in the 2017 Plos Pathogens paper were supported indirectly by NIAID under a sub-award from EcoHealth Alliance.""NIAID reviewed the grant under the U.S. Government Gain-of-Function Deliberative Process and Research Funding Pause of Selected Gain-of-Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS and SARS Viruses. A detailed staff review determined the research proposed under the grant did not meet the criteria for gain-of-function research described in this policy.""Under the grant, EcoHealth Alliance proposed research to create chimeric viruses by placing a small portion of newly identified, evolutionarily distant, bat coronaviruses into another well characterized bat coronavirus that has never been demonstrated to infect humans called WIV1. The purpose of this work was to examine whether the newly discovered viruses were able to use the human ACE2 receptor like WIV1 and other SARS-related coronaviruses already do. In the context of these experiments, this well-characterized bat coronavirus would be considered the parental strain against which the function of the new chimeric viruses would be assessed. With this comparison, the newly created chimeric viruses did not gain any function relative to the parental strain; the chimeric viruses did not replicate in cell culture any better than the parental WIV1. In addition, research that had been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals demonstrated that viruses similar to those proposed under the grant had reduced pathogenicity as compared to the parental viruses. For these reasons, it was not reasonably anticipated that the viruses involved in research under the grant would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route, and therefore did not meet the criteria for gain-of-function research described in the research funding pause.""NIAID subsequently reviewed this grant under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO Framework). Again, a detailed staff review determined that the experiments described in the grant were not subject to the HHS P3CO Framework, because they were not reasonably expected to increase transmissibility or virulence of these viruses in humans.""None of the studies proposed under this grant were designed to manipulate the viruses in a way that would increase their transmissibility or pathogenicity, and no NIAID funding was approved to support gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, as defined by United States Government criteria.

174;;;;False;Bharati Pravin Pawar;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-india-coronavirus/6743063.html;India’s Puzzling Denial About Oxygen and COVID-19 Deaths;2021-07-22;polygraph;;India was slammed by a second wave of COVID-19 in mid-March. India officially says some 418,000 people have died from the pandemic, but according to new research, the real figure could be an astonishing 3 million to 4 million deaths.The BJP government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been under close global scrutiny for its delayed pandemic response. Part of the criticism originated from Indian states that complained of acute oxygen shortages in hospitals. At the same time, oxygen exports from India have doubled during the pandemic.On July 19, an opposition member of India’s parliament, K.C. Venugopal, demanded an investigation into unnecessary deaths from oxygen deprivation. Television news reports showed Indian citizens in desperate conditions outside hospitals after being turned away for lack of beds and oxygen. Relatives of victims were shown pleading with doctors, who were unable to help. Indian Minister of State for Health, Bharti Pravin Pawar, claimed in a written statement: “No deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by the states/Uts [union territories].” Numerous reports show that this claim is false. Pawar’s brazen denial shocked many, including the BBC’s India correspondent, Vikas Pandey, who tweeted: “My cousin was among those who died because the hospital ran out of oxygen. There are countless stories like mine. My phone still has helpless texts asking for oxygen cylinders and beds.”BBC news had reported back on April 23 that states such as “Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India were all facing an oxygen shortage. Some hospitals in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh have put signs reading 'oxygen out of stock' outside their entrances, while hospitals in the state capital Lucknow have asked patients to move elsewhere.” On July 21, The Times of India, citing hospitals and other local sources, reported the following death tolls from lack of oxygen: Delhi: 12 people on May 1 as reported by Batra Hospital.  Goa: 83 people between May 11 and May 15.  Karnataka: 36 people died between May 2 and May 3. Andhra Pradesh: 23 deaths in May.  Haryana: 19 deaths between April 5 and May 1.  Deputy Chief Minister of New Delhi, Manish Sisodia told Asia News International this week that the government’s lack of responsibility and the fact that it had initiated a change in oxygen redistribution policy on April 13 were to blame for a “massive crisis in India.”  The New Delhi government aimed to set up a committee to account for the deaths caused by shortage of oxygen so families could receive compensation. But Sisodia said the proposal was dismissed by the lieutenant governor of the capital, on orders from the central government. Modi’s government claimed that political opponents in Delhi were “over exaggerating” the oxygen needs by a factor of four. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences disputed that claim. In May, the situation in Delhi led to the Supreme Court to order the central government to make “a comprehensive plan” to meet the oxygen requirements.A report by Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser for the Indian government, and researchers at the Center for Global Development and Harvard University, released on July 20, estimated that the true death toll from COVID-19 in India could be between 3.4 million and 4.7 million people from January 2020 to June 2021 – a figure roughly 10 times the official number. India’s Government this week dismissed estimates of COVID-19 deaths in the millions as “fallacious” and mere speculation.

Benfold was exercising its right of innocent passage guaranteed under international law.The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the South China Sea on July 7, 2020.The U.S. naval vessel was conducting a regular freedom of navigation operation intended to uphold “the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law,” the U.S. Navy said in a statement on July 12 .It added that such operations are intended to challenge “the unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam,” as well as Beijing’s “claim to strait baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands.”Independent experts supported that argument.“There’s absolutely no question that what the U.S. was doing is consistent with international law and the law of the sea convention,” Gunther Handl, a professor of international law at Tulane University, told Polygraph.info. “China as a continental state cannot claim archipelagic status, which deprives it of its argument.”William Lay, a professor at the University of Bridgeport with expertise in international law and South China Sea conflict, agreed that “the U.S. position is legally far stronger.”“[The Chinese position] does not refer to specific provisions of international law, but only states vaguely that the US passage ‘violated the international law and basic norms’,” Lay told Polygraph.info.Armand de Mestral, a law professor and expert in international law at McGill University in Montreal, told Polygraph.info “the United States is on better ground” in asserting its rights to innocent passage.Handl noted that such operations to ensure freedom of navigation are “entirely consistent with the Law of the Sea.”The U.S. Navy cites the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which “lays down a comprehensive regime of law and order in the world's oceans and seas establishing rules governing all uses of the oceans and their resources.”Article 19 of UNCLOS allows foreign ships, including military vessels, to pass through the territorial waters of another state so long as that passage is “not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.”De Mestral said the status of the Paracel Islands has no bearing on that right.“Provided no threat to the coastline is offered, and the weapons are closed down, in other words they don’t have guns trained on the shore, there is a right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, although there are countries that would like to deny that. But I believe the law of the sea convention makes that plain,” De Mestral said.Handl concurred.“Even if we were to assume that the incident occurred within the territorial sea of one of these individual islands … the United States has a right to innocent passage. A right of innocent passage applies to warships. The United States is not subject to a prior notification requirement,” Handl said.In claiming ownership of the Paracel Islands, China has also attempted to draw baselines around them and other island groupings in the South China Sea.Baselines generally refer to the low water mark along a coast from which a territorial sea is measured. The territorial sea stretches 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a costal state.However, so-called archipelagic baselines are a form of straight baseline which, according to the United Nations, “[join] the outermost points of the outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago.”Those baselines are used to determine territorial waters of archipelagic states.“If you’re entitled to claim islands as an archipelago, then you can draw straight baselines from different points — shoals, islands, any formations in the sea that are above water at high tide up to a maximum length of 100 miles. And three percent of those baselines can actually run up to 125 miles,” Handl said.The U.S. does not recognize China’s 1996 declaration of straight baselines surrounding the Paracel Islands, regardless of who ultimately has sovereignty over them.“Straight baselines cannot be lawfully drawn in the Paracels under the international law of the sea as reflected in Article 7 of the Law of Sea Convention. Furthermore, international law does not permit continental States, like China, to establish baselines around entire dispersed island groups. With these baselines, China has attempted to claim more internal waters, territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, and continental shelf than it is entitled to under international law,” the U.S. Navy said. Handl says the U.S. Navy’s argument is correct.“China is a continental state, and it cannot claim offshore islands as an archipelago. All boundary lines must follow very closely the outlines of the islands. You cannot draw straight baselines across the sea as the Chinese do,” Handl said.Apart from the contested nature of the islands and China’s status as a continental state, the nature of the Paracel Islands precludes baselines from being drawn around them.“There’s a big proviso [in drawing archipelagic baselines.] And that is the maximum ratio of water to land that’s included must not exceed a ratio of nine to one. In the case of the Xisha Islands (Paracel Islands), the water to land ratio is 1,898 to 1. It just shows how irrational this claim is. It’s completely unfounded in international law, completely at variance with the law of the sea agreement, to which China is a party,” Handl said.“If China says we expelled the destroyer from waters within those islands, in reality those waters might have been high seas for purposes of construing rights and obligations.”De Mestral agreed.“The Paracel Islands are not a recognized archipelago and baselines of that sort can only be drawn around an archipelago,” he said.The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey prepares for a replenishment-at-sea in the South China Sea on May 19, 2017.Further undermining China’s claim, territorial waters extending from archipelagic baselines do not exclude the right to innocent passage, unlike the internal waters of coastal states.“We have so-called archipelagic waters, a special status which is different from the internal waters of a normal coastal state. If they were internal waters, then yes, you cannot enter internal waters without the coastal state’s permission. When it comes to archipelagic state waters, innocent passage regime applies throughout the archipelago,” Handl said.De Mestral says China has yet to make an “irrefutable claim” regarding sovereignty over the islands themselves.“That brings into question China’s whole claim to all of the South China Sea within the nine-dash line, which again, has not been recognized by the rest of the world, and was rejected by [The Hague] several years ago,” he said.In response to the PLA’s false claim, Collin Koh, a Research Fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, noted that the U.S. Navy freedom of navigation operation coincides with the fifth anniversary of The Hague ruling regarding maritime rights in the South China Sea.In January 2013, the Philippines initiated a legal claim against the People’s Republic of China under Annex VII to UNCLOS, which covers “the role of historic rights and the source of maritime entitlements in the South China Sea.”The petition, filed with the Arbitral Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, contended that China’s claims to the bulk of the South China Sea, demarcated by the so-called nine-dash line, violated the Philippines' rights to its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and territorial waters.The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea recognizes the 200-nautical mile stretch of sea from the coast of a state as its EEZ.In its July 2016 ruling, The Hague rebuked China’s sweeping claims to the sea.On July 12, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the result of that arbitration “illegal, null and void.”Scholars say it is China that is acting unlawfully.“I agree with the July 12, 2016, decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration that a great deal of China's activities in the region are contrary to international law,” Lay said.Handl said the arbitrators “bent over backwards to try to accommodate the Chinese viewpoint” and sought to interpret all of the materials and arguments put forward by Beijing “in the best possible light for China.”Ultimately, The Hague “concluded that what China is doing is void in terms of any claims to the South China Sea based on the nine-dash line,” he said.Moreover, Handl says the U.S. freedom of navigation operations have become necessary “to prevent China’s internationally wrongful conduct from becoming viewed as generally accepted and acceptable.”“If a state objects to a claim such as China’s here does not react in time and properly, it may be deemed to have acquiesced to China’s claim and over time the legal expectation arises that what China’s doing is actually lawful,” he said. “And so, to prevent this process from kicking in, the United States and other countries … send military vessels through waters that are contested [to prevent a precedent from being established]. This is why these freedom of navigation operations are very important.”Meantime, a U.S. Navy spokesperson denied the U.S.S. Benfold had been expelled from the region.“U.S. Navy vessels routinely interact with foreign warships and aircraft,” the spokesperson told Polygraph.info.“All interactions with USS Benfold were in accordance with international law and did not interfere with scheduled operations.”";https://www.c7f.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/2690119/7th-fleet-conducts-freedom-of-navigation-operation/#.YOvjAOKQnxQ.twitter,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm,https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part4.htm,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-expansionism-south-china-sea/31217558.html,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1891450.shtml;'Expelled’ U.S. Destroyer Violated International Law in South China Sea?

It listed 37 heads of state and governments who, it says, “crack down massively on press freedom.”RSF named Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his government among the “predators,” for having “developed several ways to pressure journalists.”According to RSF, the Philippines’ record includes a campaign of “grotesque judicial harassment against the news website Rappler and its editor, Maria Ressa”; the targeting of the Philippine Daily Inquirer; the refusal to renew the ABS-CBN network’s congressional franchise, which television and radio stations must have to operate; and online harassment “by pro-Duterte troll armies.”Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque dismissed the allegations. Recent press reports implicating the Philippine government in drug-war killings, followed by calls from former International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate the government’s involvement, prove that media in the country remains free, Roque said.“Absolutely bereft of merit,” Roque said of the RSF report. “If you look at the ICC prosecutor's findings, all he [sic] quotes is media critical of the government. So that proves that freedom of the press is alive and well in the Philippines.”Filipino activists and relatives of people killed in the country's war on drugs hold a rally in observance of Human Rights Day in Manila, on December 10, 2019. Reuters/Eloisa LopezThat is misleading. The existence of independent press and attempts to crack down on critical journalism are not mutually exclusive. Duterte’s administration specifically targeted media outlets that investigated the government’s “war on drugs,” RSF said.Reporters Without Borders is not alone in criticizing Duterte. Other press freedom organizations reported on his government’s systematic attempts to suppress independent media in Philippines.The Philippine Daily Inquirer, ABS-CBN and Rappler had all “proactively investigated the rising number of deaths from the government ‘war on drugs’,” Duterte subsequently singled them out in 2017, the non-profit Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) said.The PCIJ said the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated “the crisis of limited information and government control which had been going on with democratic decline.”The U.S.-based rights group Freedom House reported that Duterte’s “hostile rhetoric toward members of the media” has worsened an already “perilous situation” in “one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists.”The attacks on media violate the Philippines constitution, which “provides for freedoms of expression and the press,” Freedom House said.The PCIJ documented 228 attacks and threats against journalists in 2016-2020, and 19 killings of journalists in 2016-2021.Being a journalist does not “exempt you from assassination,” and media members would not be killed if they didn’t “do anything wrong,” Duterte said infamously during a June 2016 press conference as president-elect when asked how he would handle the murder of journalists.In September 2020, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines launched the Masked Media campaign against what they called Duterte’s efforts “to suppress freedom of the press and pervert the truth.”At the time, Len Olea of the online publication Bulatlat told LiCAS.news, a Bangkok-based Catholic news agency, that since becoming president in 2016, Duterte had increasingly used the Philippines judiciary to suppress independent journalism. At least 23 media personalities had been hit with libel, cyber libel or other charges, Olea said.Chief among those singled out is Ressa, who, as CEO and Executive Editor of Rappler, was named a Time magazine Person of the Year in 2018 and listed among the “Guardians” fighting against “the War on Truth.”According to RSF, Ressa “has been the target of at least ten arrest warrants on a range of charges, all equally far-fetched.” A Manila court convicted Ressa in a high-profile cyber libel case in June 2020, prompting international criticism.The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights’ spokesperson said Ressa’s prosecution fit into “a pattern of intimidation” against an independent media outlet that “fiercely guarded its independence and its right to conduct in-depth investigations and to criticize the authorities.”After Ressa was acquitted on June 3 in a separate cyber libel case, Roque said that Duterte himself had never filed a libel case against any journalist critical of him.Ressa responded that “actions speak louder than words,” noting that social media attacks and the prosecution of her media outlet followed Duterte’s attack on Rappler during his July 2017 State of the Nation address. In it, Duterte claimed Rappler is owned by ""Americans"" in violation of the Philippines’ constitution.Rappler faced several tax and libel cases amid attacks by Duterte, who labeled the outlet “fake news.”The Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revoked Rappler’s articles of incorporation for allegedly violating constitutional provisions on foreign ownership and control.Rappler had issued Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDR) to the U.S.-based non-profit Omidyar Network as a source of funding.According to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a PDR holder has “the right to ‘own’ the stocks of a company and to receive their dividends or interest,” but the actual title over the stock stays with the company.The Omidyar Network, set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, has also provided funding to RSF.The SEC has allowed Rappler to continue operating, saying it is free to “exhaust legal remedies” before the decision to revoke its media license is final.The Manila-based Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) quoted major Philippines' press organizations as calling the move a “pattern of restricting criticism.”In 2017, Duterte sought to block the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise after it failed to run his campaign ads in the 2016 presidential election.During a Senate hearing in February 2020, ABS-CBN apologized to Duterte for not running the ads. At the time, Duterte claimed he had not attempted to influence any member of the House of Representatives to block the broadcaster’s bid to renew its 25-year license.Less than three months later, the Philippines’ National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease-and-desist order after ABS-CBN’s franchise expired. On July 10, 2020, the House of Representatives moved not to renew it.New York-based Human Rights Watch linked that to the network’s critical coverage of the government’s drug war.In February 2021, Duterte said he would not allow the broadcaster — the oldest in Southeast Asia and the largest in the Philippines — to operate even if granted a new franchise.CMFR said the ABS-CBN saga delivered “a message to every media company” that Duterte could do the same to other news outlets, “which would then spell the end of press freedom under this administration.”Duterte also repeatedly accused the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which publishes a bi-weekly list of suspected drug dealers and users killed in the drug war, of tax evasion, among other offenses.A controlling stake in the Philippine Daily Inquirer’s parent company, the Inquirer Group of Companies, was sold to tycoon Ramon See Ang in 2017.Ang has publicly supported Duterte’s war on drugs.Rappler quoted an unnamed source as saying the previous owners had been “bullied” into selling the controlling stake.";https://rsf.org/en/philippines,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-phillipines-duterte-drug-war/31318955.html,https://pcij.org/article/5208/2021-state-of-press-freedom-in-the-philippines,https://freedomhouse.org/country/philippines/freedom-world/2021,https://pcij.org/article/5208/2021-state-of-press-freedom-in-the-philippines,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-journalists/philippines-duterte-denounced-for-defending-killing-of-some-journalists-idUSKCN0YN3TK,https://www.facebook.com/nujphil/posts/10164169156965374,https://www.licas.news/2020/09/23/masked-media-campaign-highlights-repression-of-press-freedom-in-philippines/,https://time.com/5793800/maria-ressa-the-guardians-100-women-of-the-year/,https://www.untvweb.com/news/malacanang-reminds-critics-cyberlibel-act-passed-under-aquino-administration/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/philippines-quash-conviction-of-rappler-ressa-santos/,https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/80936/philippines-statement-spokesperson-conviction-maria-ressa-and-reynaldo-santos_en,https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24171&LangID=E,https://pnl-law.com/blog/decision-in-people-vs-reynaldo-santos-jr-maria-angelita-ressa-and-rappler-re-online-libel-full-text/,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/libel-case-dismissed-philippines-journalist-still-faces-legal-challenges,https://www.rappler.com/nation/full-text-president-rodrigo-duterte-sona-2017-philippines,https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-fake-news-outlet,https://usa.inquirer.net/9632/omidyar-network-invest-rappler,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/964554/rappler-asks-sc-to-annul-sec-decision-to-revoke-its-registration,https://omidyar.com/news/reporters-without-borders-launches-forbidden-stories-project/,https://www.rappler.com/business/sec-rappler-revoke-license-appeal,https://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/journalism-review/the-rappler-sec-ruling-corporate-issues-politics-and-press-freedom/?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=73353a94016f084c706cd697c347c0c070212687-1625753045-0-AdrZR7l4c5CmSn-QqaKUC2Xu6cmi1XJNu8_qb5FHWCKHqyF28qZiy8edmwWjvOK5ORTryilXt3wD4tq6hGIlt-3nh4Vx8tKHRvVCKk_Eii-nKSov8eFHyhP0oOLDhiGRnGmg0XaLBe7ZJePbcMB8EQWgHC5jb3GqvCQX3MB7vd6ppd-M9Y76jYOtNdSEVYOZcdkVR6CUDVKNZaxLnodOduXwrZOUVXqApIdIsChl1snmm-fzz2J8Vokxe8wEWn5n-N-KjP0Csx3TYVYnyMjaDCFuyJH3ZqIPHfUqHvxrscUtJx3ZkGjw84VMr1H2SxzfWIaUpNIcegyTl8nMJybw-ZrTDTZXKVnx9gsYWJUwLWq2JDiEsFi2_NYFttZG7rZ4UzMrgu-I4ewGpmptBFY63cMBxwcbi8QdzE-Aod4GrVBUXZzh5Wd3Rz4mJTcJu_m8hzpM6e0XMGEAEDJja5uVD2GRaDPemy1eTK4HLD5ky1HinWBkaaI379nQ1x009rRJerYSKfHUb7fzha03fY7ANsxH05Y2-mabQAwpslddBa9my0sgbY2b4NdbGAL46A9DvVgcrf1n5MRgTzr7PKzag-tILBLIKoY3MIuSxhQ_BnIGlhmopdBNR1ov1s2S9qeSZS04wAuID-tzFrF96szWPe1zt0qaFj2OmkFPddLroWcY4dio2Jtp1s5f8ykp_yZhbvAveW38LER2lOGwlrzNxxQjbFNHLyWO88RR8YIaiCZ0YgqbzhfaYGAiEWfxtZ0laTzDzPUasSffbCDVkQkKn_t19yYUW4XNR2wabxmRkdH6kWRIEIE_omoDG9dQdokUOQ,https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/08/18/duterte-to-object-to-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1233949/duterte-to-abs-cbn-apology-accepted-but-franchise-up-to-house,https://theaseanpost.com/article/why-did-congress-deny-abs-cbn-franchise,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/13/philippines-drug-war-killings-rise-during-pandemic#,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1130056,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/duterte-target-philippine-daily-inquirer,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/794598/kill-list-drugs-duterte,https://cnnphilippines.com/business/2017/11/22/ramon-ang-complete-philippine-daily-inquirer-deal.html,https://www.rappler.com/business/business-duterte-friend-ramon-ang-san-miguel,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/duterte-target-philippine-daily-inquirer;Duterte Spokesman Protests ‘Press Freedom Predator’ Label;;;;;;

On July 6, Bloomberg reported that a Russian intelligence-linked hacker group had breached computer systems used by the Republican National Committee. The attack, attributed to Cozy Bear, also known as APT 29, came around the same time as a wider Russia-linked ransomware attack on a U.S. technology firm, Kaseya VSA, that affected hundreds of American and European companies. No link between the two attacks has been reported.Bloomberg initially reported that an RNC spokesman had denied the breach had taken place. However, after the story was published, RNC chief of staff Richard Walters told the news agency that Symnex Corp., a California-based IT services contractor used by the RNC, had in fact been breached. The RNC did not say whether any data was stolen or otherwise compromised. Russia’s Foreign Ministry seized on the RNC’s initial denial of an attack, with the Russian Embassy in Washington D.C. denying any involvement in the attack and questioning whether the RNC attack had taken place. ""We paid attention to the publication by Bloomberg on July 6 about the alleged breach by ‘Russian government hackers’ of the computer systems of the Republican National Committee. We strongly reject such fabrications,"" Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency quoted the embassy as saying on July 7. The embassy added that “the party itself denied the fact of a cyber attack” and “there is no evidence that the attack took place,” TASS reported. That is misleading.Bloomberg noted in an updated version of the article that the RNC had acknowledged the hack after the article was first published. However, the Russian embassy has not corrected its statement claiming the RNC denied that an attack took place. More importantly, TASS continued to report the embassy’s misleading claim with no correction. While the embassy’s statement was released on July 6, the same day as the Bloomberg piece, the TASS article citing that statement wasn’t published until the next day. After the incident, the RNC said it severed connections between Symnex and its own cloud servers, and that it was working with Microsoft to determine which data, if any, was compromised. Symnex admitted outsiders had “attempted” to gain access but could provide no details while a “review” was being conducted.Other media outlets also reported the RNC breach on 6-7 July, including the Washington Post, NY Times, and NPR. Among those, Washington Post cited two anonymous sources who told them that APT29 was involved in the attack. APT29, which stands for Active Persistent Threat and is more popularly known as “Cozy Bear,” is a hacker collective believed to be associated with Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The group has been implicated in several high-profile cyber-attacks on U.S. and other Western targets since 2014, including the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s servers in 2016. It is also believed to have been behind the recent cyber-attack on SolarWinds, a company whose clients include U.S. federal government agencies. Cyber-security was among the main topics that U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed during their summit in Geneva on June 16. Earlier, ransomware attacks linked to Russia-based hackers had shut down the largest U.S. oil pipeline system and a major meat-processing plant. After the talks, President Biden claimed he’d made Putin aware that future Russian cyber-attacks would have consequences. Russia said that, as a result of the Geneva talks, the two countries would launch a dialogue on cyber-security cooperation.The JBS meat placing plant is viewed in Plainwell, Michigan on June 2, 2021. An American subsidiary of Brazilian meat processor JBS told the U.S. government that it has received a ransom demand in a cyberattack it believes originated in Russia.";https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?srnd=premium&sref=KQPtNSUL,https://washington.mid.ru/en/press-centre/news/comment_by_the_embassy_of_the_russian_federation_in_the_usa_with_regard_to_news_about_alleged_breach/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/russia-cozy-bear-breached-gop-as-ransomware-attack-hit/2021/07/06/3e9e200a-de9b-11eb-a27f-8b294930e95b_story.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/technology/rnc-hacked-cyberattack-russia.html,https://www.npr.org/2021/07/06/1013545363/russians-tried-to-hack-republican-national-committee,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack ,https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF;Russia’s U.S. Embassy Distorts What Happened in Republican Party Cyber-Attack;;;;;;

The people of Sardasht still suffer from “pain and torment” caused by the “brutal attack,” said Fernando Arias, Director General of the United Nations’ Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), on June 28.Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons not only in Iran but also against Iraqi citizens, targeting the country’s Kurdish population. The U.S. State Department estimated in a 2003 report that, in 1987-1988, Iraq’s military used chemical weapons against 40 Kurdish villages, turning them into a “testing ground.”The report said local victims suffered life-long health complications. A March 1988 attack in the city of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan killed about 5,000 people and injured more than 10,000.On the Sardasht attack anniversary, Iranian government and military officials blamed Europe and the U.S. for helping Saddam obtain technology and components to develop chemical weapons. Iranian officials said the victims of those attacks are still waiting for justice.""The crimes of the Europeans in the chemical attack on our country and even on the Iraqis themselves, like in the case of Halabja, were not sued in any courts,” said Brig. Gen. Reza Jalali, head of Iran's Passive Defense Organization (Cyber Defense Command).The statement is misleading.In fact, there have been investigations, and European and American companies and persons who supplied the Iraqis have been prosecuted in U.S. and European courts.An international investigation into Saddam’s acquisition of chemical weapons led to the 2004 arrest of a Dutch citizen, Frans van Anraat, in the Netherlands. In December 2005, the International Court of Justice in The Hague found Van Anraat guilty of complicity in war crimes and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. In 2007, the Court of Appeals in The Hague increased his sentence to 17 years.European prosecutors learned from U.S. officials that the Dutchman nicknamed “Chemical Frans” was Saddam Hussein’s source for raw ingredients. In 1989, the U.S. government issued an international request for Van Anraat’s arrest and extradition. He had become a suspect a year earlier, when an undercover U.S. customs agent discovered a supply chain created to hide the shipment of hundreds of tons of thiodiglycol, a.k.a. TDG, a key component of mustard gas.According to U.S. prosecutors, the TDG cargo would first sail to Rotterdam or Antwerp, where the barrels were reloaded onto a different vessel and shipped to Jordan’s port of Aqaba. From there, trucks would drive the chemical cargo across the desert to Iraq.The International Court of Justice in The Hague found Van Anraat guilty of complicity in war crimes and sentenced him to 15 years in prison.Van Anraat, whom the U.S. investigators described as the last man in the network directly dealing with the Iraqis, operated the chain via an umbrella network of commercial firms. He used a New York City shell firm called NuKraft to order thiodiglycol from a Baltimore, Maryland, manufacturing company, Alcolac (a subsidiary of the British conglomerate Rio Tinto Zinc), which sold TDG under the trade name Kromfax.U.S. government agencies warned Alcolac about the restrictions on exporting thiodiglycol to Iraq, Iran, Syria, and other countries known to be pursuing development of chemical weapons, PBS reported. In 1987-1988, Alcolac sold NuKraft four shipments of Kromfax totaling more than 1 million pounds, the investigation concluded.In 1989, Alcolac pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Export Administration Act. However, it claimed it had not known that the thiodiglycol was ending up in Iraq, or that the Iraqi government was using it to manufacture chemical weapons, stating that TGB has many legal commercial uses, including ink production and textile dyeing.In 2011, victims and surviving family members of the Kurdish chemical attacks filed a class- action lawsuit under a U.S. law known as the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), accusing Alcolac of genocide and war crimes. A U.S. appeals court ruled that the prosecutors were unable to provide evidence that Alcolac sold TDG to Iraq with the intention of supporting the regime’s manufacture of chemical weapons. Still, the court ruled that the facts presented were true.Alcolac is now defunct, its assets having been sold off to Rhodia, a French chemicals concern. However, Alcolac remains a target of litigation. In 2017, Victor Alcaron, a U.S. Army Gulf War veteran, brought a new suit against Alcolac, claiming he was exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons while deployed in Iraq and that the poison gas seriously damaged his lungs.U.S. investigators discovered a parallel supply chain, which prompted the German government to launch its own separate investigation and prosecution of Saddam’s dealers. In 1982, Alcolac sold 120 tons of Kromfax (thiodiglycol) to a German company, Colimex, and the order was transshipped through Singapore to Iraq.According to “The Poison Gas Connection,” a report produced jointly by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a California-based international group for Holocaust remembrance, and Paris-based Middle East Defense News, 207 Western firms had sold chemical and biological weapons components to Iraq by 1989. Germany was the main supplier, the report concluded.The German authorities investigated 170 domestic companies for aiding Saddam Hussein’s pursuit of chemical weapons, and 25 cases resulted in criminal proceedings.Although Alcolac was the best-known supplier, a class action lawsuit filed in 2011 stated that 18 U.S. companies “provided Iraq’s weapons programs with assistance” in the form of computers and technology.In 2013, Foreign Policy magazine, citing unclassified CIA documents, reported that the administration of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan supported Iraq in the war against Iran and provided intelligence data about the location and movement of Iranian troops.The U.S. has said, however, that it did not know of Saddam Hussein’s plans to use chemical weapons.";https://www.rferl.org/a/1073150.html,http://www.tehranpeacemuseum.org/files/pdf%20resources/English%20Text-%20chemical%20warfare.pdf,https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2021/06/statement-director-general-opcw-fernando-arias-commemorate-1987-chemical,https://www.dw.com/en/profile-iraqi-president-saddam-hussein/a-813163,https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/18714.htm,https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/462552/Zarif-commemorates-victims-of-Sardasht-chemical-bombardment,https://en.mehrnews.com/news/175426/Sardasht-chemical-attack-showed-West-is-not-trustworthy,https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/iranian-cyber-threat-structure,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/arming.html,http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/178/Van-Anraat/,http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=2243,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4358741.stm,http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/325b01495bb950f6b36639fbd45090a4,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/arming.html,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/arming.html,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/10-1908/101908.p-2011-09-19.html,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gulf-war-syndrome-lawsuit-chemical-warfares-lingering-fallout,http://kentimmerman.com/krt/PoisonGas.pdfc,https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/10-1908/101908.p-2011-09-19.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/;Iran Distorts History of Iraqi Chemical Attacks' Aftermath;;;;;;

In schools in a number of Western countries, children are convinced as part of their curriculum that Jesus Christ was bisexual.” Yes, that’s what he wrote. And it’s false. As Lavrov gave no examples of which countries or schools allegedly have such a curriculum, journalists took up the search.Initially, suspicion fell on a TikTok video. The video shows a mother in Australia talking to her 4-year-old son, who declares that Jesus was “bi and non-binary” (the latter is a gender identity that is neither male nor female).The woman asks her son: “Did they teach you that at school?” He responds yes, to which she pushes back, saying: “That it is not true.” The boy insists it is true.In a story on controversy over Lavrov’s statement, the Intercept wrote:“As his mother, a TikTok influencer who studied acting at art school, films herself reacting theatrically, the boy reasons that Jesus must be bisexual ‘because he loves everyone in the world’ and nonbinary ‘because he wears a dress and he’s a man’.” As some publications zeroed in on the TikTok video, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova tried damage control on her personal Facebook page.“In fact, the information in the [Lavrov] article was not based on the ‘Tik-Tok video,’ but on publications in the Western media,” Zakharova wrote.“Take an example: the Christian news portal Christian Today. Its editorial office is located in London, with a branch in New York. Monthly reach – 3 million unique visitors. Christian Today featured a play by the Scottish Teachers Union that portrays Jesus as a transgender person.”Problem is, that doesn’t back up Lavrov.True, the Education Institute of Scotland, a major teachers’ union, was planning a Pride month event to feature scenes from a play in which Jesus was reimagined as a present day trans woman. But this involved the activities of a teachers’ union, not the content of any school curriculum.The play, titled “The Gospel of Jesus, Queen of Heaven,” faced protests from religious groups when it debuted in 2009. Its writer and sole performer, Jo Clifford, identifies as a practicing Christian and told the BBC she had no intention of mocking or offending Christian churches.;https://www.tiktok.com/@emmalinecs/video/6966905230722075906?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmeduza.io%2F&referer_video_id=6966905230722075906&refer=embed&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/01/russias-top-diplomat-pushes-false-claim-western-schools-teach-kids-jesus-bisexual/,https://www.facebook.com/maria.zakharova.167/posts/10226392595710912,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/06/11/play-jesus-trans-woman-jo-clifford-christian-institute-outrage/,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-34766340;Lavrov’s Weird Claim: Western Schools Teach ‘Jesus Was Bisexual.’;;;;;;

It’s Not What Hong Kong Claims;2021-06-23;polygraph;;"Following a recent raid by security officials, the arrest of senior staff and an asset freeze, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily announced on Monday, June 21, that its closure is imminent.After months of pressure, the hammer fell on June 17, when 500 police swarmed Apple Daily’s office, arresting five executives and seizing $2.3 million in Apple's assets, leaving the paper unable to pay its staff.On Wednesday, June 23, a columnist for the paper was also arrested, “on suspicion of conspiring to collude with a foreign country,” Reuters reported.Ryan Law, the chief editor of Apple Daily; Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of Next Digital, Apple Daily’s parent company; and three companies related to Apple Daily are being prosecuted for breaching Hong Kong’s National Security Law (NSL).Ryan Law (second from right), Apple Daily's chief editor, is arrested by police officers on June 17, 2021. APAccording to Reuters, Law and Cheung were charged with ""collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security” and denied bail on grounds they are likely to reoffend. Two Apple Daily senior editors and another executive detained June 17 have yet to be charged and were released.Apple Daily was founded by media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai, who is currently imprisoned for his role in unauthorized demonstrations. Lai is also the first high-profile person charged under the security law.Lai was accused of calling on a foreign country or institution to “impose sanctions on blockade, or engage in other hostile activities” against China or Hong Kong, National Public Radio reports, citing the Apple Daily.Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the Apple Daily, is arrested by police officers at his home in Hong Kong on April 18, 2020. AP/Vincent YuAfter widespread criticism of the Apple Daily arrests, Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam dismissed allegations the executives were arrested for their journalistic work, stressing the government’s desire to implement the national security law.“What we are talking about is not exchanging views between foreigners and journalists. It is violating the law as defined in the national security law and based on very clear evidence which will bring the case to court,” China’s state-run CGTN cited Lam as saying.“Don't try to underplay the significance of breaching the national security law, and don't try to beautify these acts of endangering national security, which the foreign governments have taken so much to their heart.”That is misleading. As rights monitors have noted, the vague nature of the NSL makes it possible to criminalize numerous forms of free speech and journalistic activity under the pretext of national security.Prior to passage of the law last year, Hong Kong had a free press. Even China’s “One Country, Two Systems” principle provided for freedom “of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief.”Unhappiness with China’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s relative independence culminated in the 2019-2020 protest movement, which at its height drew an estimated quarter of the city's 7.5 million people to the streets.Those protests were sparked by a since-tabled extradition bill that would have allowed for Hong Kongers to be sent to mainland China to face trial. The protests sparked a harsh reaction from Beijing, which has severely limited the judicial, legislative and civic autonomy that Hong Kong previously enjoyed under the joint declaration.The NSL was one such measure. Passed on June 30, 2020, the NSL criminalizes four categories of activities — secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and collusion with foreign entities. The law also gives authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing far-reaching power to control the internet, media outlets, schools and other civil organizations.The independent online news outlet Hong Kong Free Press said the NSL’s “catch-all wording” gives the government power to criminalize political views, including “advocating for independence, autonomy or international sanctions.”The U.K. rights group Amnesty International likewise found the NSL “is dangerously vague and broad,” as “virtually anything could be deemed a threat” under the law. Beijing maintains the law applies even to nonresident Hong Kongers, or “anyone on the planet,” Amnesty said.A recent Georgetown Center for Asian Law report said the “vast majority” of the 105 people arrested under the law from July 1, 2020, to January 14, 2021, “would not be considered national security cases in other liberal constitutional jurisdictions.”The Georgetown report said this has created a “climate of fear,” with self-censorship undermining the “core basic political rights of free expression, free assembly, and free association,” which are being “heavily restricted” in ways not seen prior to the law’s enactment.The law’s “core provisions are vague,” making it difficult to predict what can and cannot be said, the report concluded.The situation has forced journalists to engage in self-censorship for fear that publications will be held criminally liable for what they print. That is apparent in the Apple Daily case, as well as the censoring of articles that merely reported on the potential effects of Western sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese government officials.Such articles could potentially “run afoul of the NSL,” the Georgetown report noted.New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) called the security law “Beijing’s most aggressive assault on Hong Kong people’s freedoms since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.”It noted that Hong Kongers now faced imprisonment for possessing or displaying banners, flags or other printed materials that promote Hong Kong’s independence. Chanting similar slogans is also now forbidden. HRW reported that a man was charged with “inciting subversion” and “terrorism” after he collided with a group of officers on his motorcycle while carrying a banner that read “Liberate Hong Kong.”The Georgetown report found that 12 of the initial NSL arrests were “pure” free speech cases that involved chanting or displaying pro-independence slogans without any connection to other alleged crimes.Freedom House, a human rights group partially funded by the U.S. government, said the NSL was being used to “smother a local tradition of independent reporting.”Apart from the Apple Daily crackdown, Freedom House noted a series of visa denials for foreign journalists, a redefinition of “media representative” that sharply limits who is considered a journalist, and other cases of self-censorship by media outlets to avoid running afoul of the law.";https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/19/editor-ceo-denied-bail-in-apple-daily-case-in-hong-kong.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kongs-apple-daily-newspaper-says-police-arrest-five-directors-2021-06-16/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kongs-apple-daily-newspaper-says-police-arrest-five-directors-2021-06-16/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/hk-police-arrest-apple-daily-journalist-under-national-security-law-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/hk-police-arrest-apple-daily-journalist-under-national-security-law-.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/crowds-gather-hearing-two-apple-daily-executives-national-security-charge-2021-06-19/,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/19/editor-ceo-denied-bail-in-apple-daily-case-in-hong-kong.html,https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-fb9d50c6fe77ee7fff0cde930bd67309,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55271020,https://www.npr.org/2020/12/12/945838541/hong-kong-democracy-activist-jimmy-lai-denied-bail,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/hong-kong-huge-rally-china-condemns-us-gross-interference,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-uk-hong-kong-freedom/31309459.html,https://hongkongfp.com/2020/12/26/hong-kong-reels-after-the-year-that-free-speech-died/,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/hong-kong-national-security-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/law-asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2021/02/GT-HK-Report-Accessible.pdf,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/07/29/china-new-hong-kong-law-roadmap-repression#,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-uk-hong-kong-freedom/31309459.html,https://freedomhouse.org/article/hong-kong-press-freedom-suffocates-under-beijings-national-security-law;Why Is Apple Daily Closing?

But since Biden’s announcement, Afghan officials say the Taliban has launched attacks that took the lives of hundreds of government security forces, civilians and Taliban insurgents. President Joe Biden speaks from the Treaty Room in the White House on Wednesday, April 14, 2021, about the withdrawal of the remainder of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.Citing Afghan security officials, Reuters reported that in the first 15 days following the announcement, the Taliban planted 65 roadside bombs, launched six suicide attacks and carried out several targeted killings.In a string of tweets, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem conveyed a statement by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the group’s co-founder and deputy leader, saying that it is committed to peace and the rights of women and minorities within Islamic law. ""Our very participation in the negotiations and its support on our part indicates openly that we believe in resolving issues through (mutual) understanding,” Baradar’s statement read. But given the violence, perpetrated by Taliban and sympathizers, that is misleading. Rather than search for common ground, the Taliban have rushed to seize territory. The Associated Press reported on June 22 that dozens of Afghan jurisdictions have fallen into Taliban’s hands since May 1, the most recent being Imam Sahib, a key district in northern Kunduz province. The district is near the Tajikistan border with Tajikistan and on a key supply route from Central Asia.The Taliban have seized control of 40 districts since the U.S. announced withdrawal, adding to the 80 districts already in its grip, and it is fighting to take control of another 180 districts. Afghan Commando forces are seen at the site of a battle field where they clash with the Taliban insurgent in Kunduz province, June 22, 2021.Taliban forces recently overran an Afghan military base and killed Col. Sohrab Azimi, the commander of U.S.-trained special Afghan forces, and 22 of his men. The loss of the 31-year-old Azimi triggered a wave of anger and fear for the country’s future.Afghanistan’s defense ministry said on June 19 that its troops have retreated from several districts as the Taliban advanced. However, it denied reports of Afghan soldiers surrendering. In response to the surge in Taliban violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani replaced two officials responsible for security in the country – the defense and interior ministers.The United States and the Taliban, also known as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, signed an agreement in February 2020 initiating intra-Afghan talks and a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops. The Taliban committed to prevent Afghan territory from being used to launch terror attacks against U.S. and allied troops. The talks kicked off last September in Qatar’s capital Doha with the goal of ending decades of conflict, drawing up a roadmap for peace and reaching a permanent ceasefire. The Doha talks recently stalled, however, and the Taliban are widely blamed for the deadlock. The U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, told the Security Council on June 22 that the country is sliding toward “dire scenarios.” The Afghan president called anti-Taliban militias to rally in the face the sweeping Taliban offensive. Although anti-Taliban militias pledged allegiance to the government, the call to arms raised fears that the country could plunge into a civil war.Afghan militiamen join Afghan defense and security forces during a gathering in Kabul, June 23, 2021.The Taliban have refused to allow any foreign forces to remain in Afghanistan to secure diplomatic missions and the Kabul international airport. On June 12, the Taliban said no foreign military presence would be permitted in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of the U.S. and 10,000 NATO security forces pulling out at the same time.“Every inch of Afghan soil, its airports and security of foreign embassies and diplomatic offices is the responsibility of the Afghans, consequently no one should hold out hope of keeping military or security presence in our country, nor should steps be taken that could strain relations between peoples and countries,” the Taliban’s statement read. President Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, will meet with Biden in the White House on June 25 to discuss the U.S. troop withdrawal and surge in Taliban violence.On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters the withdrawal process is on pace, adding that Pentagon officials are monitoring the situation in Afghanistan to be sure it is “the appropriate pace” for a “safe and orderly” exit.";https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/14/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-way-forward-in-afghanistan/,https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2573268/biden-announces-full-us-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-by-sept-11/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-violence-idUSKBN2CG25S,https://twitter.com/IeaOffice/status/1406584737876090883?s=20,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-say-committed-afghan-peace-talks-want-genuine-islamic-system-2021-06-20/,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-taliban-2b1f92ab572a905521fab2644922c307,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/taliban-gains-afghan-territory-may-seek-complete-return-to-power-amid-us-withdrawal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-taliban-commando-killed/2021/06/19/ebd748fc-d03e-11eb-a224-bd59bd22197c_story.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/19/afghan-president-replaces-security-ministers-amid-taliban-advance,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/9/12/in-pictures-historic-intra-afghan-talks-formally-launch-in-qatar,https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/chief-taliban-negotiator-renews-commitment-afghan-peace-womens-rights,https://unama.unmissions.org/un-envoy-lyons-briefing-security-council-situation-afghanistan-2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-militias-taliban/2021/06/22/f8fa35c0-d34b-11eb-b39f-05a2d776b1f4_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-militias-taliban/2021/06/22/f8fa35c0-d34b-11eb-b39f-05a2d776b1f4_story.html,https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2572781/austin-says-nato-us-forces-will-leave-afghanistan-continue-support-to-afghan-fo/,https://www.aljazeera.net/news/politics/2021/6/12/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9-%D9%86%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%86,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/20/statement-by-white-house-spokesperson-jen-psaki-on-the-visit-of-president-ashraf-ghani-of-afghanistan-and-dr-abdullah-abdullah-chairman-of-the-high-council-for-national-reconciliation/,https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2665540/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing/,https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2665540/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing/;Taliban Violence Undermines Claim to Seek Mutual ‘Understanding’;;;;;;

We are committed to support the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and we stand together to impose costs on the regime for its blatant disregard of international commitments.”Belarusian Chief of the Air Force and Air Defense Command of the Armed Forces Igar Golub (L), Belarusian activist Raman Pratasevich (C) and Chairman of the Investigative Committee of Belarus Dzmitry Gara appear before a media briefing.That same day, Belarusian state media addressed the sanctions without mentioning the Ryanair incident, arbitrary arrests or human rights more generally.The Belta news agency quoted Belarusian Economic Minister Aleksandr Chervyakov as claiming that the sanctions were driven by economic, not “political” motives. “Western sanctions are likely to be linked not to some political issues, but to the fact that the economy of Belarus has survived, while Europe has suffered huge losses due to the lockdown, Belarus' Economy Minister Aleksandr Chervyakov said in an interview to the ONT TV channel,” the article stated.The article further quoted Chervyakov as saying that a reason for the new sanctions “is that economic issues were hidden under the pretext of the political ones.” “If we analyze the global experience of applying sanctions, none of the sanctions have achieved their political goals,” he was quoted as saying. “But those sanctions have been hiding other things - issues related to the division of markets and the pushing out of competitors. We can see the same processes against Belarus today.” These claims are false. As the joint statement by the U.S. U.K., Canada and EU stated explicitly, the new sanctions against Belarus were imposed because of the Ryanair incident and other violations of human rights and international norms.Nor is Belarus much of a threat when it comes to economic competition. As Business News Europe (BNE) recently reported, the Belarusian economy is in critical condition. In addition to the ongoing protests against Lukashenko’s disputed re-election last August, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken an economic toll on Belarus, as elsewhere. Lukashenko dismissed the threat posed by the pandemic and, ignoring international criticism, did not introduce a lockdown. The country also suffered indirectly from the global economic downturn due to lower prices for its exports, including potash and chemical fertilizers.And despite the friendly relationship between Moscow and Minsk, a tax dispute effectively ended what BNE called the “generous energy subsidies” Russia gave to Belarus. BNE also noted that Belarus depends on imports for consumer goods – a factor the Belta article ignored.“To compensate for these losses, there will be an urgent need to work hard on the domestic market, including on reducing production costs, and on import substitution,” BNE wrote. Import substitution was a rallying cry in Russia after Western sanctions were imposed because of its intervention in Ukraine in 2014. But even there, in a country far more industrialized than Belarus, the results have been mixed.While Russia is Belarus’ main trading partner, EU countries like Lithuania, Poland and Germany are also significant. So is Ukraine, which joined EU states in passing sanctions against Belarusian officials last November.Although the Belta article downplays the significance of the new Western sanctions, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry’s reaction to the announcement of sanctions differed greatly from Belta's description.“According to Aleksandr Chervyakov, Belarus takes the sanctions of the West calmly,” the Belta story stated.However, according to The Associated Press, the Belarus Foreign Ministry called the sanctions “a declaration of economic war.” The latest Western sanctions against Belarus were imposed after Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair airliner traveling from Athens to Vilnius via Belarus to divert and land at Minsk International Airport due to a phony bomb threat.After the plane landed, Belarusian police arrested opposition Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen, before allowing the plane to leave for its final destination.;https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-belarus/,https://www.intellinews.com/belarus-economy-will-collapse-without-russia-s-help-212168/,https://tass.com/economy/1288793,https://jamestown.org/program/import-substitution-in-russia-failing-as-moscow-buys-products-not-technologies/,https://www.kyivpost.com/eastern-europe/ukraine-joins-eu-sanctions-against-belarus-as-eu-plans-more-sanctions.html,https://apnews.com/article/belarus-europe-business-government-and-politics-ed83d442ddf5406397b0e501d7d928d3,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-fact-check-belarus-makes-bizarre-new-claims-to-defend-hijacking-flight-/31295008.html;Belarus Says Sanctions Aim To Steal Markets, But It’s Really About Air Piracy;;;;;;

In Iran’s system of government, the elected president is not the head of state. That role is filled by the Supreme Leader, in this case Ayatollah Khamenei, who has held the position since 1989. The Supreme Leader is chosen by the Assembly of Experts, a group of Islamic scholars. The Supreme Leader is also commander-in-chief of the country’s military, and appoints members of the Guardian Council, the body that approves or rejects presidential candidates. The Supreme Leader also signs off on the presidential candidate who wins the election, thus inaugurating them as president after an election. In theory, Khamenei could withhold that signature, in effect rejecting the winning candidate. Although the president of Iran does exercise influence over domestic and foreign policy, any initiative is subject to approval by the Supreme Leader.People seeking to run for president are either approved or rejected by the Guardian Council, six of whose members are appointed by the Supreme Leader.In the latest election, nearly 600 people registered their candidacy, but only seven were accepted. The overwhelming winner was hardline conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who currently heads Iran’s judicial system. Raisi is believed to have strong ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a paramilitary organization that wields great influence in the country and is answerable only to the Supreme Leader. In 1988, Raisi served on a panel that handed down death sentences to thousands of dissidents after the Iran-Iraq War. His three opponents in the presidential election included a former IRGC commander, a former head of the country’s central bank, and the deputy speaker of Iran’s parliament. Three other approved candidates had dropped out by June 16.According to the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington D.C.-based research group, the lack of popularity of Raisi’s opponents has led some experts to conclude that the Guardian Council may have manipulated the election in favor of Raisi.It is hard to consider the election “sound” given the many eligibility restrictions imposed on candidates. For example, a candidate must be between 40 and 75 years old, and a Shiite Muslim, effectively barring religious minorities. Women are not explicitly barred from running, but all 40 women who registered as candidates in this election were rejected, like all other past female candidates.Government control of the media also has a major influence on Iran’s elections.These restrictions have led some Iranians to call for a boycott. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (a U.S. government-funded sister news agency to the Voice of America) reported that many Iranians feel their votes do not matter, due to corruption and the limited power of elected representatives. The 2019 parliamentary elections saw record low turnout, and a pre-election survey by an Iranian state pollster estimated that turnout for the June 18 election might be as low as 40 percent. Previous presidential elections in Iran achieved over 50 percent turnout.Sure enough, on election day the predictions came true: Raisi handily won with nearly 62 percent of the vote, but turnout was a record low at only 48.8 percent. The news was greeted with condemnations from human rights groups like Amnesty International, which accused Raisi of involvement in ""crimes against humanity"" in the 1980s.On June 21, The Associated Press reported that Raisi said he'd refuse to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss a broad range of topics, from Iran's nuclear program to its sponsorship of militias in Iraq and Syria.";https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260831,https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/iran-elected-president-appointed-supreme-leader-charge,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57510763,https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/irans-presidential-election-what-know,https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran/freedom-world/2021,https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-presidential-election-boycott-poverty-corruption-repression/31268141.html,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-sole-moderate-presidential-candidate-congratulates-raisi-his-victory-state-2021-06-19/,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/amnesty-calls-investigation-into-irans-raisi-crimes-against-humanity-2021-06-19/,https://apnews.com/article/iran--president-elect-ebrahim-raisi-biden-63db1fbbdb1ff9fe40aca40f3f8046a2;Iran Touts ‘Sound’ Elections, But Rigged Is More Like It;;;;;;

REUTERS/Dondi TawataoThe ICC's authority to prosecute crimes against humanity generally applies to states that are party to the so-called Rome Statute, the treaty which established the ICC. Non-party states can also accept the ICC’s jurisdiction. If the United Nations Security Council refers a situation to the ICC, that also gives the ICC full power to investigate.If an individual is convicted, they will serve their sentence in one of the states that has agreed to enforce ICC prosecutions.The ICC has no police force or long-term detention facility, so they rely on cooperating countries to imprison people convicted by the court.The Philippine’s Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called on the government to “participate in this process of seeking truth and justice for the human rights violations committed in the country.”But a spokesperson for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the government would not cooperate with the investigation, noting the Philippines was no longer an ICC member.The spokesperson also rejected the results of Bensouda’s initial investigation.Others sought to discredit Bensouda. On June 17, Sen. Francis Tolentino, a Duterte ally, attacked Bensouda for “terrorist links.”“How can she, during her tenure, objectively conduct an investigation when some members of the international community considered her a persona non grata for terrorist links?” Tolentino said.“A lot of questions will have to be answered first whether a retired prosecutor can still recommend the prosecution of a head of state of a non-Treaty of Rome signatory.”The claim that Bensouda, whose term as prosecutor ended June 15, has terrorist links, is false.On June 11, 2020, then-U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13928, “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated With the International Criminal Court.”Bensouda and Phakiso Mochochoko, the Head of the Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division (Office of the Prosecutor) of the ICC, were added to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.However, they were not added to the list for terror-related offenses. Rather, the Trump administration was reacting to what it called the ICC’s “illegitimate assertions of jurisdiction over personnel of the United States and certain of its allies.”That, in part, stemmed from the ICC’s decision to “unanimously” authorize an investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by Afghan government national security forces and U.S. military and intelligence personnel, as well as the Taliban.Trump’s executive order said the decision to investigate could “subject current and former United States Government and allied officials to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest.”On April 1, 2021, newly-elected President Joe Biden revoked Trump’s order.A White House statement noted that while the U.S. maintains its objections to the ICC’s claims of jurisdiction over the United States and other non-signatory parties, “the threat and imposition of financial sanctions against the Court, its personnel, and those who assist it are not an effective or appropriate strategy for addressing the United States’ concerns with the ICC.”The Duterte government has also argued against the ICC’s jurisdiction.On June 15, the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) issued a statement on what it called Bensouda’s “deeply regrettable” decision to ask for an investigation into the drug-war killings. Calling the ICC “a court of last resort,” the DFA said that an Inter-Agency Review Panel headed by the Philippines’ Secretary of Justice was already investigating deaths in the drug war. It added that the panel “is continuing its work, and should be allowed to finish such work.”“The Rome Statute requires the Court and the Office of the Prosecutor to respect and defer to the primary criminal jurisdiction of concerned State Party, while proceedings are ongoing in the latter. The precipitate move of the Prosecutor is a blatant violation of the principle of complementarity, which is a bedrock principle of the Rome Statute,” the DFA said.The Philippines withdrew from the ICC in March 2019 after Bensouda announced a preliminary examination into alleged state crimes “in the context of the ‘war on drugs’ campaign.”Bensouda and others maintain that the ICC still has jurisdiction over the Philippines, as the alleged crimes occurred prior to Duterte’s decision to pull out.Figures put out by Philippines government agencies, rights organizations and media vary. However, a United Nations report estimated the drug war may have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths from 2016-2019.The Philippines police put that figure at 6,600.The U.N. report found that Duterte's public statements ""may have incited violence and may have had the effect of encouraging, backing or even ordering human rights violations, with impunity.""A crime against humanity carries a prison sentence not exceeding 30 years.";https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=210614-prosecutor-statement-philippines,https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf,https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/publications/uicceng.pdf,https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/791617/after-icc-prosecutor-seeks-probe-urges-gov-t-to-help-seek-truth-justice-for-rights-violations/story/,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-duterte-will-not-cooperate-with-icc-probe-2021-06-15/,https://www.facebook.com/PTVph/posts/4681329755260991?comment_id=4681363545257612,https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20200902,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/13928.pdf,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/01/executive-order-on-the-termination-of-emergency-with-respect-to-the-international-criminal-court/,https://dfa.gov.ph/dfa-news/statements-and-advisoriesupdate/29099-statement-on-the-request-of-the-office-of-the-icc-prosecutor-to-open-an-investigation-on-the-situation-in-the-philippines,https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=180208-otp-stat,https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/PH/Philippines-HRC44-AEV.pdf,https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/06/18/19/over-6000-killed-in-nearly-3-years-of-ph-drug-war-pnp;Duterte Ally Smears Criminal Court Prosecutor;;;;;;
185;;;;Unsubstantiated;Xinhua news agency;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-yuan-longping-great-famine/6742990.html;In Memory of ‘Father of Hybrid Rice,’ China Forgets Great Famine;2021-06-04;polygraph;;"On May 22, Yuan Longping, a renowned agronomist called the “father of hybrid rice” in China, died at the age of 90.Yuan, whose rice varieties helped revolutionize global agriculture in the 1970s, was recognized outside of China for his contributions in fighting world hunger.In 2004, he received the World Food Prize, an international award recognizing “the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world.”Following Yuan’s death, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua ran a profile commemorating his life’s work.Xinhua reported that in “over five decades in hybrid-rice research,” Yuan helped in “feeding nearly one-fifth of the world's population with less than nine percent of the world's total arable land.”His passing was met with “an outpouring of mourning, gratitude and remembrance” across China, the agency said.Xinhua claimed that Yuan, who was born in September 1930, had seen “with his own eyes"" that people were not getting enough to eat.”But then the report took a strange chronological turn.""I saw heartbreaking scenes of people starving to death on the road before 1949,"" Xinhua quoted Yuan as saying.The claim that Yuan spoke of witnessing those events before 1949 – prior to Chinese communist rule –is unsubstantiated. But there is clear evidence he made such remarks about The Great Famine, which killed tens of millions in Chinese communism’s early years.The famine lasted for some 5 years (1958-1962), which followed the Great Leap Forward, a Communist party campaign, aimed at overtaking UK in terms of annual steel output. In numerous interviews over the years, Yuan recounted seeing people starving to death on the road in 1960, a sight that he said inspired him to develop new strains of rice.The Xinhua article appears to be the first-ever mention of Yuan putting the starvation scene before 1949, the year communists gained control of mainland China, and leader Mao Zedong declared the People’s Republic of China.The Xinhua profile did not mention the Great Leap Forward or the Great Chinese Famine, which resulted in tens of millions of deaths. The famine has been called “the greatest manmade disaster in history.”A groundbreaking investigation of the event by former Xinhua journalist Yang Jisheng, titled ""Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine 1958-1962,"" found that institutional and ideological causes directly linked to Mao’s government were responsible for the mass deaths.Yang concluded that 36 million people died of starvation during the famine, in addition to a “shortfall of 40 million births.” Some scholars put the death toll at 45 million.Yang’s book was banned in China. Others say the toll was lower, but still large. In a 1989 study, Chinese researchers estimated 15 million died from malnutrition.To be sure, there is a possibility Yuan encountered death and starvation prior to 1949. Yuan lived through both through the Second-Sino Japanese War (1937-1945) and the Chinese Civil War (1927-1936 and 1945-1949).Both resulted in millions of deaths, atrocities, famine and starvation. For example, the Chinese Famine of 1942-43 is estimated to have killed 2 million to 3 million people in Henan province. In 1943, another 600,000 were estimated to have died of starvation in what is now Guandong province.The 1948 Siege of Changchun resulted in up to 150,000 civilian deaths by starvation.People wearing face masks walk past portraits of late Chinese Communist Party leaders (L-R) Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. This photo was taken on on May 7, 2020, in Beijing.Yet it’s indisputable that Yuan frequently cited the Great Famine as an impetus for developing better types of rice with higher yields. He repeatedly mentioned seeing people dying of hunger during the calamity.For example, in a 2007 report, now deleted from Xinhua, Yuan was quoted describing how he saw people starving to death on the road in 1960.That report was republished by China’s state-run CCTV and remains online. It reads:In 1960, natural and man-made disasters brought about a nationwide famine. Yuan Longping and his students also faced the threat of hunger. One day at noon, walking out of the school gate, he saw a group of people around the road from a distance. When he came near, there were two scrawny corpses lying on the side of the road, and the onlookers were all covered with sadness.Yuan Longping witnessed the harsh reality and felt the sting of the word ‘starvation.’ He deeply realized that ‘food is the most important thing for the people,’ and he felt that he should and must do something about it.A 2011 account by China Daily, an English-language daily newspaper owned by the CCP’s propaganda department, mirrors that account of events.In an April 8, 2009, report from Guangzhou Daily, Yuan not only attributed the Great Famine to the Great Leap Forward, but also noted seeing people die as a result.Yuan said:Tens of millions of people died of starvation during the three-year difficult period. The Great Leap Forward chopped down all the trees to make steel and destroyed the ecology. In 1959, there was a major draught and basically no harvest for that year. And 40 to 50 million people died of starvation. I saw five corpses of starvation lying beside a crop field, under a bridge and on the roadside. I saw it with my own eyes. It was very miserable.An item posted on the Chinese news portal Sina in 2014, headlined “Witnessing ‘Corpses of the Starved Everywhere’: Yuan Longping Determined to Make Hybrid Rice,” contained excerpts from a biography of Yuan. It included another account of Yuan seeing a crowd surrounding “two scrawny corpses” on the road in 1960.That report noted it was the third time Yuan had “seen ""corpses of starvation,"" having previously seen “two people fall from a bridge” and another person “fall by the side of the road” during the Great Famine.In an interview available on YouTube, Yuan described seeing “with his own eyes” five people who had succumbed to starvation “during the three-year hard period” — a euphemism for the Great Famine.On May 23, The Beijing News, a CCP-owned newspaper, also reported that Yuan had seen “five corpses of hunger lying down on the field ridge and the roadside” during “the three-year difficult period.”It said “the memory of hunger” from the famine was “rooted in his mind,” which served to inspire his future work. ""If the Chinese want to solve the problem of eating, the rice bowl must be in our own hands,” Yuan said.Radio Free Asia (RFA), the Voice of America’s sister organization, lists other media reports corroborating that account. They include a 2013 interview with People Magazine in which Yuan recited his experiences with starvation during the Great Famine.A man stands near a series of paper cuttings depicting Chinese President Xi Jinping next to former Chinese leader Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. This photo was taken on March 1, 2018, in Shanghai.Prior to the recent Xinhua article, there are no known accounts of Yuan claiming to have seen “people starving to death on the road before 1949.”Han Lianchao, a Visiting Fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute think tank, tweeted that his grandparents had died of starvation during the Great Famine “as described by Yuan Longping.”“They all starved to death when they were living a hard life (again, a euphemism for the Great Famine). The two uncles died by the crop field on their way home. Before 1949, they had dozens of acres of paddy fields and two tea farm hills. For generations, they were educated farmers, abundant, comfortable, and never starved,” he wrote.Polygraph.info reached out to Xinhua for clarification on the matter. Xinhua had not responded at the time of publication.According to RFA, a 2018 law in China criminalizes any attempts to smear “the reputation and honor of the ruling party’s canon of heroes and martyrs.”RFA said five people had been detained for posting derogatory comments about Yuan online following his death.Yuan’s accomplishments, as well as public displays to honor his passing, are real.Tens of thousands of people attended Yuan’s funeral to pay their respects.Scenes from the funeral procession show tearful mourners braving the rain to say their goodbyes.

A copy of the IAEA report obtained by Reuters revealed that Iran has failed to explain uranium traces at undeclared sites. “The lack of progress in clarifying the Agency's questions concerning the correctness and completeness of Iran's safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the Agency to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme,” the report said. According to CBS News, which also obtained a copy of the IAEA report, the agency said it hasn’t accessed key information on Iran’s program since February 23 and was concerned about its inability to verify what activities have been conducted at some sites. The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, said in a June 1 letter to the IAEA that his country has “[d]one its outmost efforts to cooperate with the agency substantively and provide the necessary clarifications and responses.” Parts of Salehi’s letter were tweeted by Iran’s envoy to the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog in Vienna, Kazem Gharibabadi. The letter conveyed Iran’s willingness to engage “in a proactive and focused effort to resolve the issues without any delay.” As U.N. reports show, the claim that Iran has done its “utmost” to cooperate is false.  Delegation members from the parties to the Iran nuclear deal – Germany, France, Britain, China, Russia and Iran – attend a meeting at the Grand Hotel of Vienna on May 1, 2021. In a May 26 interview with the Financial Times, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned that the level of uranium enrichment in Iran’s nuclear program approaches weapons-grade purity. “A country enriching at 60 per cent is a very serious thing — only countries making bombs are reaching this level. Sixty per cent is almost weapons grade, commercial enrichment is 2, 3 [per cent],” Grossi told the Times. (Enrichment is the process of enhancing natural uranium ore so that it can sustain a nuclear reaction to fuel power plants or make atomic bombs.) Iran insists that its nuclear program is for medical purposes and research, not weapons. The IAEA’s findings came as signatories of the 2015 accord to regulate Iran’s nuclear program participate in a fifth round of talks to revive the pact after the U.S. unilaterally pulled out three years later under then-President Donald Trump. The United States, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia agreed to the original deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). After withdrawing, the Trump administration imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, which scaled back cooperation in 2019. Iran has tied its willingness to negotiate to the removal of U.S. sanctions. The IAEA has repeatedly voiced its concerns about undeclared Iranian nuclear activities. In its February report, the IAEA stressed that Iran had not answered its questions.   In December 2020, The Associated Press said it had obtained satellite images showing the beginning of construction on a site at Iran’s Fardo underground nuclear facility. Iran did not provide any public acknowledgement or explain the purpose of the construction. On February 23, Iran suspended working under a protocol that allows inspectors access to information about its nuclear program so they can look for malign intent. However, on May 24, Iran decided to extend its cooperation for an additional month. The Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organization that promotes arms control, said that Iran’s decision to halt and resume cooperation is an attempt to narrow the window for the U.S. to revive the nuclear deal. Laurence Norman, who writes for The Wall Street Journal from Brussels, tweeted on May 31 that Iran appears to be buying time in the run-up to its presidential elections this month. Elliott Abrams, for a time the Trump administration’s special representative on Iran, cited media reports about Iran’s clandestine efforts to hide its program in a blog post for the Council on Foreign Relations. According to Abrams, Iran has been actively trying to conceal its nuclear program and has even sought elements to extend its nuclear arsenal, in contrast to countries like Libya and South Africa, which sought international assistance to get rid of their nuclear weapons programs.The National, a private English-language newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates, reported on May 4 that Dutch intelligence revealed findings on Iran’s quest in Europe for technology to develop weapons of mass destruction. The newspaper said similar reports came from Germany and Sweden. Turkish public broadcaster TRT tweeted on May 23 that Iran has blocked the IAEA from viewing satellite imagery of all its nuclear sites.   Western diplomats say reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran remains crucial, so that international inspectors can access Iran’s facilities.

They called for his impeachment, acceleration of vaccinations and more emergency aid. The following day, Bolsonaro posted a video on Twitter about the latest actions by the Ministry of Health related to vaccination. “96.5 million [doses] delivered. 65.2 million [doses] applied,” the video shows, later stating that an extra “2.3 million [doses] of Pfizer” would arrive at “the beginning of June” in “all municipalities.” Bolsonaro claimed Brazil had the fourth-highest number of vaccinations in the world, only “behind nations that have API to produce the immunizer.” (API, or active pharmaceutical ingredient, is the biologically active component of a drug product, this case a COVID-19 vaccine.) The tweet and the video, however, give a misleading view of the government's efforts in fighting the pandemic, which have been tainted by mismanagement, negligence, delayed vaccines and unproven COVID-19 treatments. The troubled response has triggered a Brazilian Senate investigation into the administration’s actions. What follows is some of the context Bolsonaro overlooked.  A container with 1,000,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine arrives at the Viracopos International Airport in Campinas, on April 29, 2021. Pfizer vaccine Brazil received its first shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses in late April. However, those could have come as early as December 2020. Last August, Pfizer offered the Brazilian government 70 million doses, but the health ministry, then led by Eduardo Pazuello, was not interested in the deal, calling it “abusive.” Pfizer said its terms were the same as those offered to other countries, CNN Brasil reported. In December, Bolsonaro told Brazilians that if the Pfizer vaccine turned them into “alligators"" it was “their problem.” In May, Pfizer's chief executive for Latin America, Carlos Murillo, confirmed to lawmakers during the pandemic probe that Pfizer repeatedly offered vaccines to Brazil between August and November 2020. Murillo “said that on Sept. 12 the company's CEO sent a letter to Bolsonaro and others in his cabinet, including then-health minister Eduardo Pazuello, expressing interest in providing Brazil with vaccines,” and that “[t]he letter went unanswered for two months,” Reuters reported. Sources told Reuters that Pazuello did not take Pfizer’s offer because “he believed Brazil should rely on British and Chinese vaccines produced in the country.” As Polygraph has reported, Bolsonaro said last October that “he wouldn’t buy vaccines from China, even though the health ministry announced the purchase of 46 million doses of China's CoronaVac, and Sao Paulo's Instituto Butantan, one of the world’s leading scientific centers, had received doses of CoronaVac. Bolsonaro reversed himself a month later, saying Brazil would purchase CoronaVac.” On May 26, Brazil’s Ministry of Health announced that the Pfizer vaccine could be sent to cities beyond state capitals, where they initially were used, given the special storage and transportation needs. The ministry noted, however, that each state should designate which municipalities should receive the doses. This meant that not all municipalities would receive the Pfizer vaccine, contradicting Bolsonaro’s video portrayal.

Vaccination ranking  Bolsonaro was correct to say that Brazil had administered the fourth-highest number of vaccine doses – behind China, the United States and India. But this does not mean Brazil is vaccinating more of its population than most countries. It is important to recall that all four nations are among the most populous, and so administering more vaccines is expected, and not necessarily a measure of success. Brazil's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, which started only on January 18, has been much slower than in many other countries. Critics blame Bolsonaro and his administration for consistently downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and working against locally imposed lockdowns and other containment methods. When it comes to doses per capita, Brazil is administering 32 doses per 100 people, behind 55 countries, according to The New York Times vaccination tracker, which uses data from Our World in Data. The United Arab Emirates, which is in first place, administers 133 doses per 100 people, followed by Israel, administering 117 doses per 100 people. Moreover, the total number of doses administered is not equal to the number of people vaccinated – considering that most vaccines require two doses. In fact, Brazil has given at least one shot of the vaccine to 22 percent of the population, and fully vaccinated only half of that – 11 percent. The United States, in comparison, has given at least one shot to 51 percent of its population and fully vaccinated 41 percent.  Gravediggers at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, on January 17, 2021. Brazil’s coronavirus outbreak has exploded since its first case was confirmed in late February 2020, and Bolsonaro has persistently minimized the dangers of COVID-19. Last year, he said it was “a little cold” and called alarm over the pandemic “hysterical.” He also undermined and tried to overrule isolation orders imposed by state governors and even personally attended anti-lockdown protests. Bolsonaro embraced the use of hydroxychloroquine for ""early treatment” – going as far as to take it after he contracted COVID-19 in July 2020 – and also boosted ivermectin (an anti-parasite medication). Since the beginning of the pandemic, two Brazilian health ministers left their posts amid disagreements with the president about isolation measures and the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment. His third health minister, an army general who specializes in logistics and has no experience in health care, left his post in March amid investigations into his handling of the health care in Manaus. The health ministry is now being led by a fourth minister, Marcelo Queiroga. On April 27, the Brazilian Senate started investigating the Bolsonaro government’s actions and omissions throughout the pandemic. The probe is expected to last 90 days but could be extended. Civil or criminal actions might be proposed, which could lead the way for an impeachment if the president of the House (Camara dos Deputados) allows for a vote on the matter. Polygraph has previously reported on the pandemic situation in Brazil, including the shortage and near collapse of the health care system in the state of Amazonas, and the administration’s misleading statements about vaccination, mask use, transmission, and the government’s actions.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/tens-of-thousands-of-brazilians-march-to-demand-bolsonaros-impeachment,https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1398970602439032832,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140605093305.htm,https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/03/27/brazils-mismanagement-of-covid-19-threatens-the-world,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/27/895940087/brazils-bolsonaro-is-accused-of-crime-against-humanity-over-coronavirus-neglect,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/americas/brazil-hydroxychloroquine-evidence-intl/index.html ,https://www.dw.com/pt-br/senado-instala-cpi-da-pandemia-e-inicia-investiga%C3%A7%C3%A3o-sobre-governo-bolsonaro/a-57351689,https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-56930584,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/saude/2021/01/08/pfizer-diz-que-ofereceu-proposta-para-brasil-comprar-vacinas-em-agosto,https://istoe.com.br/bolsonaro-sobre-vacina-de-pfizer-se-voce-virar-um-jacare-e-problema-de-voce/,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-got-no-response-offers-supply-vaccine-brazil-last-year-exec-says-2021-05-13/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-in-brazil-an-outgoing-health-ministers-alternate-covid19-reality/31165631.html,https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/vacina-da-pfizer-estados-ja-podem-expandir-a-vacinacao-para-municipios,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil/brazil-vaccinations-start-as-country-faces-vaccine-ingredient-shortfall-idUSKBN29N11D,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52638352,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbBvuXlNWjE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbBvuXlNWjE,https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3082699/coronavirus-brazils-bolsonaro-eggs-huge-crowd-lockdown,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/world/americas/virus-brazil-bolsonaro-chloroquine.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil/brazils-bolsonaro-tests-positive-for-the-novel-coronavirus-again-idUSKCN24N1P9,https://brazilian.report/liveblog/coronavirus/2021/01/05/bolsonaro-touts-alleged-efficacy-of-ivermectin-against-covid-19/,https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/A-Paratrooper-General-Is-Brazils-New-Health-Minister-20200516-0004.html,https://www.dw.com/pt-br/stf-autoriza-investigação-de-pazuello-por-colapso-em-manaus/a-56345062,https://www.dw.com/pt-br/senado-instala-cpi-da-pandemia-e-inicia-investiga%C3%A7%C3%A3o-sobre-governo-bolsonaro/a-57351689,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/04/entenda-como-a-cpi-da-covid-pode-contribuir-para-responsabilizar-bolsonaro-por-falas-e-postura-na-pandemia.shtml,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-latin-america-covid19-cases/30678417.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-brazilian-leaders-deflect-blame-as-coronavirus-overruns-hospitals-in-brazil-manaus/31060264.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-in-brazil-an-outgoing-health-ministers-alternate-covid19-reality/31165631.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-jair-bolsonaro-misrepresents-german-report-on-kids-masks/31129988.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/bolsonaro-top-health-official-flubs-a-key-virus-fact/30751052.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/bolsonaro-son-counters-coronavirus/30714771.html;Amid Impeachment Furor, Bolsonaro Misleads With Boasts of Vaccine 'Success';;;;;;
188;;;;False;Viktor Zuev;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-covid-origin/6742985.html;Russia’s Top Virologist Takes China’s Side Against Lab Leak Theory;2021-06-02;polygraph;;"Russia’s top virologist, Viktor Zuev, has backed China’s denial of allegations that the virus that causes COVID-19 may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan.Similar viruses originating in bats have been collected and studied by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In recent weeks, western intelligence agencies have reportedly shown renewed interest in the theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have escaped from a lab.“You have to work hard to make an artificial virus. All this talk comes from doing nothing. The virus came from animals and there is nothing here to make a fuss about,” Zuev told Echo Moskvy, Russia’s most popular radio station, on May 30.Claims that the lab-origin theory is groundless are false. In fact, the jury is still out.According Echo Moskvy’s website, Zuev was responding to new reports that U.K. intelligence believes it’s “feasible” the virus “escaped” from the bio lab. The Sunday Times reported on May 30 that U.K. intelligence is pursuing this idea. The newspaper, citing anonymous sources, provided little to explain what brought British intelligence to that view. The Times said intel officials are enlisting dark net sources in China in the search for evidence.The COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 3.5 million people worldwide. As countries roll out vaccines, questions about the origin of SARS-Cov-2 remain unsettled and politically sensitive.The idea that the virus leaked from the highly regarded Wuhan bio lab initially was rejected by some virologists who said it was more normal for such a virus to jump from animal hosts to humans.More recently, as more mutations of the virus were detected and came under study, skeptics began raising fresh questions. Alina Chan, a genetic engineer and postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was among the first to challenge the natural mutation theory in the early days of the pandemic.Chan did not claim that a lab leak was the only answer. Yet, the Wuhan Institute of Virology is the only bio lab known to possess a virus with the closest genetic code to SARS-Cov-2. It could have been accidentally released, Chan told Slate in May.Some purveyors of the lab-leak theory speculate that an original virus collected from Chinese bats could have been altered in the laboratory so that it would infect humans. China has declined to provide international bodies like the World Health Organization complete access to data or other resources about the initial outbreak of the virus in late 2019, seeding mistrust and the origins guessing game.In a report published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists on May 5, former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade explored the two main origin theories. While not dismissing natural emergence, he argued that the weight of evidence backed a lab escape.According to Wade, initial rejection of the lab-origin theory was fueled in part by a February 19, 2020, letter in the British medical journal Lancet. The letter was “organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak’s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Wade wrote, alleging that a conflict of interest was not disclosed. (On Twitter, Daszak called Wade's story ""error-filled"" and ""misleading."")In late May, the U.S. intelligence community said both the natural emergence and the lab-leak theories were plausible but each lacked convincing evidence, Reuters and other news sites reported.President Joe Biden has ordered a 90-day investigation to find answers and make them public.On May 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that several employees at the Wuhan virology lab fell ill in November 2019, just prior to the official Chinese timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Journal, citing ""previously undisclosed"" U.S. intelligence, said the lab workers were hospitalized with symptoms like those caused by the coronavirus.China termed the Journal report “completely untrue.”Beijing rejects the lab-leak theory and has tried to shift blame on the United States with misleading or false claims about the U.S. bio lab at Fort Detrick in Maryland.Among Russian virologists, opinions about the origins of SARS-Cov-2 vary widely. Some firmly support China’s position and have said the lab leak is impossible. But Petr Chumakov, chief researcher at the Moscow Engelhart Institute of Molecular Biology, told Russian media in April that a Wuhan lab leak is “exceedingly” the most logical explanation.Chumakov said genetic experiments in the Wuhan lab were aimed at understanding the disease-causing attributes of the virus – that is, its pathogenicity.“They did absolutely crazy things, in my opinion,” he said, as quoted in The Sun newspaper. “For example, inserts in the genome, which gave the virus the ability to infect human cells. Now all this has been analyzed. The picture of the possible creation of the current coronavirus is slowly emerging.”Chumakov noted that results of the Wuhan lab experiments were published in the open scientific press. ""It’s too early to blame anyone,” The Sun quoted him as saying.Zuev, who is vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a chief researcher at the Moscow Gamalea Institute that created the Sputnik V vaccine, has not always rejected the possibility of a lab leak and a genetically altered virus.In March, he told the Pravda newspaper that “the wildlife is stuffed with viruses,” which “transform every second without any human intervention.” Zuev was commenting on the results of a public opinion survey that showed 64 percent of participants in Russia believed the coronavirus was specifically designed as a bioweapon.However, in a January 2020 interview, Zuev said he did not reject the theory that the virus may have been ""artificially created.""";https://echo.msk.ru/news/2846334-echo.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/china-uk-spies-say-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-wuhan-lab-is-plausible-2021-5?op=1,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/covid-wuhan-lab-leak-is-feasible-say-british-spies-cvtxjjwpc,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/how-media-shifted-on-covid-lab-leak-theory-after-months-of-dismissing-it/ar-AAKoOp9,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21156607/how-did-the-coronavirus-get-started-china-wuhan-lab,https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/covid-lab-leak-theory-pandemic-research.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-covid-timeline/30542129.html,https://www.who.int/news/item/30-03-2021-who-calls-for-further-studies-data-on-origin-of-sars-cov-2-virus-reiterates-that-all-hypotheses-remain-open,https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930418-9/fulltext,https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/,https://usrtk.org/biohazards-blog/ecohealth-alliance-orchestrated-key-scientists-statement-on-natural-origin-of-sars-cov-2/,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-intelligence-community-acknowledges-two-theories-covid-19-origin-2021-05-27/,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/us/politics/coronavirus-origins-intelligence.html,https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-on-sick-staff-at-wuhan-lab-fuels-debate-on-covid-19-origin-11621796228,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/china-rejects-report-of-sick-staff-at-wuhan-lab-prior-to-covid-outbreak,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-who-covid-lab/31188210.html,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11462934/coronavirus-wuhan-lab-russia-microbiologist-claims/,https://www.pravda.ru/health/1596535-zuev/,https://snob.ru/profile/30401/blog/164339/;Russia’s Top Virologist Takes China’s Side Against Lab Leak Theory;;;;;;
189;;;;True;Thai prime minister’s office;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-thailand-no-coronavirus-variant/6742984.html;A ‘Thai Variant’ for Coronavirus? Not Really. It's Complicated.;2021-06-02;polygraph;;"Recent media reports in the United Kingdom have noted the emergence of a “Thai variant” of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Those reports were based on a May 27 report by Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency sponsored by the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care.The PHE report notes that C.36.3 — the SARS-CoV-2 mutation at issue — was designated a Variant Under Investigation on May 24 “on the basis of the mutation profile and increased importation from a widening international area.”Approximately 109 cases had been detected in the U.K. at the time of the report’s publication.Trouble is, the variant didn’t originate in Thailand, as some news reports suggested. That’s why the Thai prime minister’s P.R. office took to Twitter.“The Director-General of the Department of Medical Sciences clarified that there has been some misleading information in the media on the Thai #COVID19 variant found in the UK,” it tweeted.The department continued:""According to the report from the Public Health England, the C.36.3 variant was detected in Thailand. Nonetheless, Thailand's Ministry of Public Health made it clear that the variant had actually been found in a person who traveled from Egypt while staying in the state quarantine.""That statement is true.The director of Thailand’s Disease Control Department, Dr. Opart Karnkawinpong, explained the first known host of the C.36.3 variant was an Egyptian man who had traveled to Hong Kong and then Bangkok on January 25, according to Thai PBS, a public broadcasting service in Thailand.After testing positive for COVID-19, the man was hospitalized on January 29. Karnkawinpong said that no one in Thailand was reported to have been infected with the C.36.3 variant, and it should therefore be viewed as “imported.”That view is consistent with the British PHE report, which noted that the C.36.3 variant was “first detected in sequence from Thailand ex Egypt.”Health workers collect nasal swabs from men for coronavirus testing in Bangkok on Tuesday, June 1, 2021. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)What’s it all mean? Media reports labeling the variant solely as “Thai” were misleading. And the confusion underscores the dangers of labeling virus variants by geography, something the World Health Organization and experts want to correct.It should be noted that some British media reports did state that the variant “was first detected in Thailand in people who had travelled from Egypt,” as reported by Yahoo News UK, The Mirror, The Independent and others. Yet, some, like The Independent, went for a clickbait headline, labeling the newly detected mutation a “Thai variant.”The Independent further used misleading language, saying the ""new mutant strain … first emerged in Thailand."" ""Emerged"" implies place of origin, and that is unproved.Researchers in the U.K. have developed a so-called Pango Network, which names versions of SARS-CoV-2 (such as B.1.1.7 and P.1).However, that naming system has not been universally adopted. Thai media also have regularly referred to other variants of SARS-CoV-2 by their perceived geographical origins.Katie Baca, a historian of science and medicine at Harvard University, and Susana Bejar, an internal medicine physician in New York City, have warned against ""naming pathogens or diseases as if they have nationalities.”For example, B.1.1.7, is commonly referred to as the “U.K. variant” of SARS-CoV-2. The strain was reported as a “variant of concern” on December 14, 2020.But Baca and Bejar say that just because the U.K. first detected the B.1.1.7 variant, that “doesn’t mean the variant originated there.” They cite a BBC report that B.1.1.7 may have first been detected in the U.K. thanks to the country’s robust genomic surveillance system.Other SARS-CoV-2 strains widely referred to by their supposed place of origin include the B.1.617 strain, first detected in India, and the B.1.351 variant, first detected in South Africa. A variant recently discovered in Vietnam that is believed to be a hybrid of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617 strains is not being referred to as the Vietnam variant. Some Thai public health officials say the naming conventions around another variant — P.1 — are analogous to those of C.36.3.P.1 was first detected in four travelers from Brazil tested at Haneda Airport outside Tokyo, Japan, in January.Staffs wearing protective masks to help curb the spread of the coronavirus walk in the empty ticketing area at Narita International Airport in Narita, Japan, on Tuesday, June 1, 2021.“If the origin [of C.36.3] is from Egypt then it should not be called a Thai variant,” the Thai Enquirer, an English language news website, quoted Supakit Sirilak, Chief of Thailand’s Department of Medical Sciences, as saying. “This is similar to Japan when they found the Brazilian variant. They reported it as the Brazilian strain. Therefore this should be called the Egyptian variant.”The Thai government has been blamed for a failed vaccine rollout and “broken pandemic response” amid a recent surge in COVID-19 infections. But the country is not alone in trying to avoid being cast as a virus originator.India's information technology (IT) ministry has also asked social media firms to scrub all references to an “Indian variant” of SARS-CoV-2 from their platforms.“This is completely FALSE. There is no such variant of Covid-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has not associated the term 'Indian Variant' with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,” Reuters quoted the ministry as stating in a letter to social media firms.Virus-blaming is setting off international alarms. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health cited a warning from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who cautioned that “the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering.”According to the study, the WHO has recommended “avoiding terms that connect diseases to countries or specific people … to mitigate this discrimination.”In earlier guidelines, the WHO said disease names should “consist of generic descriptive terms” related to symptoms,” as well as “who it affects, its severity or seasonality” and the pathogen which causes the disease, if known. The WHO said disease names should not include geographic locations, including cities, countries, regions, continents; people’s names; species/class of animal or food; cultural, population, industry or occupational references; or terms that incite undue fear.On May 31, the WHO announced what it called “simple, easy-to-say and remember” labels for SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern.Those labels will employ letters from the Greek alphabet.";https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990339/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_13_England.pdf,https://www.thaipbsworld.com/thai-govt-claims-c-36-3-strain-of-covid-19-is-not-a-thai-variant-and-not-of-concern/,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-new-thai-variant-investigated-more-than-100-cases-085512118.html,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/major-covid-variants-detected-uk-24203936,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/coronavirus-news-live-active-cases-b1855526.html?page=2,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1442280/thai-covid-variant-uk-public-health-england-update-breaking-news,https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/sars-cov-2-naming-system-pango-network/,https://www.pango.network/,https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/40001283,https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2121535/hunt-on-for-sa-variant-across-south,https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/09/not-british-variant-call-it-b117/,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666,https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-india-coronavirus-pandemic-health-c4c0a7c9f2e3b03c9cea2bf6fdcad70d,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/11/national/science-health/new-coronavirus-variant-japan/,https://www.thaienquirer.com/28006/thai-government-says-dont-call-it-the-thai-variant/,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/thailand-virus-infections-hit-record-vaccine-rollout-stutters,https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-covid-vaccination/a-57599302,https://coconuts.co/bangkok/features/its-not-too-late-to-fix-thailands-broken-pandemic-response-opinion/,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/,https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306154,https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf,https://www.who.int/news/item/31-05-2021-who-announces-simple-easy-to-say-labels-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-interest-and-concern;A ‘Thai Variant’ for Coronavirus?

Vishnu Vardhan Reddy;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-indian-politician-gloats-vaccine-efforts-as-covid19-rages-in-the-country/6742968.html;Indian Politician Brags About Vaccine Efforts as COVID-19 Rages;2021-05-21;polygraph;;"On May 17, as India continued to be crushed by the coronavirus pandemic, S. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary for the state of Andhra Pradesh, tweeted praise for the authorities' vaccination campaign.“Till date we have vaccinated 18cr+ [180 million+] Indians. Free vaccines for 45+ age group. Free ration to 80cr+ people for months,” he wrote, adding that “this was possible just because of our PM Shri,” meaning Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Reddy’s tweet is misleading: 180 million+ is an estimate of the number of doses that have been administered in India so far, not the number of people vaccinated.According to Our World in Data, as of May 18, 144.1 million people had received at least one shot of the vaccine. Out of the 144.1 million, 40.9 million – only about 3 percent of India’s population – had received both shots.So, while 185 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered, fewer people have been vaccinated than Reddy claimed.India is a leading maker of vaccines, and joined the World Health Organization’s COVAX program in partnership with other U.N. bodies and Gavi, an alliance to help get COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. In early March, it donated 150,000 doses to Iran through the program. But simultaneously, the country has failed to control the coronavirus pandemic, largely because of domestic vaccine shortages. “Even if the projected supply was available, India has opened the vaccination to a far bigger population than probably any setting can expect the vaccines [to cover],” Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, a New Delhi doctor and expert on vaccines, public policy and health systems, told CNBC. “It is essentially an outcome of limited supply and a vaccination policy which is not mindful of supplies.” People waiting to receive a dose of Covishield at a vaccination center in New Delhi, on May 4, 2021. As the Quartz business website reported, “tracking events over the past year reveals a timeline of dysfunction: a period in which government negligence, corporate profiteering, opaque contracting, and the inequities of the global pharma market combined to bring India to this moment of vaccine crisis.” In January, Indian regulators approved the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines for use. India then placed its first vaccine orders, for 11 million doses of Covishield and 5.5 million doses of Covaxin – an extremely small number considering the country’s population. KV Balasubramaniam, who formerly headed Indian Immunologicals, a vaccine manufacturer, estimated that “to achieve herd immunity in a year, taking into account a 5% wastage margin, India needs about 200 million doses per month,” as Quartz wrote. In February, the government ordered another 10 million doses of Covishield and 4.5 million doses of Covaxin. Meanwhile, India was exporting tens of millions of doses to countries in Africa and Latin America, as well as Caribbean Middle East and Pacific Island states.In late March, India temporarily halted its participation in the COVAX program in order to address a domestic shortage of vaccines amid a surge of new COVID-19 infections. Also in March, the government made its first big order – for 100 million Covishield doses and 20 million Covaxin doses. However, by that time, India was already facing the start of a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases rising extremely fast and devastating the nation. In early April, India was seeing more than 150,000 new cases daily. By May, the number reached 400,000 – compared to less than 20,000 in January and February.The sharp increase was due to ""a false sense of normalcy [which] crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave,” Dr. A Fathahudeen, a member of India’s Kerala state's Covid taskforce, told BBC News. Most public places reopened, transportation resumed operating at full capacity, and religious ceremonies and festivals, as well as election rallies, took place.On May 20, India set a world record for COVID-19 deaths, recording more than 4,500 deaths in a single day. However, experts say that number is a small fraction of the coronavirus toll in the country, given gross undercounting.  A mass cremation of COVID-19 victims is seen at a crematorium parking lot in New Delhi, on April 22, 2021.

That meeting took place in Iceland on May 19 on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit.Both sides assessed the meeting as positive and constructive, and Russian state media’s coverage of the meeting has been unusually neutral for a U.S.-related topic.However, for the domestic Russian-speaking audience, the state media coverage missed some details, such as the fact that Blinken spoke about the fate of Alexey Navalny, the imprisoned opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and about Russian government pressure against U.S.-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).Yet, despite the overall measured tone, Russian state television delivered blow after blow against the U.S. in its coverage of the Blinken-Lavrov meeting, particularly against U.S. President Joe Biden.Yevgeny Popov, who co-hosts 60 Minutes, which claims nearly 400 million viewers on YouTube alone, began the May 20 edition with an apparent attack on Biden, saying:“In Reykjavik, for the first time after Joe Biden's seizure of the White House, an official face-to-face contact between the Russian Federation and the United States took place.”The claim that Biden “seized” the White House is false.Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election with an overwhelming majority of Electoral College votes and a comfortable majority of the popular vote.While the previous administration disputed Biden’s victory, including in courts, the legal challenges have been rejected as having no merit.Furthermore, the Russian word “zakhvat” that Popov used in describing President Biden’s accession to the White House means a seizure of power by force.After the Biden tirade, Popov continued, claiming that Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov “remembers Blinken as a boy who used to carry papers for [former U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry,” and thus, has offered Blinken “a helping hand in clearing out the debris” of the bilateral relationship Blinken, according to Popov, rejected the offer.Olga Skabeyeva and Yevgeny Popov, Hosts of 60 Minutes, Russian State TV program.Yevgeny Popov, with his wife and 60 Minutes co-host Olga Skabeyeva, are among Russia’s most influential political journalists.

One video that circulated widely showed people dancing on the square outside the Id Kah mosque in Xinjiang’s city of Kashgar.Li Jingjing, a journalist with China’s state-run CGTN who describes herself as “a Chinese and a lie-debunker!,” tweeted:""#RealXinjiang People in Kashgar, Xinjiang celebrating Eid al-Fitr today. Eid Mubarak! #UyghurHowever, the Chinese authorities’ campaign to use state-managed activities as a way to demonstrate the “real” situation in Xinjiang is misleading.First, as noted in the Global Times report, the diplomats only “observed” the event via video link, and not in person.That, along with the claim that “Xinjiang has nothing to hide,” comes as Western states and human rights groups have petitioned Beijing to allow the United Nations High Commissioner unfettered access to investigate the plight of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in the region.Many say China’s actions against the Uyghurs amounts to genocide, a charge Beijing categorically rejects.One day prior to the Eid social media blitz, May 12, the U.S. State Department released its 2020 International Religious Freedom Report, which stated: “China broadly criminalizes religious expression and continues to commit crimes against humanity and genocide against Muslim Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.”The Global Times called the U.S. report a “smear,” saying its claims “contrasted [with] the live videos and pictures showing local residents dancing happily to celebrate Eid-al-Fitr.”However, there is evidence that participation in the Eid state-sponsored festivities was at least partly coerced.Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC) rights group, told Radio Free Asia (RFA)’s Uyghur service that China had designed and used the event to spread “disinformation” and to counter allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.Dolkun Isa, president of World Uyghur Congress, speaks during a press conference at the Foreign Press Club of Japan in Tokyo, Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)“One shining example is that on the first day of Eid, China forced Uyghurs to go to mosques to attend a Chinese flag-raising ceremony, sing the Chinese national anthem, and then pray and dance in order to create a facade that suggests Uyghurs enjoy religious freedom,” Isa said.He added: “Until China officially closes the concentration camps, releases the Uyghur detainees, apologizes for its policy of genocide, pays reparations to the Uyghurs and other indigenous Turkic peoples, and allows an unfettered international investigation [of the situation in the XUAR], no one will accept its staged performances of Uyghur happiness and freedom.”Isa also noted that while restrictions on fasting had been eased during Ramadan, many residents had opted not to fast for fear of being labeled extremists.In 2019, a Chinese diplomat confirmed to the Voice of America (VOA) that restrictions on fasting during Ramadan had been placed on some people in Xinjiang, including government officials and “students with compulsory education and hard learning tasks.”It is unknown whether those locked up in China’s sweeping network of “reeducation camps” fall under the category of “students.”CGTN journalist Li Jingjing called the RFA report “desperate crap,” claiming “[t]hey don't know how to deal with the happiness of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.”But Simon Leplatre, a correspondent for France’s Le Monde newspaper who was on the ground in Xinjiang for the festivities, posted video documentation and witness testimony showing the event appeared at least partially choreographed.One day before Eid al-Fitr, Leplatre visited Id Kah mosque and saw people practicing the dance before the fasting period had broken.When Leplatre asked a man what was happening, the man replied that he had no idea and added that ""the lingdao (boss) made us come.”Leplatre also posted footage showing “older guys” clearly directing the dancers on how to move.The Global Times charged that Leplatre, by suggesting that Chinese authorities were “‘forcing' Uyghurs to ‘dance’,” was spreading rumors, provoking Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian and others, and “demonizing Xinjiang.”Leplatre showed the video to Uyghur language activist Abduweli Ayup, who had lived in Kashgar until 2015.Ayup said that the Chinese government has asked people to dance for Eid, tweeting:“Yes we dance Sama in front of the mosque every Eid, but we never rehears[e] it one day earlier, we don't dance that way, because we all know how to dance. This style is just for the show, not natural.”In a separate tweet, Ayup noted that the Eid prayer at the biggest mosque in Urumchi started with China’s national anthem.“We have never heard the anthem at the mosque, never seen Chinese lantern in front of us during the prayer till 2016,” Ayup wrote. “There's no teenagers, young Uyghurs, no one has beard, source said people forced to go.”Previous reports have documented a prohibition on young men in Xinjiang growing beards or studying Islam. Nathan Ruser, a researcher with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which has documented abuses in Xinjiang, tweeted that while Uyghurs were filmed dancing, they had not been allowed to pray during Eid al-Fitr for the last six years.He also said that celebratory house visits had been banned.The Associated Press (AP) reported on May 13: “Muslim leaders from the Xinjiang region rejected Western allegations that China is suppressing religious freedom.”Abdureqip Tomurniyaz, who heads the association and the school for Islamic studies in Xinjiang, told AP that anti-China forces in the U.S. and other Western nations were spreading rumors and lies about the situation there.“They want to sabotage Xinjiang’s harmony and stability, contain China’s rise and alienate relations between China and Islamic countries,” he said.Officials accompany foreign journalists during a visit to the Xinjiang Islamic Institute in Urumqi on April 22, 2021. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)According to AP, a report by the U.S.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project “documented at least 630 religious figures who have been detained or imprisoned in Xinjiang, most since 2014.”Meantime, the apparent campaign to share the dance video appears to be the latest manifestation of China’s so-called wolf-warrior diplomacy, which, according to the International Federation of Journalists, employs Chinese embassies and ambassadors to “frequently comment on local media coverage of China.”A recent investigation by AP and the Oxford Internet Institute found that China has also used “an army of fake Twitter accounts” to amplify these commentaries.While the debate over allegations of genocide, mass incarceration and forced labor continues, there is ample additional evidence that Muslims in China are the targets of discrimination.That evidence includes a “mosque rectification” program that has reportedly seen thousands of religious buildings and sites damaged or destroyed in recent years, along with campaigns to force Uyghurs to abandon cultural and religious practices.";https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1223450.shtml,https://www.youtube.com/c/JingjingLi_China/videos,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/calls-grow-un-china-admit-rights-chief-xinjiang,https://www.cfr.org/article/chinas-abuse-uighurs-does-genocide-label-fit,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-parliament-declares-genocide-chinas-xinjiang-raises-pressure-johnson-2021-04-22/,https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-on-release-of-the-2020-international-religious-freedom-report/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/whitewash-05132021195709.html,https://www.voanews.com/extremism-watch/diplomat-confirms-limits-ramadan-xinjiang,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/details-leak-chinas-mass-detention-camps-xinjiang-us-official-blasts,https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2021-05-19/doc-ikmxzfmm3246841.shtml,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sama_(Sufism),https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-48696184,https://www.startribune.com/ramadan-in-china-faithful-dwindle-under-limits-on-religion/600054080/,https://apnews.com/article/china-government-and-politics-religion-3d8fa6aee61268d105610ebc92ed1b55,https://www.ifj.org/fileadmin/user_upload/IFJ_-_The_Covid_Story_Report.pdf,https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-china-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-62b13895aa6665ae4d887dcc8d196dfc,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/19/china-crimes-against-humanity-xinjiang,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-xinjiang-religious-freedom/31004192.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mosque-destruction-xinjiang-china/31238038.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/furniture-01092020165529.html;China’s ‘Wolf Warriors’ Spread Staged Eid al-Fitr Dance Video;;;;;;

After 2005, Iran sought to upgrade some of the Simorghs to the two-seat F-5B variant, by cannibalizing parts from other aircraft and rebuilding the cockpit section to accommodate the second seat.Thus, Press TV’s description of the Simorgh as being “domestically-manufactured” is misleading. It is also unclear what kind of “test flights” the fighter jet in the video was performing, given that such aircraft have long been in Iran’s inventory, or exactly when this footage was recorded. This is not even the first time Iran has promoted a modified F-5 as a “domestically produced” fighter. In 2004 another variant with two tails, as opposed to the usual one, was put on display.While the Simorgh is simply a converted U.S. Cold-War-era F-5, at least it flies, which is more than can be said for the F313 Qaher, which Iran promoted in videos as a domestically-produced “stealth fighter.” Videos appeared in 2017 showing the F313 taxiing around a tarmac, but eagle-eyed observers determined it was a non-flying mock-up.The Iranian regime, and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have repeatedly spread disinformation claiming possession of new, domestically-produced weapons systems. In 2008, the IRGC released a doctored photo of missile launches, and in 2012 Iranian state media passed off pictures of a Japanese drone as an Iranian-produced one.;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/simorgh.htm,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-irans-fighter-jet-ripoff-just-fake-news-19487,https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a4bk3/iran-qaher-f313-stealth-fighter-jet-fake-tire-psi,https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-04/6-most-absurd-military-hoaxes-by-north-korea-iran/;Iran’s 'Domestically-Manufactured' Simorgh, or a Converted Last-Century American F-5;;;;;;

Security Council, to act immediately to force Israel to stop its attacks on the Palestinian people.”Malaysia, along with Muslim majority Southeast Asian states Brunei and Indonesia, issued a joint statement condemning “in the strongest term[s]” what they called Israel’s “blatant violations and aggressions” and targeting of civilians “throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.”Malaysia has long supported the Palestinian independence cause and has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel.But as violence rages over 4,700 miles away, some Malaysians have expressed concern they could get caught up in the hostilities.Recently, many Malaysian social media users have either stated that Israel is at war with their country or questioned whether such a war would occur. Others described Malaysia as being on Israel’s “war list,” along with Iran, Qatar and Turkey, among other countries.A Twitter user, for example, wrote:“When Israel declared war yesterday with Malaysia, they were worried about going to hotspots such as KLCC (Kuala Lumpur city center), Pavilion (shopping center) etc for fear of being attacked. Remember a few years ago there was a Palestinian killed in Malaysia by an Israeli agency. This is serious …, we are at war.”Some have linked Malaysian and Indonesian hacker attacks targeting Israeli databases and social media accounts to the alleged Israeli aggression against Malaysia.However, it is false to claim that Israel has declared war on Malaysia.Much of the speculation about the potential for war appears linked to a misunderstanding of a news report that has been circulating online but is itself of dubious origin.A number of users linked to a YouTube video titled “BREAKING: ISRAEL DECLARES WAR ON HAMAS WORLDWIDE, WILL GO AFTER LEADERS IN IRAN, QATAR, MALAYSIA.”That video has been viewed over 600,000 times since May 15. It is based on a report by the Greek-language website War News 24/7 claiming that Israel’s leadership ordered its secret services to “to eliminate top Hamas officials inside and outside the country!”It did not mention Israel declaring war on Malaysia or any other state.Malaysian authorities, in turn, have said they are taking the War News 24/7 report seriously.“The police, along with other security agencies, have stepped up security control in all aspects to defend public order and the safety of Malaysians, including Palestinians in this country,” MalaysiaNow quoted Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin as saying.Reports that Israeli security forces might target Palestinian militants abroad are merited.Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that works in conjunction with the Israeli government, tweeted on May 15 that the Israel Defense Forces, according to Israel’s Channel 13, had been given “a green light” to target “*all* Hamas operatives at *all* levels, both inside Gaza and out.”He added that this move had obvious implications for countries like Malaysia, which he accused of being “an important jurisdiction for Hamas operations.”Still, Schanzer maintained Malaysia should be aware, “not because more Hamas operatives might experience ‘accidents’ in the country. But because Malaysia could meet criteria as a state sponsor of terror if this activity is done with direct assistance from Malaysia’s leaders.”A Palestinian man inspects the damage of a six-story building which was destroyed by an early morning Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, Tuesday on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.Polygraph.info reached out to Israel’s U.S. mission for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Israel’s history of targeted killings, which some call a euphemism for assassination, is contentious.In 2006, Israel’s Supreme Court noted that some targeted killings of Palestinians militants might be illegal under international law. But the court rejected a petition to declare them illegal, opting instead for a “case by case” approach.Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have condemned the practice.One such attack was allegedly conducted on Malaysian soil. In April 2018, Palestinian Fadi al-Batsh, an engineering lecturer and Hamas member who had lived in Malaysia since 2011, was shot dead in Kuala Lumpur.Hamas, a Palestinian militant organization that controls the Gaza Strip, blamed Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency for the killing.Israel denied any role in the incident.Israeli intelligence has been linked to a number of such killings abroad.;https://abc7.com/israel-palestine-conflict-airstrikes-vs-what-is-happening-in-jerusalem/10619354/,https://www.pmo.gov.my/2021/05/joint-leaders-statement-of-indonesia-malaysia-and-brunei-darussalam-on-the-escalation-of-violence-by-israelis-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/,https://twitter.com/afifauzi_/status/1393831914109169668,https://twitter.com/naimazharrrr/status/1394146880842473472,https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2021/05/816949/lebih-120-laman-israel-digodam-sejak-malam-tadi,https://youtu.be/4Xr31XfRxvM,https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5145306,https://warnews247.gr/,https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2021/05/690629/israeli-security-threat-malaysia-beefs-security-public-urged-remain-calm,https://www.malaysianow.com/news/2021/05/16/putrajaya-takes-seriously-reports-of-israeli-threat-to-launch-attacks-in-malaysia/,https://twitter.com/JSchanzer/status/1393922388669214725,https://twitter.com/JSchanzer/status/1393922388669214725,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/books/review/ronen-bergman-rise-and-kill-first.html,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6178641.stm,https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-22-mn-28553-story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-palestinian/gunmen-shoot-dead-palestinian-lecturer-in-malaysia-idUSKBN1HS0B0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43854982,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38354958;Malaysian Twitizens Invent War With Israel;;;;;;
195;;;;False;Press TV;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/6742943.html;Iranian State TV Invents ’Mystery’ About 1980 Embassy Siege;2021-05-06;polygraph;;May 5 marked the 41st anniversary of the end of the siege of Iran’s embassy in London. On that day in 1980, British Special Air Service’s (SAS) counterterrorism team members executed a lightning raid, killing all but one of six terrorists who had held embassy staff and visitors hostage for nearly six days. The assault, code-named Operation Nimrod, has become a textbook case of a successful hostage rescue operation. It also further enhanced the international prestige of the SAS, which already had an impressive reputation dating back to World War II.The embassy seizure has been the subject of books, documentaries and two feature films – “Who Dares Wins” in 1982, and, more recently, the Netflix film “6 Days.” It has also inspired several video games, including “Counter-Strike” and Tom Clancy’s “Rainbow Six” series.Although military historians and others have pored over the events for more than four decades, on May 4, the eve of the 41st anniversary, the Iranian state news outlet Press TV published an article alleging the episode was shrouded “in mystery” and “unanswered questions.” The article implied the seizure may somehow have been engineered by the U.K. as a slight against Iran, possibly to burnish the SAS’s reputation.Calling the embassy seizure “an event with multiple hidden dimensions, and one which the U.K. is deeply reluctant to illuminate,” the article states: “While the six-day siege – April 30 to May 5 1980 – was a tragedy for Iran – as demonstrated by the cold blooded killing of two embassy workers – by contrast the incident proved to be a bonanza for the U.K.’s Special Air Service (SAS), which subsequently cashed in on the incident by exporting its services and expertise to special forces around the world.” The article concludes: “More than four decades later, we are none the wiser as to what precisely motivated the embassy seizure and who were the ultimate controllers of the terrorist gang.” The claim that motivations of the terrorists are a mystery and the insinuation that the U.K. might have been involved are false.“According to conventional wisdom the six terrorists were Iranian Arab separatists employed by Baathist-era Iraqi intelligence services,” the article states. “Using Iraqi passports the majority of the terrorists arrived in London in late March 1980 and rented a flat in the wealthy district of Earl’s Court, West London.” The article accurately notes that the suspects were known to come home to their rented apartment drunk or with prostitutes.“The British Security Service (MI5) prides itself in its ability to detect and disrupt clandestine activity of the most sophisticated kind,” the article states. “So the question remains as to why MI5 and its partners in Special Branch were not able to detect the terrorist planning and intent of a group of amateurish terrorists who made little to no effort to not attract attention to themselves.”In fact, it was a busy time for terror in London during that period. In 1980, the U.K. was still in the midst of a bombing campaign by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and the previous decade had seen dozens of IRA bombings or attempted bombings in London. Targets included the House of Parliament and the Tower of London, as well as military facilities and public places in the British capital. (Four years after the Iranian embassy incident, IRA operatives carried out a bombing in the city of Brighton that nearly killed then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.) The 1970s saw multiple high-profile attacks carried out by Middle East terrorist groups, many of them connected with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Black September, another Palestinian group operating across Europe. In 1973, a PFLP-trained Venezuelan terrorist, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a.k.a. Carlos the Jackal, shot Joseph Sieff, chairman of the retailer Marks & Spencer and vice president of the British Zionist Federation, at his London home. Sieff survived the assassination attempt. In 1978, a PFLP gunman carried out an attack on a bus carrying flight crew from Israel’s El-Al Airlines.In the case of Iran’s embassy, there is no mystery or doubt about the motives or identities of the terrorists. Press TV attempts to cast doubt on the idea that the men could have been connected to Iraqi intelligence due to their amateurish behavior before the attack, but in fact such reckless behavior was not unknown among terrorists operating abroad then.The embassy attackers were essentially proxies belonging to an insurgent organization called the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA). While it is known that they received support from Iraqi intelligence, their group was also very young, founded in 1979 when it initially supported the Iranian Islamic revolution but soon turned against the new regime. The group’s goal was independence for the majority-Arab province of Khuzestan in Western Iran. Iraq, then ruled by Saddam Hussein and his pan-Arabist Ba’ath party, saw Arab separatists as natural allies against Tehran, and the region became a major battleground when Iraqi forces invaded Iran later in 1980.The Press TV article implies something suspicious about the way one of the hostage-takers, Fowzi Nejad, was taken alive. “The story gets even more bizarre when – despite the gravity of his crimes – Fowzi Nejad was released from prison in 2008 and allowed to settle in the U.K., despite the British authorities’ right to deport him,” the article states. “This has inevitably raised difficult questions about the true identity and role of Fowzi Nejad. A lingering suspicion that refuses to go away is the possibility of Fowzi Nejad having been a British agent all along tasked with infiltrating an ostensibly Iraqi-directed terrorist group.” That is false. Nejad was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled in 2008. Although the British government denied him asylum, it was prohibited from deporting him under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which forbids deporting individuals to countries where they would face torture or execution.The Press TV article concludes with the assertion: “The U.K. has yet to formally apologize to Iran for failing in its duty to protect its embassy in London.” That is misleading. First, the Iranian government publicly thanked the British police for their actions during the siege. Secondly, Britain subsequently worked out a deal to compensate Iran for damage to the embassy caused by the raid. (According to the BBC, as part of the deal Iran also compensated Britain for damage to the U.K. embassy in Tehran during the Islamic uprising.)As for the heightened prestige of the SAS following the raid, that is not extraordinary given that such counterterrorism operations were relatively novel in those days, and the successful SAS operation at the Iranian embassy was seen on TV worldwide.Sim Harris, the BBC sound man, left, leaps to safety from the Iranian Embassy in London on May 5, 1980, as the siege is brought to a close by the action of the police and units of the Special Air Service.So, contrary to Press TV’s assertions, the supposed “questions” about the incident – the terrorists, the raid and the aftermath – were answered long ago.;https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-52460013,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-security-bombings/timeline-worst-ira-bomb-attacks-on-mainland-britain-idUKTRE74F31Q20110516,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/720640.stm,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/720640.stm;Iranian State TV Invents ’Mystery’ About 1980 Embassy Siege;;;;;;
196;;;;False;Hun Sen;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-hun-sen-press-freedom/6742942.html;After Crushing Free Media, Cambodia’s Hun Sen Claims to 'Place High Value' on Journalism;2021-05-06;polygraph;;"Marking the 28th annual World Press Freedom Day, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen published a letter on May 3 calling on news media to be guided by ethics and professionalism.“I sincerely appreciate and place high value on our journalists who have made great efforts to overcome obstacles and dangers in fulfilling their duties to actively broadcast and publish news on what is really happening in the country,” the Phnom Penh Post cites him as saying.Hun Sen called on local and international media to follow the law and refrain from “spreading fake news” that damages reputations and fosters “social chaos.”""It’s the way to fight against criminals who seek to gain personal interests by using media as a cover to commit offenses that affect people’s dignity and the prestige of the media and professional journalists. This cannot be tolerated,” Hun Sen said.Hun Sen’s claim to place a high value on journalism is false. The evidence suggests that those in Cambodia who actively report on “what is really happening in the country” face intimidation, assault and imprisonment.Also on May 3, dozens of Cambodian nongovernmental organizations released a statement calling on authorities “to cease the ongoing harassment of independent media outlets and journalists for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression” amid a deteriorating media environment.The journalist advocacy group Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) 2020 World Press Freedom Index, which rates the media environment in 180 countries and territories, placed Cambodia toward the bottom (144th).RSF stated that, prior to Cambodia’s July 2018 election, Hun Sen, fearing he could lose his grip after 36 years in power, launched “a major pre-emptive offensive against the media that devastated the journalistic landscape.”That offensive included an outright ban on radio and newspapers critical of his government as well as a “purge” of staff at non-compliant news organizations.In September 2017, the independent Cambodia Daily closed following what it called “extra-legal threats by the government.”A woman buys the final issue of The Cambodia Daily newspaper at a store along a street in Phnom Penh on September 4, 2017. REUTERS/Samrang PringIn 2018, the Phenom Penh Post underwent a massive editorial shakeup following what the advocacy group Human Rights Watch called its “coerced sale” to a Malaysian businessman tied to Hun Sen.RSF stated: “Cambodians now only have access to news provided by major media groups directly linked to Hun Sen.”The Phenom Penh-based Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM) reported in February 2018 that the “facade of media freedom collapsed in 2017,” with authorities shuttering “32 radio stations carrying opposition, U.S.-funded or independent content.”CCIM likewise linked that sea change to the July 2018 elections, and noted that journalists were being accused of “incitement” and espionage amid claims that “foreign agents” were working to overthrow the government.The number of journalists who reported they had been attacked increased by 12% since 2015, the group reported, and 47% of those surveyed said they had been threatened.“Journalists at outlets considered to be independent were more than twice as likely to have been verbally or physically attacked this year, at 20%,” CCIM wrote.Journalists have also been arrested. Two Radio Free Asia journalists, Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin, were picked up in November 2017 on what Human Rights Watch called “baseless espionage charges.”The arrests came soon after RFA, which is U.S. government-funded but editorially independent, shuttered its Cambodian operations after nearly 20 years. RFA said the closure followed “a relentless crackdown by Prime Minister Hun Sen's authoritarian regime on independent media.”The Cambodia Daily’s Aun Pheap and Zsombor Peter were charged with “incitement to commit a felony” after reporting from a constituency in Ratanakiri province in May 2017 that Hun Sen had failed to win in 2012 communal elections.Reporters Without Borders said the journalists had been hit with “absurd, trumped up charges” intended to “intimidate all of Cambodia’s journalists.”The case against The Cambodia Daily journalists was dropped in November 2020. However Peter, who contributes to the Voice of America (a sister news agency to RFA), said the court’s decision not to proceed with the case meant little for the Cambodian press, as others are still being prosecuted for “doing their jobs.”In November 2020, Ros Sokhet, who runs the Khmer-language news website Cheat Khmer, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for “incitement to provoke serious chaos in social security.”His crime: Facebook posts criticizing plans by Hun Sen to name his son as his successor and a lack of government action on debt relief for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.In December 2020, Sok Oudom, who runs the Rithysen 99.75 FM radio station and news website, was sentenced to 20 months in prison for reporting on a land dispute involving the military.In October 2020, Sovann Rithy, who runs the Facebook news outlet FB TV, received a suspended 18-month sentence for repeating Hun Sen’s own comments. Hun Sen had previously told motorcycle taxi drivers hit financially by the COVID-19 pandemic to sell their vehicles to buy food, as the government could not help them.In December 2020, Rath Rott Mony, a fixer for Russian state-owned broadcaster RT, was released from jail after serving two years for a documentary about child prostitution that Cambodian authorities called “fake news.”In May 2020, the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights released a statement saying “at least a dozen journalists have been summoned and questioned by police and judicial authorities as a result of their reporting.”Citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the pretext for an intensified media crackdown, the group said “[t]he ongoing arrest, detention and judicial harassment of journalists for critical reporting is a serious violation of the Cambodian people’s right to information.”Cambodia’s media crackdown has been accompanied by a clampdown on free speech and political participation.Since 2017, the government has systematically dismantled the political opposition, banning the Cambodia National Rescue Party and prosecuting its leaders.The rights group Amnesty International estimates 150 people affiliated with the CNRP are facing mass trials on charges the group calls “an affront to international fair trial standards.”In February, Hun Sen signed a sub-decree to set up a National Internet Gateway (NIG). Critics fear the NIG will mirror China’s “Great Firewall,” which strictly monitors and censors online content.";https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/press-05032021192528.html,https://rsf.org/en/cambodia,https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/03/548296895/cambodia-daily-newspaper-to-close-after-24-years,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/08/cambodia-coerced-sale-last-independent-newspaper,https://www.ccimcambodia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Challenges-for-Independent-Media-2017-English.pdf,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/19/cambodia-drop-charges-against-2-journalists,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/crackdown-raf-09122017084157.html,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/ex-cambodia-daily-reporter-no-clue-what-triggered-criminal-charges,https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/parties-battle-for-lonely-ratanakkiri-commune-130576/,https://rsf.org/en/news/cambodia-urged-drop-trumped-charges-against-two-journalists,https://www.voacambodia.com/a/ratanakkiri-court-drops-incitement-charges-against-cambodia-daily-reporters/5678900.html,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/cambodia-convicts-journalist-criticizing-hun-sen,https://rsf.org/en/news/cambodian-journalist-jailed-two-facebook-posts-critical-hun-sen,https://cpj.org/2020/12/cambodia-sentences-journalist-sok-oudom-to-20-months-in-prison/,https://www.voacambodia.com/a/online-journalist-convicted-and-given-suspended-sentence-for-quoting-hun-sen-/5609194.html,https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/cambodia-journalist-arrested-for-reporting-hun-sens-advice-on-covid-19.htm,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/release-12112020140013.html,https://www.licadho-cambodia.org/pressrelease.php?perm=452,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-cambodia-coup-case-verdict/31136250.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/cambodia-opposition-mass-trials/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-cambodia-national-int,ernet-gateway/31115763.html;After Crushing Free Media, Cambodia’s Hun Sen Claims to 'Place High Value' on Journalism;;;;;;
197;;;;Misleading;Fariz Mehdawi;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-mosque-destruction-xinjiang-china/6742939.html;Palestinian Envoy Touts Number of Xinjiang Mosques, Ignores Demolition Evidence;2021-05-04;polygraph;;"During the April 27 edition of “The Point with Liu Xin"", a current affairs program on China’s state-run CGTN, ambassadors from Pakistan, Palestine, and Syria weighed in on the situation in Xinjiang.The English-language program was billed as providing a corrective to Western politicians and media, accusing them of intentionally overlooking “the economic, social and cultural rights” that Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities “enjoy in the region.”Of the three diplomats, two – Pakistani ambassador to China Moin ul Haque and Palestinian ambassador to China Fariz Mehdawi – went on Chinese Foreign Ministry-sponsored tours of Xinjiang, the Northwest region that is home to much of the Uyghur population the United States and others say is the target of persecution.Xin’s leading questions stressed that ethnic minorities in the region are able to preserve their cultures and customs while coexisting with the Han Chinese minority there. Her guests agreed.Ul Haque described Xinjiang as a place of ethnic harmony and diversity, where languages and cultures are being preserved. Mehdawi touted the region’s religious freedom, even joking there are “too many” mosques in Xinjiang.“You know, the average of mosques, if you have to calculate it all, it’s something like 2,000 inhabitants for one mosque. This ratio we don’t have it in our country. It’s not available anywhere,” Mehdawi said.Ethnic minority students attend a class at the Urumqi Islamic Institution during a government-organized trip for foreign journalists in Urumqi on April 22.“Of course those mosques have been built a long time ago, which have been very well maintained … [The mosques are] accessible the whole day and night, actually. Some of them are actually modern. We [visited] some mosques that are newly built during the last four or five years,” he said. The comments of Mehdawi and the other panelists largely mirrored misleading Chinese government talking points.After more evidence surfaced last year that the China government had razed thousands of mosques in the region, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had released a statement echoing Mehdawi’s comments, claiming there are more than 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, or “a mosque for every 530 Muslims in Xinjiang, which is more mosques per capita than many Muslim countries.”Various investigations and news reports run counter to that claim and suggest an accelerated campaign of mosque destruction started in 2016.In August of that year, Chen Quanguo was promoted to the post of Xinjiang's party secretary, the region's top official. Earlier, while serving as Tibet's party secretary, Chen is widely believed to have introduced a comprehensive system of social control in that region, where a massive crackdown on religious freedom and allegations of cultural genocide (from the United States and others) persist.The estimate that there are 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang comes from the Chinese government’s 2004 Economic Census.There is significant evidence that figure is no longer current.In December 2016, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported that the Chinese Central Ethnic-Religious Affairs Department had launched a “Mosque Rectification,” putatively to promote public safety. Some 5,000 mosques were reportedly destroyed during the three-month campaign.Wang Jingfu, head of Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee in Kashgar, confirmed the majority of the southern Xinjiang city’s mosques had been destroyed.“We demolished nearly 70 percent of mosques in the city, because there were more than enough mosques and some were unnecessary,” Wang told RFA, reiterating that public safety was a primary concern.Residents of other areas reported similar levels of destruction, and local officials confirmed those reports.A July 2019 joint investigation by the Guardian newspaper and the investigative news site Bellingcat found that dozens of religious sites had been razed in Xinjiang since 2016. Their researchers analyzed 91 religious sites using satellite imagery, and found that 31 mosques and two major shrines had suffered “significant structural damage” between 2016 and 2018.Another 15 were found to have been destroyed or nearly destroyed. Former Xinjiang residents pointed out nine other sites that did not bear the typical outward features associated with mosques but were also locations where mosques apparently had been razed.The previous month, Agence France-Presse reported that 36 mosques and religious sites in Xinjiang had “been torn down or had their domes and corner spires removed since 2017.”The Uyghur Human Rights Project, a research-based advocacy organization located in Washington, D.C, reported in October 2019 that more than 100 mosques in the region had either been “fully destroyed or had an architectural element removed.”Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported in October 2020 that mosques in the regional capital of Urumqi and the city of Kashgar had been turned into cafes, rest areas, and other tourist sites for Han Chinese.RFA reported on April 29 of this year that a mosque believed to be the oldest in the city of Ghulja was leased to a businessman from Beijing and converted into a tourist hotel.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) estimated in September 2020 that 16,000, or about 65%, of Xinjiang’s mosques had been “destroyed or damaged as a result of government policies, mostly since 2017.” An estimated 8,500 were demolished.ASPI said important Islamic shrines, cemeteries and pilgrimage routes were demolished during the same period. The institute estimated that fewer than 15,500 mosques were left in Xinjiang, including 7,500 that had been “damaged to some extent.”ASPI said it arrived at those estimates by employing “a sample-based methodology to make statistically robust estimates of the region-wide rates of destruction.”More specifically, ASPI located 900 sites, including 533 mosques and 382 shrines and other religious sites that existed prior to a 2017 crackdown, and cross referenced them against satellite imagery from 2019-2020. ASPI then extrapolated from observed rates of destruction to make regionwide estimates.All those reports fit into a broader pattern of discrimination toward Islam.A BBC report on mosque destruction, for example, said it had discovered public announcements prohibiting young men from wearing long beards.A January RFA 2020 report on the so-called “Sanxin Huodong” or “Three News” campaign found that authorities were forcing Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities to abandon traditional furnishings like rugs and pillows and replace them with more “sinicized” household items.That followed a $575 million lifestyle “modernization” campaign, under which traditional Uyghur architectural and design elements were destroyed.Uyghurs also reportedly have been compelled to eat pork and drink alcohol, which are proscribed by Islam.In October 2020, Chinese authorities reportedly banned Muslim believers from making private pilgrimages to Mecca, one of the five pillars of Islam. Those allowed to go are provided GPS trackers to make their trips “better and safer,” the CCP-run Global Times newspaper reported.";https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-04-27/What-do-three-ambassadors-talk-about-Xinjiang-with-Liu-Xin--ZMA1UeE2T6/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-mosques/china-foreign-ministry-denies-think-tank-claims-of-xinjiang-mosque-destruction-idUSKCN26H083,https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/20/china-alarming-new-surveillance-security-tibet,https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3210/2,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/udner-the-guise-of-public-safety-12192016140127.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/07/revealed-new-evidence-of-chinas-mission-to-raze-the-mosques-of-xinjiang,https://hongkongfp.com/2019/06/08/razed-mosques-pervasive-surveillance-make-tense-ramadan-chinas-xinjiang/,https://docs.uhrp.org/pdf/UHRP_report_Demolishing_Faith.pdf,http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13821568,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/mosque-04292021181310.html,https://www.aspi.org.au/report/cultural-erasure,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-48696184,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/furniture-01092020165529.html,https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/sinicization/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/4/holduighurs-forced-to-eat-pork-as-hog-farming-in-xinjiang-expands,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/pork-11222019161208.html,https://observatoryihr.org/news/china-bans-private-hajj-pilgrimages-in-latest-move-to-suppress-its-muslim-population/,https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1113056.shtml;Palestinian Envoy Touts Number of Xinjiang Mosques, Ignores Demolition Evidence;;;;;;

The arrests were part of a special operation that nabbed suspects in Irkutsk, Chita, Tambov, Krasnodar and several other Russian cities. The suspects allegedly belong to MKU, which stands for “Youth Murder Cult” in Russian. Russia’s Investigative Committee claims the suspects received instructions on how to use explosives from Yegor Krasnov, a Ukrainian national from the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.The arrests were the latest in a series that began in February, when three alleged MKU members were picked up in the Russian city of Voronezh in connection with beatings and extremist graffiti. In March, 14 alleged MKU supporters were arrested in the cities of Gelendzhik and Yaroslavl.Calling these suspects “Ukrainians” or “Ukrainian radicals,” however, is highly misleading. No evidence has been produced showing that any of the suspects are Ukrainian citizens.According to the Ukrainian counter-propaganda organization StopFake, the three suspects arrested in Voronezh in February – Roman Grebenshchikov, Ilya Shmelyov and Alexander Simonov – had ties to a Russian nationalist organization known as the “Russian Corps.” The group posted a statement on the Russian social media network VK acknowledging that the men had once been affiliated with its Voronezh chapter.“The three did not have any sort of connection with pro-Ukrainian resources or organizations,” the Russian Corps statement read. “For a short time they were members of the Voronezh cell of RK (Russian Corps).”StopFake also spoke to one of the Voronezh arrestees, Grebenshchikov, who denied having any ties to Ukraine or Ukrainian nationalists, or any knowledge of MKU, the group authorities alleged he was connected to. StopFake found photos from Grebenshchikov’s VK profile showing him present at Russian nationalist rallies and displaying symbols typically associated with Russian, not Ukrainian, nationalists. In a February 18 story on the arrest of the suspects in Voronezh, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti included a video showing the various extremist materials allegedly found in the suspects’ possession. Those materials included Russian nationalist and German neo-Nazi symbols, as well as what appears to be a German edition of Hitler’s Mein Kampf, but nothing bearing Ukrainian symbols of any kind.The BBC Russian service also published a story on the arrests which included a photo of more extremist material allegedly found on the suspects arrested in Gelendzhik in March. Again, only general neo-Nazi or Russian nationalist items were on display. Nevertheless, Russian state media routinely label the alleged MKU members later arrested as ""Ukrainian neo-Nazis"" or ""Ukrainian radicals,"" even though they all appear to be Russian citizens. In one case, a Radio Sputnik headline refers to the suspects as ""Ukrainians"" even though there is no evidence to suggest this and the article doesn't mention anything about their citizenship or ethnicity.What is the source of the Ukraine branding, then? Well, it goes back to Yegor Krasnov, a Ukrainian resident of Dnipro who is the purported founder of the MKU. Krasnov , 20, was arrested by Ukrainian police in Dnipro in January 2020 and has been in detention since. He is on trial for a series of violent attacks in Ukraine. According to the April 29 RIA Novosti article, the FSB claimed that the 16 terror suspects they arrested were in contact with Krasnov, who gave them instructions to carry out bombings and other terrorist attacks. These also allegedly included instructions on how to make and employ explosives.An investigation into the group by Current Time, a TV program produced by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in cooperation with the Voice of America (VOA), included a profile of Krasnov, in which former classmates and friends described him as a violent hooligan who “loved to fight.” One former classmate said that Krasnov had been committed to a psychiatric institution, possibly either for drug use or aggressive behavior. Another acquaintance claimed Krasnov had used methamphetamine.According to Current Time, Krasnov had at least some access to the Telegram internet messaging service, through which the other suspects were able to correspond with him on a limited basis.Krasnov appears to be the only link that any of the suspects, who are Russian citizens living in Russia, have with Ukraine. The RIA Novosti story on the recent arrests, as well as the earlier arrests, cites FSB interrogations as the source of the claims about Krasnov allegedly giving his contacts in Russia instructions. The Daily Beast on April 30 quoted Alexander Verkhovsky, head of Moscow’s SOVA Center, which monitors extremist violence in Russia, saying that while it was possible far-right individuals in Ukraine “dared” like-minded counterparts in Russia to engage in increasingly serious acts of violence, Ukrainian state involvement is doubtful.Verkhovsky told The Daily Beast: “We have plenty of our own Russian far-right radicals, who might be preparing nasty actions. They don’t need some arrested Ukrainian nationalist to tell them what to do.”Further complicating the matter is that the FSB and Russian police have an established history of planting evidence on suspects, including drugs, weapons, explosives and extremist literature. Such incriminating “discoveries” are extremely common in raids against Crimean Tatars and pro-Ukrainian residents of Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014. In April, Vladislav Yesypenko, a Ukrainian Crimean working for RFE/RL, was arrested by the FSB and charged with weapons possession after being accused of spying for Ukraine. Yesypenko claimed authorities planted a grenade in his car and threatened him with death unless he signed a confession.Without more information about the suspects in these MKU-related arrests, it is difficult to assess their true involvement in any plot. What is clear is that they were not “Ukrainians,” as Russian state media has repeatedly labeled them.";https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukrainian-nazis-detained-in-voronezh/,https://ria.ru/20210218/neonatsisty-1597951872.html,https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-56458156,https://russian.rt.com/russia/news/857732-fsb-zaderzhanie-radikalov,https://ria.ru/20210429/fsb-1730426721.html,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20210429/fsb-1730440434.html,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20210429/radikaly-1730431539.html,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kremlin-claims-it-busted-neo-nazi-terror-plot-in-9-cities,https://www.currenttime.tv/a/chto-takoe-m-k-u/31171118.html,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kremlin-claims-it-busted-neo-nazi-terror-plot-in-9-cities,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/ex-russian-police-officer-tells-court-he-was-ordered-plant-drugs-reporter,http://khpg.org/en/1454075610,http://khpg.org/en/1591749855,https://cpj.org/2021/03/rfe-rl-contributor-vladislav-yesypenko-arrested-accused-of-espionage-in-crimea/,http://khpg.org/en/1608808962;Russia Points at Ukraine With Dubious Terror Plot Involving … Russians!;;;;;;
199;;;;Likely False;Xinhua News Agency;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-vietnam-no-opposition/6742935.html;Did Vietnam’s President Vow to Never Oppose China? Doubtful.;2021-05-03;polygraph;;On April 26, China’s State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe led a high-ranking military delegation to meet with Vietnamese leaders in the capital Hanoi.State media in both countries stressed strengthening ties and bolstering strategic cooperation for peace, stability and development.Chinese state media stressed the need to prevent disputes in the South China Sea from harming relations and to address competing issues with trust and respect.Their reports further claimed that Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc had strongly come out against foreign powers meddling in China’s affairs.“Phuc said Vietnam firmly upholds the one-China principle and opposes any forces' interference in China's internal affairs.“Vietnam will stay on guard against and firmly resist any schemes to undermine the Vietnam-China relations, and will never follow other countries in opposing China,” China’s Xinhua News Agency reported Phuc saying at the meeting.The claim that Phuc said Vietnam will never oppose China is likely false.No audio or video of the meeting has been published. Any such proclamation would likely be received poorly in Vietnam, where China is regarded with suspicion. A well-connected expert told Voice of America's Vietnamese service that, according to his source at the meeting, Phuc did not use those words.Vietnam's newly elected President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, left, and newly elected Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh pose for a photo in the National Assembly in Hanoi on April 5.“Phuc never said that,” said Ha Hoang Hop, a visiting senior fellow for Vietnamese Studies at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.Hop based his opinion on a source who was present at the meeting and who requested anonymity to relay the private sessions. “Vietnamese leaders never say anything [so specifically] detailing its relationship with China,” Hop said.He also cited Vietnam’s “three no’s” policy — no military alliances, no aligning with one country against another, and no foreign military bases on Vietnamese soil — to argue that such a blanket statement would be at odds with Vietnam’s defense and foreign policy strategies.Hop said that Phuc, a former prime minister who just became president on April 5, has experience dealing with Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and would never make statements that run counter to Vietnam’s interests.Commentary posted on Cánh Cò, a news website Hop said is run by Task Force 47, a cyberspace military unit of Vietnam's Defense Department, said that Phuc did discuss a “four no's” policy at the meeting.However, Thu An, the style and opinion editor who authored the piece, said the policy position to never align with one country against another is not specific to China, and could just as well refer to “Laos, Cambodia, America, France, India, or Russia.”An states that the “misreporting” is believed to be “the responsibility of some media” and not the intention of the Chinese government.“Unfortunately, such actions further deteriorate China's image in the international arena,” An wrote.Hoang Viet, an expert on the South China Sea who lectures at Ho Chi Minh City University of Law, told VOA that relations between Vietnam and China recently soured despite Vietnam’s non-aligned stance, while Vietnam’s ties with the U.S. are growing stronger and are viewed by Hanoi as more beneficial.Former U.S. President Donald Trump and then Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc hold flags as they are greeted by students during their meeting at the Office of Government Hall in Hanoi, on Feb 27, 2019.Both Polygraph.info and VOA’s Vietnamese service reached out to the Vietnamese government to confirm the Phuc comments without success. The Vietnamese government has not officially disputed the Chinese characterization.More broadly, there’s reason to believe such a position would be politically untenable in Vietnam. According to a Global Attitudes Survey conducted by Pew Research in 2017, 90% of Vietnamese said China’s growing military power is “a bad thing.”Some 80% of respondents agreed that China’s power and influence was a major threat to Vietnam, with only 12% calling it a minor threat.Tensions have been exacerbated by China’s actions in the South China Sea and sweeping claims over the waters, seabed and subsoil, despite international rulings safeguarding the rights of Vietnam and other countries in the region.Beijing has laid claim to the Spratly Islands, an archipelago that lies off the coasts of the Philippines, Malaysia, and southern Vietnam. The archipelago is disputed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.As Polygraph.info previously reported, to project military power in the region, China has established outposts in the Spratly Islands, as well as deployed anti-ship cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air missiles.China has repeatedly sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the Paracel Islands — another South China Sea archipelago, which is equidistant from both states and also claimed by Taiwan. China effectively seized control of the Parcel Islands in January 1974 after a military engagement with what was then the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).An attack on Vietnamese fishing vessels in April 2020 drew protest from Hanoi, to no effect. Two months later, a Chinese coast guard vessel attacked another Vietnamese fishing boat in the region.China has also reportedly used the threat of force to halt Vietnamese oil drilling projects off Vietnam’s southeastern coast.More recently, Vietnam and other countries have rejected the legitimacy of thousands of domestic trademarks China filed for myriad land features scattered throughout the South China Sea, Radio Free Asia reported.However, China continues to militarize the region. In January, Beijing passed a bill giving its coast guard the right to fire on ships in disputed waters, inspect ships in Chinese-claimed waters and destroy structures on Chinese-claimed reefs, Reuters reported.And despite Chinese opposition to the Indo-Pacific strategy forged by former U.S. President Donald Trump, which seeks to give all Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN) an “equal stake in determining the future of the region,” analysts say Hanoi has privately supported Washington’s engagement in the region.China’s Communist Party-run Global Times claimed the U.S. strategy “will undermine regional integration, unity and peace” and asserted that Vietnam does not “want to be made use of” in that way.Speaking to the Times, Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, cited Phuc’s alleged statement about never opposing China.Xu claimed Vietnam was sending “a clear signal to the U.S. and other Western countries outside the region that Vietnam will not be used by any external forces.”;https://vietnamnews.vn/politics-laws/934337/armies-successful-ties-help-reinforce-viet-nam-china-relations-president.html,http://www.voatiengviet.com/a/chủ-tịch-nguyễn-xuân-phúc-cam-kết-không-theo-nước-khác-chống-trung-quốc-/5869994.html,https://canhco.net/ve-loi-phat-bieukhong-theo-nuoc-nao-chong-trung-quoc-p514303.html?fbclid=IwAR1_6W5lDZ7uCru7eJucmQ-xqCLGUpjZZsZiEuXDcJeUh9W2qxMnU7Y6DPU,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/16/how-people-in-asia-pacific-view-china/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-expansionism-south-china-sea/31217558.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN21M072,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-fisheries-society-condemns-china-attack-on-boat-demands-compensation-4115245.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/vietnam-halts-south-china-sea-oil-drilling-project-under-pressure-from-beijing-idUSKBN1GZ0JN,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/mark-04132021192429.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coastguard-law/china-authorises-coast-guard-to-fire-on-foreign-vessels-if-needed-idUSKBN29R1ER,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Free-and-Open-Indo-Pacific-4Nov2019.pdf,https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/vietnam-would-be-pleased-with-the-biden-administration-for-the-most-part/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/vietnam-communists-look-to-biden-to-offset-growing-chinese-power,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222213.shtml,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222213.shtml;Did Vietnam’s President Vow to Never Oppose China?

He also repeated past grievances, including the false claim that Western sanctions against Russia for its invasion and occupation of Crimea and other malign activities are illegal.Putin accused some countries of attempting to impose their will on others by force, a practice that is “degenerating into something much more dangerous.”“I mean the recently known facts of a direct attempt to organize a coup d'etat in Belarus and the assassination of the President of this country,” he said. “At the same time, it is characteristic that even such flagrant actions are not condemned by the so-called collective West. Simply no one seems to notice this. Everyone pretends that nothing is happening at all.”Putin’s allegations of a coup and assassination plot against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko are unsubstantiated.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (L) is welcomed upon his arrival at a Moscow airport on April 22.On April 17, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) announced it had arrested two men in Moscow for attempting to overthrow the Belarusian government. The suspects were then handed over to Bealrusian authorities.The men were identified as Alyaksandr Fyaduta, former Lukashenko spokesman turned opposition member, and Yuras Zyankovich, a lawyer with dual Belarusian-U.S. citizenship.On April 13, Zyankovich’s wife, Alena Dzenisavets, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Russian security forces had “abducted” her husband from the Nordic Rooms Hotel in Moscow two days earlier and transported him to Belarus.The FSB claimed it received information from its Belarusian counterpart, the KGB, that the plot was discussed with other opposition members and former security officials last summer via Zoom chats.According to the FSB, Zyankovich carried out “consultations in the U.S. and Poland” before meeting with Fyaduta in a Moscow restaurant to discuss the plot, Russia’s TASS news agency reported.The plot, to be carried out in conjunction with “Belarusian generals,” allegedly involved seizing radio and television stations and obstructing security forces loyal to the state.“They were preparing a blackout of the Belarusian power grid to hamper the actions of the army and law enforcement agencies. Some armed groups (guerillas) located at hidden bases were supposed to launch an active phase,” TASS cited the FSB as saying.The alleged coup was scheduled to coincide with the Victory Day Parade in Minsk on May 9, a day which holds deep emotional resonance in Belarus and Russia.Two other men were arrested in Belarus in connection with the plot.One of them, Ryhor Kastusiou, leads the Belarusian People’s Front (BPF) party and ran for president. He was arrested on April 11. His son-in-law Zmitser Antonchyk was detained on April 13. But Belsat TV, a Poland-based channel focused on Belarus, told Polygraph.info he had only been interrogated, not arrested.According to unconfirmed reports, another alleged plotter is Volha Halubovich, Yury Zyankovich's assistant in Belarus.A senior KGB official said the plotters are being charged with conspiracy to unconstitutionally seize state power and face up to 12 years in prison.The KGB claimed every stage of the alleged plot was recorded, “including by technical equipment.” However, none of that information has been released.On April 17, Lukashenko claimed, without evidence, that the plot was orchestrated by “the top political leadership” in the U.S. and included plans to murder his sons.He said the plot was likely organized by “the Central Intelligence Agency” or “the FBI,” adding: “I do not know which of the American services worked here.”Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin had raised the issue with U.S. President Joe Biden during an April 19 telephone call between the two leaders. Peskov declined to comment when asked if the Biden administration was involved in the alleged plot.The U.S. State Department said allegations of U.S. involvement in any such plot were “absolutely false.” Polish presidential minister Krzysztof Szczerski said anyone accusing Poland of involvement in the alleged plot “is lying.”Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the alleged plot “has signs of provocation by the intelligence services of Russia and Belarus.”Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya (left) and U.S. Ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher take part at a ceremony to commemorate victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Vilnius, Lithuania on April 21.Other experts agree.Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst and journalist, told Germany’s public broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) that the alleged plot is nothing more than a “banal” special service operation to implicate the Lukashenko opposition in a “fictitious conspiracy” as a pretext to arrest them.According to Shraibman, the alleged culprits were willing participants in the plot, unaware it was a sting operation.Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin (left) meets with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk on April 16.Belarusian political scientist Dmitry Bolkunets offered a similar analysis:“People were deliberately introduced into this game, and because of their incompetence they believed everything. In authoritarian countries, power never changes through elections – there is always either a revolution or military coups, and Lukashenko knows this very well.“Apparently taking advantage of this situation, the KGB of Belarus decided to involve the opposition in these actions and show that it was preparing a rebellion. At the same time, the opposition does not have any resources for such actions,” Bolkunets told DW.He added that the authorities likely tried to implicate many other opposition figures.Brian Whitmore, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, noted that the plot comes at a time when Russia is “visibly expanding” its footprint in Belarus.“At the most basic level, claims of a U.S.-backed coup advance Moscow’s goal of increasing Belarusian isolation from the West and increasing its dependence on Russia,” Whitmore said. He added it sends the “unambiguous message” to Lukashenko that he is “in Russia’s sphere of influence” and has nowhere else to turn, a message “Lukashenko appears to have received the message loud and clear.”More broadly, Whitmore says, it provides Moscow cover to establish its own “whaboutism narratives” at a time when Russia has been massing troops on Ukraine’s borders and was implicated in various plots, including the SolarWinds hack of U.S. government agencies and businesses and the alleged participation of Russian agents in blowing up a Czech ammo depot in 2014.Protesters embrace while holding a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko during a demonstration in support of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Prague on April 2.The coup allegation comes as the embattled Belarusian president faces the greatest challenge to his 26-year rule, with the mass protests that erupted following rigged elections in August 2020 leading to an increasingly draconian state crackdown on the opposition.Lukashenko is no stranger to phony allegations of coups and other malign foreign actions.As noted by DW, he has alleged seven coup attempts against him since 1994, including a purported July 2020 plot by Russian mercenaries to ""destabilize the situation during the election campaign.”As Polygraph.info and others have reported, Lukashenko has falsely accused Poland of planning to annex part of Belarus; NATO of plotting to seize Belarusian territory and create a buffer between Belarus and Russia; and Western governments attempting to stage a “Color Revolution” to topple him.Lukashenko has even accused Russia of seeking to incorporate Belarus, or unleash a war in the country, “like in Ukraine.”";https://tass.com/world/1279447,https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-lawyer-united-states-citizen-detained-moscow/31203152.html,https://tass.com/world/1279447,https://www.dw.com/en/thousands-on-the-streets-of-belarus-to-mark-victory-day-despite-pandemic/a-53378268,https://belsat.eu/en/news/13-04-2021-ex-presidential-candidate-kastusiou-arrested-in-shklou-taken-to-kgb-prison/,https://nn.by/?c=ar&i=271888,https://belsat.eu/en/news/22-04-2021-kgb-persons-involved-in-anti-lukashenka-coup-attempt-face-charge/,https://eng.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-comments-on-assassination-attempt-against-him-and-his-children-139170-2021/,https://tass.com/politics/1279835,https://www.svaboda.org/a/31210019.html,https://euroradio.pl/polshcha-usled-za-zsha-zayavila-ab-nedatychnasci-da-zmovy-suprac-lukashenki,https://belsat.eu/en/news/19-04-2021-tsikhanouskaya-s-team-comments-on-info-about-lukashenka-s-assassination-attempt/,https://www.dw.com/ru/delo-o-popytke-gosperevorota-v-belarusi-kgb-obmanul-oppozicionerov/a-57265939,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/bizarre-belarus-coup-plot-has-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-classic-kremlin-drama/,https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-expel-russian-embassy-staff-pm-says-suspected-russian-link-ammunition-2021-04-17/,https://www.dw.com/ru/delo-o-popytke-gosperevorota-v-belarusi-kgb-obmanul-oppozicionerov/a-57265939,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/07/30/russian-mercenaries-in-belarus-all-you-need-to-know-a71020,https://www.polygraph.info/a/lukashenko-belarus-poland-annexation/30984199.html,https://www.politico.eu/article/alexander-lukashenko-suggests-poland-may-try-and-annex-part-of-belarus/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-lukasheko-belarus-nato-blitzkrieg/31076721.html,https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/the-kremlin-is-pushing-belarus-to-merge-with-russia-lukashenko/,https://carnegie.ru/commentary/76900;Putin Advances Claims of U.S.-Instigated Plot to Oust, Kill Belarusian Leader;;;;;;

If we promote a war between China and American, we can, that's easy. But at what cost to us? That's the problem,” he said.Also on April 20, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying sent out a tweet proclaiming China’s peaceful ambitions on the world stage.“However strong it may grow, #China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence. Nor will China ever engage in an arms race,” Hua said.That is false. In fact, China has flouted international rulings safeguarding the rights of neighbors in the South China Sea region.In January 2013, the Philippines initiated a claim against the People’s Republic of China under Annex VII to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which covers “the role of historic rights and the source of maritime entitlements in the South China Sea.”The petition, filed with the Arbitral Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, contended that China’s claims to the bulk of the South China Sea, demarcated by the so-called nine-dash line, violated the Philippines’ rights to its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and territorial waters.The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea recognizes the 200-nautical mile stretch of sea from the coast of a state as its EEZ.Unlike territorial waters, the surface waters of the EEZ are international waters. A state, however, is allowed to explore, exploit, conserve and manage natural resources below the surface of the water and within the seabed of its EEZ.In 2009, China claimed it had “indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof.”In its July 2016 ruling, The Hague rebuked China’s sweeping claims to the sea. The ruling made clear that states are entitled to operate within their EEZs. The court, however, did not rule on issues of territorial sovereignty or maritime boundaries in the South China Sea. China declared the ruling invalid. Since then, Beijing has become more assertive in the region.According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), conceived of and designed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington D.C.-based think tank, China has established 7 outposts in the Spratly Islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea off the coasts of Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.China also seized the Scarborough Shoal, approximately 137 miles east of the Philippines’ island of Luzon. China’s military blockade of the shoal is illegal under the Hague’s 2016 ruling.In March, the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs intensified demands that China withdraw dozens of so-called “Maritime Militia” ships “moored, anchored and stationary at Julian Felipe Reef,” in the Spratly Islands and the Philippines’ EEZ, Radio Free Asia reported.Beijing also has 20 outposts in the Paracel Islands, claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan. The AMTI said three of these harbors are “capable of hosting large numbers of naval and civilian vessels.”According to a 2020 U.S. Defense Department report, China “has deployed anti-ship cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air missiles to the Spratly Islands, and fighters and SAMs to the disputed Paracel Islands.”The AMTI argues that China’s military buildup on the Paracel and Spratly islands, including the creation of artificial islands, is key to “China’s goal of establishing surveillance and power projection capabilities throughout the South China Sea.”Satellite imagery shows what the CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative calls the deployment of several new weapons systems, including a J-11 combat aircraft, at China’s base on Woody Island in the Paracels, South China Sea, May 12, 2018.Beijing’s power projection has included hostile actions towards China’s neighbors.For example, China has repeatedly sunk Vietnamese fishing boats near the Paracel Islands and reportedly used the threat of force to halt Vietnamese drilling projects that fall within the nine-dash line.Chinese vessels have also reportedly engaged in standoffs with Malaysian ships operating within Malaysia’s EEZ.Although the U.S. claims neutrality on the territorial disputes, in July 2020 the administration of then-President Donald Trump called Beijing’s claims to offshore resources throughout most of the sea “completely unlawful,” condemning “its campaign of bullying to control them.”President Joe Biden’s administration appears to be continuing that policy.In January, China passed a bill granting its coast guard the right to fire on ships in disputed waters, inspect ships in Chinese-claimed waters and destroy structures on Chinese claimed reefs, Reuters reported.The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the South China Sea on July 7, 2020.In February, the Voice of America reported that China will use the law to target neighbors with competing maritime claims. Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all maintain claims to areas of the South China Sea.A study by CSIS’s ChinaPower Project estimates that one-third of global shipping passes through the South China Sea, which is also rich in oil, gas, minerals and fisheries.China claims it is “safeguarding its peace and stability in the region” and that the United States is attempting to drive a wedge between regional states.Japan has accused China of attempting to unilaterally change the status quo through intensified military activity in the East China Sea, particularly around the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/20/duterte-west-philippine-sea-china-bloodshed.html,https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/20/21/duterte-on-chinese-ships-situated-in-west-ph-sea-i-dont-want-any-quarrel,https://pca-cpa.org/en/cases/7/,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm,https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2009re_mys_vnm_e.pdf,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-07/12/content_26061326.htm,https://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/china/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-philippines-exclu/exclusive-at-strategic-shoal-china-asserts-power-through-control-and-concessions-idUSKBN17B124,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/demand-03312021154924.html,https://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/01/2002488689/-1/-1/1/2020-DOD-CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT-FINAL.PDF,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17673426,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-chinese-vessel-rams-vietnamese-fishing-boat-in-s-china-sea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea/vietnam-protests-beijings-sinking-of-south-china-sea-boat-idUSKBN21M072,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1526701/vietnam-airs-video-chinese-ship-sinking-fishing-boat-south-china-sea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/vietnam-halts-south-china-sea-oil-drilling-project-under-pressure-from-beijing-idUSKBN1GZ0JN,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/malaysian-oil-exploration-vessel-leaves-south-china-sea-waters-after-standoff-idUSKBN22O1M9,https://asean.usmission.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in-the-south-china-sea/,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/why-biden-sends-warships-south-china-sea-just-trump-did,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coastguard-law/china-authorises-coast-guard-to-fire-on-foreign-vessels-if-needed-idUSKBN29R1ER,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/chinas-coast-guard-can-fire-foreign-vessels-complicating-security-south-sea,https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1811781.shtml,https://www.mod.go.jp/e/publ/w_paper/wp2020/pdf/R02010202.pdf;Beijing Denies Expansionism Despite South China Sea Militarization, Sweeping Claims;;;;;;
202;;;;Misleading;Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Belarus;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-belarus-sanctions/6742917.html;Belarus Distorts U.S. Message, Ignores Repression Record;2021-04-21;polygraph;;The United States has revoked a license authorizing American citizens to do limited business with nine Belarusian state-owned companies previously targeted by U.S. sanctions.The U.S. Treasury Department said on April 19 that any dealings with the companies it listed will be banned after June 3. The interim period allows U.S. firms and individuals to “wind down” transactions with the companies, the Treasury Department said.Among the nine targeted Belarusian state-owned giants are the Belarusian Oil Trade House, which exports chemical and petrochemical products, Belneftekhim, the country’s largest oil producer, and its U.S. subsidiary Belneftekhim USA Inc.– headquartered in the state of Massachusetts.Belarus responded to the U.S. sanctions with misleading claims. The country’s foreign ministry accused the U.S. of “hastiness” in making the decision and targeting the Belarusian people.“In light of recent events and reports one starts seriously wondering about the hastiness the USA demonstrated as it made this decision,” the ministry said in a statement. “[T]he step is actually aimed at worsening the material well-being of Belarusian citizens.” That does not accurately explain how and why the U.S. revoked the license allowing American citizens to do limited business with the Belarusian companies.The U.S. State Department said on April 19 that it “fully supports” the Treasury Department decision to revoke the general license as a “further consequence of the Belarusian authorities’ flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus’ failure to comply with its obligations under international human rights law.”It noted that more than 340 people in Belarus have been detained and arrested for political reasons.Belarusian law enforcement vehicles on a street in Minsk, March 25, 2021.The U.S. initially imposed sanctions on Belarus in 2006, with then-President George W. Bush citing “the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus… manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections.”Bush said those Belarusian officials had committed “human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances,” and had engaged in “public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.” Those actions, Bush said, constituted “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.”In other words, the 2006 sanctions were the U.S. response to the political processes in Belarus, which the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) described as lacking “minimum transparency.” The OSCE also condemned the Belarusian government’s unwillingness to “tolerate political competition,” saying authorities there “routinely harassed, detained and arrested” opposition activists and “disregarded” civil and political rights.The Belarusian government later took steps that Europe and the United States saw as signs of a democratic transition. Those included the release of political prisoners in August 2015. The U.S. and EU eased Belarus sanctions in October 2015, with the U.S. Treasury Department issuing a general license authorizing transactions with certain Belarusian entities. Since then, the U.S. has renewed the general license annually.However, in and around Belarus’ August 2020 presidential elections, Alexander Lukashenko, the nation’s sole leader since 1994, tightened his grip on the country in the face of a popular uprising in support of the political opposition.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin.In January, Human Rights Watch Europe director Hugh Williamson said: “In the past year, the Belarusian government shattered its own horrendous record for brutality and repression and spared no effort to shut down dissent in nearly every layer of society.”In March, Amnesty International called for an “urgent international response” to stop authorities in Belarus from further depriving the rights of its people. “Solidarity with the Belarusian people requires firm, targeted action from the international community,” the London-based human rights group said.As Polygraph.info previously reported, Lukashenko, who relies heavily on Russian President Vladimir Putin for support, has been prosecuting political rivals, most of whom are either in jail or in exile.;https://www.rferl.org/a/us-revokes-license-for-belarus-state-companies-/31212151.html,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2007/11/19/E7-22559/additional-designations-of-entities-pursuant-to-executive-order-13405,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/belarus_gl2h.pdf,http://bntd.by/en/,http://www.belneftekhim.by/en/,https://www.state.gov/revocation-of-the-authorization-of-belarus-general-license-2g-due-to-human-rights-violations-and-abuses/,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2006/06/20/06-5592/blocking-property-of-certain-persons-undermining-democratic-processes-or-institutions-in-belarus,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/c/19395.pdf,https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/files/download/publications/eu-and-us-take-actions-to-ease-belarus-sanctions.pdf,https://www.rferl.org/a/elections-in-belarus-how-lukashenka-won-and-won-and-won-and-won-and-won-/30767860.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/13/belarus-unprecedented-crackdown#,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/03/belarus-governments-threats-and-history-of-crackdown-on-protesters-require-urgent-international-response/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-lukasheko-belarus-nato-blitzkrieg/31076721.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/belarus-lukashenko-fact-check/30755492.html;Belarus Distorts U.S. Message, Ignores Repression Record;;;;;;
203;;;;Unsubstantiated;Andrei Kelin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-uk-amb-navalny/6742913.html;No Proof: Russia’s UK Ambassador Says Navalny Faking Illness;2021-04-20;polygraph;;In a BBC interview recorded on April 16 and broadcast on April 18, Russia’s ambassador to the U.K. Andrei Kelin answered questions about the political environment around Alexey Navalny, and his health while incarcerated.Kelin denied any political motive behind a Moscow court’s decision in February that sentenced Navalny, a prominent Kremlin critic, to 2.5 years in prison.“The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the charges against him for money laundering, are, they say, arbitrary and unfair. Isn’t it true that he is in prison because he is a threat to President Putin for democratic reasons?” the BBC host, Andrew Marr asked.“No, not at all. He has violated his terms of parole, and that is why he has given a sentence,” Kelin answered, reiterating Russia’s official position.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, however, the Russian court ruled as a parole violation the time Navalny spent in Germany recovering from an alleged state-ordered poisoning with a military grade nerve agent.In mid-March, Navalny said he was suffering from severe back pain and needed medical help, but the prison administration did not allow independent doctors to examine him. On March 31 Navalny said he was going on a hunger strike until given proper medical care.On April 13, Navalny’s wife Yulia posted on Instagram that she was allowed to visit her husband but could only speak with him by phone with a glass wall between them. She said he was in a good mood but was at times too weak to hold the receiver and had to take breaks to put the phone and his head on the table and rest.Answering the BBC’s questions about Navalny’s health, Kelin said: “Navalny will not be allowed to die in prison.” He then continued with series of false or misleading comments.“Mr. Navalny is behaving like a hooligan, absolutely, in trying to violate every rule that has been established,” the Russian ambassador said. “His whole purpose is to attract attention. Today his left hand is sick, tomorrow his leg is sick and all that stuff.“Navalny has been treated in the hospital, which lies not so far from the place where he is serving his sentence, and, as I understand he does not complain anymore about his pains.”The claim that Navalny does “not complain anymore” is false.According to a Reuters report on April 16 – the same day the BBC interview was recorded – Navalny’s health continued to “seriously deteriorate,” and the prison administration threatened to force feed him.On April 17, Navalny’s physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin posted on Facebook a copy of what he said were the results of a blood test from April 15. Ashikhmin said the test revealed very high levels of potassium and creatinine, putting Navalny at risk of a heart attack and kidney failure. Ashikhmin added that Navalny “could die at any moment.”On April 19, the Russian penitentiary system authority announced that Navalny, who is still on a hunger strike, had been transferred to a hospital in a prison near the city of Vladimir, about 120 miles east of Moscow. It said his condition was “satisfactory” and he had agreed to vitamin treatment.Reuters reported that the prison hospital IK-3 where Navalny was transferred was built in 1964 to treat inmates suffering from drug and alcohol addiction. An inspection in March 2020 found that the hospital lacked necessary drugs and that equipment was in a “malfunctioning state.” The hospital treats convicts with tuberculosis and psychiatric disorders.Navalny’s associates and supporters called for nationwide rallies to “save Navalny” on April 28, the same day Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual address to the nation. Russian authorities have warned citizens against joining the protests.On April 19, Moscow City Court accepted a request from the Moscow prosecutor’s office to have three organizations associated with Navalny labeled as extremist. They are the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), the Citizens’ Rights Protection Foundation, and Navalny’s regional headquarters.The court order, posted on Twitter by Navalny’s team, said that the materials in the case have been classified as “state secrets” and would only be accessible to special lawyers.Navalny’s FBK has continued publishing investigations during his time in prison. They include the video investigation “Putin’s Palace,” which was released on YouTube on January 19 and has been viewed over 116 million times. Another video investigation, “Secrets of Putin’s Valdai Dacha,” was published on April 15 and has been viewed more than 5 million times.The United States and European countries have warned Russia of “consequences” if Navalny is not provided adequate medical treatment.;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-56792529,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56102257,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-navalny-jail/31086549.html,https://twitter.com/navalny/status/1377274773592551424?s=20,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNm-iqxlHjL/?igshid=17r37lgacw9nl,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-critic-navalny-says-prison-staff-threatening-force-feed-him-imminently-2021-04-16/?taid=6079ac565a08ec000131f343&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161050959593975&set=a.10151395611793975,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/18/988437875/putin-critic-alexei-navalny-could-die-at-any-moment-doctor-says,https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-hunger-strike-3rd-week-hospital-russia-3dfcedebc76e0f2acbf8e824832fd8f9,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-we-know-about-prison-hospital-where-alexei-navalny-has-been-sent-2021-04-19/,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/daughter-jailed-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-says-he-needs-doctor-2021-04-18/,https://twitter.com/ioannZH/status/1384157238424604682,https://youtu.be/Cs1b5qvCZ54,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/white-house-says-there-will-be-consequences-if-kremlin-critic-navalny-dies-2021-04-18/;No Proof: Russia’s UK Ambassador Says Navalny Faking Illness;;;;;;

The event focused on countering “international anti-China forces” and allegations of mass incarceration, forced labor and genocide of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in northwestern China.Xu Guixiang, the regional government spokesperson, challenged the veracity of foreign databases and “so-called ‘witness testimonies’ ” used to document alleged crimes against humanity by the Chinese.One of those databases is the ""Xinjiang Data Project,” established by the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy (ASPI). Xu accused ASPI of spreading rumors to “demonize China … under the cloak of ‘academia’.” He attacked the institute’s use of satellite imagery to document Xinjiang’s multitiered detention network.“[The] ‘map section’ of the project claims that through satellite imagery and night lighting technology research methods, it has identified and mastered the geographic information of 380 so-called ‘detention facilities’ in Xinjiang,” Xu said.“However, after verification, among the so-called 380 ‘detention facilities’, 343 points (90%) are regular schools, government agencies and institutions, hospitals, residences, shops, etc. It can be seen that the project library is so fake that it has no [substance] and is hysterical.”The assertion that ASPI’s database is fabricated is false.Danielle Cave, deputy director of ASPI’s International Cyber Policy Center, told Polygraph.info: “The Chinese government does not have a strong track record in presenting facts, particularly on this issue.”She added that ASPI assesses claims about its work when “credible feedback” is given. “We believe our multi-source evidence base and the quality of our research on this topic speaks for itself,” Cave said.Regarding the camp network, Cave said ASPI’s database has now been updated to show 385 detention sites, with 11 being added and six being removed. Of the removed sites, four were duplicates (where a facility had inadvertently been marked twice) and two were no longer believed to be functioning as detention centers.ASPI notes that its years-long process of identifying the network involved collating satellite imagery, construction tenders and other government documents, previous reports on facilities, and witness accounts from journalists and others.The organization says it only counts “re-education camps, detention centers and prisons that were newly built or significantly expanded since 2017,” and that this represents “the majority of all detention facilities in Xinjiang.”ASPI notes that several features help determine higher- or lower-security facilities. Telltale signs of the former include “a combination of walls, watchtowers and barbed‑wire fencing,” among other “identical distinguishing architectural features.”According to ASPI, lesser-security facilities can look “similar to public facilities such as schools or hospitals,” although the detention facilities are still distinguishable through barbed-wire fencing “that cages individual buildings,” along with features like wire “tunnels” that restrict detainee access and movement.A Chinese police officer takes his position by the road near what is officially called a vocational education center in Yining, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China on September 4, 2018.ASPI says that external barbed-wire fencing has been removed from many camps since 2019, although “highly securitized infrastructure,” including internalized barbed-wire fences, external walls and watchtowers, remains.Other giveaways include a lack of cars and the absence of people in satellite images.While Xu claimed that 343 of the sites are schools and other facilities, ASPI documents the repurposing of schools and public buildings to form part of the camp network.For example, ASPI notes that as China’s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims ramped up in 2017, a school in Kashgar city “was converted into a large scale re-education facility.” ASPI believes that facility may have been “decommissioned” after being “sanitized” and used in propaganda reports.In 2018, The Wall Street Journal located one such camp just south of Kashgar, describing it as “having the look and scale of a full-size prison.”A former detainee told the Journal the facility he was locked up in looked like “a school” covering a “vast area.”He described intensive communist indoctrination sessions, in which detainees would watch films and sing propaganda songs for hours a day.The “night lighting technology” Xu mentions refers to the examination of night‑time satellite imagery to determine the location of “newly illuminated areas.” Those “newly illuminated areas” are suggestive of newly-built detention facilities and corresponding highway checkpoints to monitor people’s movements across Xinjiang.ASPI said those images “were cross‑referenced against high‑resolution daytime satellite imagery that showed much greater detail.”China previously denied the facilities existed. However, in 2018, responding to a growing body of evidence and international condemnation, a senior regional official described the detention facilities as “people-oriented” vocational institutes and schools.At that time, authorities had just legalized the use of such facilities to counter religious extremism in what China scholar James Leibold called a “retrospective justification” for the detention program, German news broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Associated Press.China claims the facilities were opened in response to years of separatist unrest, culminating in the May 2014 Urumqi suicide attacks, which reportedly left 43 people dead and dozens of others wounded.Officials say the goal is to stamp out extremism and alleviate poverty by providing vocational training and jobs. Chinese state media have cited detainees who ""cherished"" the opportunity to attend the facilities.Beijing has also lashed out at what it calls ""slanderous"" accusations of genocide in Xinjiang.Amid continuing international scrutiny and criticism, China has increasingly gone on the offensive, attacking the credibility of scholars, witnesses, leaked Chinese documents and other reports. Beijing further shields Xinjiang from investigation by using a highly controlled media environment that complicates verification efforts.Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Polygraph.info in 2018 that Chinese journalists knew to “steer clear” of Xinjiang, while foreign journalists were “heavily surveilled if they set foot in the region, making reporting very difficult.”Recent examples of verification issues faced by journalists include a BBC report documenting the purported destruction of a mosque and a Bloomberg report attempting to verify allegations of coerced labor at solar industry facilities.A Vice News report from Xinjiang documented repeated attempts by police to prevent simple street interviews and filming in non-sensitive locations.Wang said Beijing could easily clear its name by allowing United Nations investigators, journalists and rights groups “unfettered access to the region” to see the facilities for themselves.";https://cdn.xjdp.aspi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/25125443/documenting-xinjiangs-detention-system.cleaned.pdf,https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/exploring-xinjiangs-detention-facilities/,https://cdn.xjdp.aspi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/25125443/documenting-xinjiangs-detention-system.cleaned.pdf,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/09/china-massive-crackdown-muslim-region#,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/16/c_137535821.htm,https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-xinjiang-region-legalizes-muslim-internment-camps/a-45837413,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/16/c_137535942.htm,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights/china-rejects-genocide-charge-in-xinjiang-says-door-open-to-u-n-idUSKBN2AM1UX,https://www.dw.com/en/china-extreme-brainwashing-at-uighur-prison-camps-exposed-in-new-leak/a-51394542,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/under-pressure-over-xinjiang-china-093951141.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-xinjiang-internment-camp-propaganda-fact-check-/29553362.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DewWSGTwOXo,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-04-13/the-solar-industry-s-xinjiang-problem-video;China Falsely Attacks Aussie Think Tank Documenting Uyghur Persecution;;;;;;
205;;;;False;Eduardo Bolsonaro;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-bolsonaro-son-covers-for-agribusiness-on-amazon-deforestation/6742897.html;Bolsonaro's Son Covers for Agribusiness on Worsening Amazon Deforestation;2021-04-09;polygraph;;"On April 3, Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s sons and a lawmaker, tweeted that “Brazilian agribusiness does not deforest the Amazon, it generates clean energy and helps to conserve the forest that occupies 61% of Brazil's territory.” An accompanying video reported that 46% of Brazil's “energy matrix” is from renewable sources – hydroelectricity, solar, wind and bioenergy – three times higher than the rest of the world. The video also claimed that ""70% of all renewable energy comes from rural areas."" Although the video’s 46 percent figure is accurate, Eduardo Bolsonaro's claim that agribusiness doesn't cause deforestation in the Amazon is false. Moreover, the assertion that the Amazon occupies 61% of Brazil’s area is slightly exaggerated. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) says the Amazon’s area is just above 5 million square kilometers (1.9 million square miles), or 59% of the country's territory.  A tract of the Amazon jungle burns as it is cleared by loggers and farmers in Porto Velho on August 24, 2019.  Deforestation in the Amazon is directly linked to the demand for commodities and economic growth in the region. Before the 1970s, the rainforest occupied 4 million square kilometers; it is now 20% smaller. In the early 2000s, Brazil launched a plan to fight deforestation with increased oversight and monthly satellite monitoring. Between 2005 and 2012, the country was able to grow its agribusiness sector without increasing Amazon deforestation. But deforestation began to increase in 2013 under a new, less rigorous forestry code. Between August 2018 and July 2019, the size of the deforested area in the Amazon exceeded 10,000 square kilometers – the highest pace of deforestation in 11 years. The following year (August 2019 to July 2020), deforestation increased to more than 11,000 square kilometers. Part of Brazil’s deforestation is the result of legal development. The forestry code requires the preservation of 80% of the original forest on properties within the Amazon (meaning only 20% of a farmer's property can be deforested). But most of the deforestation is a result of illegal development. In 2019, 99% of deforestation was not authorized or happened in areas that were on indigenous lands or otherwise protected. Multiple reports and studies have shown how agriculture, especially cattle and soybean production, is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation in Brazil. From 1985 to 2018, Brazil lost 890,000 square kilometers of natural forests (an area greater than Spain and Germany combined). During the same period, the area designated for agriculture and livestock increased by 860,000 square kilometers, the Brazilian newspaper Globo reported, based on satellite and geoprocessing data by MapBiomas, an initiative of Brazil's Climate Observatory.MapBiomas also partnered with the Amazonian Georeferenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG) – a consortium of civil society organizations from countries that have Amazon rainforest (including Columbia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia). A report in 2020 which showed that agribusiness was responsible for 84% of deforestation in the Amazon concluded: ""Consequently, the pace of transformation of these areas follows a pattern similar to that of deforestation."" A 2019 study by Chain Reaction Research (CRR), a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, also singled out agriculture as a culprit in deforestation. It found that ""the large number of fires in Brazil was not only related to clearing new land for agricultural purposes. Farmers also set fires to clear and maintain areas for new pastures for cattle grazing and remove any excess vegetation."" In July 2020, Science Magazine published a peer-reviewed study that addressed the link between illegal deforestation and European Union imports of Brazil's beef and soy. The authors found that ""2% of properties are responsible for 62% of all potentially illegal deforestation and that roughly 20% of soy exports and at least 17% of beef exports from both biomes to the EU may be contaminated with illegal deforestation."" And despite a Soy Moratorium signed in 2006, under which companies agreed to not buy soy grown in deforested areas in the rainforest, the authors found that even farmers in compliance ""are clearing the forest for pasture or other crops within their holdings, and hence are still profiting from deforestation.""   A herd of cattle at a farm in Ruropolis, Para state, on September 5, 2019. The supply chain of the beef sector allows deforestation to happen without the direct involvement of large agro-industrial conglomerates. The conservation publication Mongabay pointed to ""cattle born in deforested areas [by grileiros, or land grabbers] blacklisted by IBAMA, Brazil’s federal environmental enforcement agency, which are then sold to small and medium-sized farms. After fattening, they are legally purchased by large meatpackers."" Trase (Transparency for Sustainable Economies), a supply chain transparency initiative, analyzed beef, offal, and live cattle exports during 2015-2017, and mapped ""the supply chains of Brazilian beef and live cattle exports from the municipalities where cattle are raised through to the importing countries"" along with deforestation alerts in those regions. Trase estimated that 2,100 square kilometers of deforestation between those years – an area larger than London – were linked to exports. Of those exports, 38% went to Hong Kong and mainland China. Investigations by Brazil’s federal public ministry (MPF) have shown links between the beef sector and land grabbing, fires and deforestation.   Indigenous people from the Mura tribe show a deforested area in unmarked indigenous lands, inside the Amazon rainforest, on August 20, 2019. Experts have blamed President Bolsonaro’s pro-agribusiness rhetoric and his cabinet's actions to weaken environmental agencies for the increase in deforestation. During a campaign visit to the state of Rondonia in 2018, Bolsonaro said: ""[I]t's absurd what is done in Brazil using the name of the environment. We have an area larger than the southeastern region [of Brazil] demarcated as an indigenous land, and this has inhibited those who want to invest in agribusiness and even family farming.

206;;;;Misleading;Dmitry Peskov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/6742895.html;Fake News About Ukraine Conflict? ‘Hard to Imagine,’ Kremlin Says;2021-04-08;polygraph;;"On April 5, journalists asked Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov about reports that a Ukrainian military drone caused an explosion in Donbas that killed a 5-year-old child. The report emerged from social media channels operated by Russian proxies who control eastern Ukraine along the Russian border. A variety of pro-Moscow media outlets in Russia and Ukraine quickly picked up the story. On April 5, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was opening a case. That is despite the fact that the incident in question purportedly took place in a foreign country where Russian law enforcement has no authority.Russia denies any involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine despite overwhelming evidence that it supports separatist rebels and their self-proclaimed republics in the area. Peskov told reporters:""I don’t have verified information about the child’s death. However, I see no reason to question the reports that came from the self-proclaimed republics ... It’s certainly hard to imagine someone spreading fake news about the death of a child."" This is misleading: In fact, there are good reasons to question the news from Russia’s proxies in Donbas and Russian state media, since they have an established record of coordinating and fabricating false news, including disinformation that involves children.First, there is the unsubstantiated case at hand – a 5-year-old allegedly killed by a Ukrainian drone. Although the story gained rapid traction in Russian social and state media, authorities of the rebel-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR) released no names or personal details of the child or its family.Initially, some sources reported that the incident happened in Oleksandrivka, a town near the front lines. However, the location later changed to another settlement called Oleksandrivske, and this became the official version given by the DNR authorities, as well as the Russian Investigative Committee.This time, DNR and Russia’s investigators provided specific information about the incident – a home address in the town of Oleksandrivske, 2nd Dorozhnaya Street, 36. However, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM), which observes and records casualty incidents in eastern Ukraine on daily basis, did not report any such incident until April 6.“On 2 April in Donetsk region (part of Donbas), a child died due to blast trauma and shrapnel wounds in non-government-controlled Oleksandrivske; and a man was injured due to shelling in government-controlled Krasnohorivka,” the OSCE SMM​ report stated.Yet nothing in the report suggests the child was killed as a result of combat activity.The choice of Oleksandrivske is significant because that town is approximately 30 kilometers from the front line. This puts it out of range for the type of makeshift attack drones used by both sides in the conflict – i.e., civilian drones modified to drop small explosive munitions or grenades.Social media chatter from the territory reported that a child had been killed by an explosion, though not from a Ukrainian drone. On the Russian social networking site VK, a user named Valentina Iskritskaya responded to the story in a pro-DNR group chat:“Yes, it happened yesterday, but not because of a drone. I am from this village. The owner had a mine, and his grandson found it. I do not understand why people are lied to. My condolences.”Another VK user also said the victim's parents live in a nearby village and said their child was killed by a mine his grandfather had kept in the yard since 2014 or 2015, or early in the war.In this case, ""mine” could refer to a land mine or a mortar shell.The Ukrainian volunteer counter-disinformation organization StopFake reported that it reached a person who has relatives in the village of Oleksandrivske. According to StopFake, the story the story matched the account in Iskritskaya’s VK comment: A man had collected and kept at home some kind of ammunition, and it exploded.StopFake also found that pro-Russian sources circulated a misattributed photo that purportedly showed the victim. The child in the photo is clearly younger than five years old; a search revealed the photo is from 2014 and shows Ivan Yermilov, who, along with his father Vladimir, was killed in July 2014 by an artillery round that hit their house during fighting near Kramatorsk.On April 6, Russian war correspondent Alexander Kots wrote about the latest incident for the Moscow tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. He said the child who was killed in the blast was named Vladislav Shikhov and was four years old, not five years old. Kots' story included photos of a boy that do not match the photos of Ivan Yermilov circulated on social media.Kots offered no evidence to support claims that Shikhov was killed by a drone strike. He attempted to rebut claims that a drone could not have flown 30 kilometers behind the front lines, pointing out that rebels in Syria have used homemade drones that reportedly can travel much further. However, such drones are not known to be in use in the Donbas conflict. As for Peskov’s inability to imagine fake news about the death of a child, no imagination is necessary. There have been two high-profile cases in which Russia’s proxies, aided by Russian state media, invented children who were purportedly killed by Ukrainian forces.The most infamous of these was in the summer of 2014, after Ukrainian forces captured territory from Russian proxy forces. Russian state media interviewed an alleged “refugee” who claimed to have witnessed Ukrainian soldiers kill a mother and crucify her son.In 2015, pro-Russian and Russian state media reported that Ukrainian shelling had killed a 10-year-old girl near Donetsk. A BBC reporter attempted to track down details about the girl (again, no names were given), and was unable to find anyone in the town where the incident allegedly occurred who knew anything about it or the putative victim. The local morgue said it had not received a body. A member of a TV crew that reported the girl's death admitted to the BBC that the girl didn’t exist, with another crew member saying: “We had to broadcast it.” Peskov’s comment comes against a background of rising military tensions in the region as Russia builds up its forces in Crimea and along Ukraine’s borders. As a result, the U.S. military’s command in Europe has raised its alert status to its highest level.";https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1554328/,https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-a-child-died-in-donbas-as-a-result-of-a-ukrainian-drone-attack/,http://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/482927,https://www.rferl.org/a/deadly-diy-drones-in-the-donbas/30445714.html,https://vk.com/wall-5158073_2193466?w=wall-5158073_2193466_r2193763,https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-a-child-died-in-donbas-as-a-result-of-a-ukrainian-drone-attack/,https://www.unicef.org/media/media_81398.html,http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/rolling_news_russian/2014/07/140703_ru_n_railways_died_staff,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27261/4393758/,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/01/12/the_poor_mans_airforce/,https://www.thedailybeast.com/theres-no-evidence-the-ukrainian-army-crucified-a-child-in-slovyansk,https://euvsdisinfo.eu/anniversary-the-crucified-boy-turns-two/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/08/russian-media-fabricated-story-about-a-child-getting-killed-by-ukrainian-shelling-the-bbc-says/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-fact-check-as-military-tensions-rise-mythical-russian-aggression-is-very-real-in-ukraine-/31182288.html;Fake News About Ukraine Conflict? ‘Hard to Imagine,’ Kremlin Says;;;;;;

New cases exceeded 10,000 the following day.Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been accused of mishandling the pandemic, with critics alleging he rolled out vaccines too slowly. Estimates suggest less than 1% of the country’s 110 million people have been vaccinated.That has led some to seek alternative treatments.On April 5, Philippine Congressman Mike Defensor announced on Facebook that he would distribute the antiparasitic drug ivermectin for COVID-19. He said the drug will be offered free of charge to residents of Quezon City, in the National Capitol Region, who do not have access to vaccines.Defensor contracted COVID-19 and claims ivermectin aided in his recovery. Late last month, he called on the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow ivermectin prescriptions to treat the virus.Representative Enrico Pineda also supports using ivermectin to treat COVID-19.He filed a resolution with the Philippines’ House of Representatives calling on the country’s FDA to explain why it ruled against the use of ivermectin as a coronavirus treatment.Pineda said clinical trials in many countries had shown ivermectin aids in the battle against COVID-19 when used in conjunction with vitamins and other supplements.Defensor also filed a resolution supporting the use of ivermectin to combat COVID-19.On April 2, Pineda’s son Enzo, an actor with more than 668,000 Twitter followers, tweeted out support for his father’s actions.“Proud of my dad for spearheading the approval of ivermectin as an affordable drug to fight covid-19,” Pineda wrote. “I have friends who recently recovered from the virus who can testify that the drug works and I’m also using it now as a preventative medicine.”However, claims that ivermectin is an effective treatment against COVID-19 are unsubstantiated, and health watchdogs have warned against off-label use of ivermectin, saying it could be harmful.According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug used to treat tropical diseases, including onchocerciasis, helminthiases and scabies. It can also be used to prevent heartworm disease in some animal species, as well as treat internal and external parasites.On April 5, a Philippines presidential spokesman issued a statement denying Duterte had ordered the country’s health agency to authorize the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19.On April 7, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced that giving away ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 violates a law against distributing and promoting unregistered pharmaceuticals.The Philippines FDA also issued an advisory against purchasing ivermectin veterinary products for use against COVID-19, noting that ivermectin products “for human use are in topical formulations under prescription use only.” It added that drugs for specific species of animals “are often highly concentrated and can be highly toxic to humans.”A devotee offers prayers outside the Quiapo church on Good Friday, April 2, 2021, as the government implements a strict lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Manila.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 in clinical trials, adding that the evidence it is an effective COVID-19 cure is “inconclusive.” A guideline development group of international panel of experts is looking into the ivermectin’s effectiveness against COVID-19.Reviewing data from 16 randomized trials, the group found: “[T]he evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of very low certainty, due to the small sizes and methodological limitations of available trial data, including small number of events.”Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO representative to the Philippines, reinforced that position during an April 5 news conference, saying that “ivermectin has not proven efficacy against COVID-19. Even if we look at it from a preventive perspective, [there is] no evidence that supports it.”He also pushed back against anecdotal reports, saying that the efficacy of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 must be evaluated through clinical trials.“More than 95% of [COVID-19 patients] recovered without specific treatments. So if you give those patients a particular drug and see that that drug cure them, that is not science; that is not evidence. And this is what is happening again with, possibly, ivermectin,” Abeyasinghe said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned against using ivermectin to treat COVID-19, saying it “has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19.”The European Union’s European Medicines Agency (EMA), which evaluates and supervises medicinal products, has likewise found that using ivermectin to prevent and treat COVID-19 is currently not suitable outside of “well-designed clinical trials.”The EMA said clinical trial results have been mixed, “with some studies showing no benefit and others reporting a potential benefit.”";https://apnews.com/article/philippines-coronavirus-pandemic-asia-manila-asia-pacific-d3b285586e283eb9c682b353047f4649,https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/ph,https://www.rappler.com/nation/coronavirus-cases-philippines-april-3-2021,https://www.rappler.com/nation/highlights-house-hearing-duterte-government-mishandling-pandemic,https://interaksyon.philstar.com/politics-issues/2021/04/05/189030/philippines-vaccination-ranks-3rd-in-southeast-asia-pcoo-shows-partial-data/,https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2021/03/31/let-doctors-prescribe-ivermectin-solon-urges-fda/,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1135248,https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/,https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fda-letter-stakeholders-do-not-use-ivermectin-intended-animals-treatment-covid-19-humans,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1135830,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/04/07/2089529/doh-distribution-promotion-ivermectin-violate-law-vs-unregistered-drugs,https://www.fda.gov.ph/fda-advisory-no-2021-0526-public-health-warning-on-the-purchase-and-use-of-ivermectin-veterinary-products-for-covid-19/,https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-advises-that-ivermectin-only-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-within-clinical-trials,https://pia.gov.ph/news/articles/1071555,https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-advises-against-use-ivermectin-prevention-treatment-covid-19-outside-randomised-clinical-trials;Prominent Filipinos Tout Unproven Parasite Drug for COVID-19;;;;;;
208;;;;Misleading;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-discrimination-russia/6742892.html;Putin’s Blind Eye on Russia’s Ethnic Strife;2021-04-07;polygraph;;"President Vladimir Putin has vowed not to allow foreign ethnic conflicts to be imported to Russia. His pledge came during a March 30 briefing Putin received from Nikolai Patrushev, director of Russia’s Security Council, a Kremlin advisory body.According to the RIA Novosti state news agency, Patrushev addressed “Western attempts to impose on Russia alien values and norms” that threaten the country’s political stability, specifically when it comes to ethnicity and religion. Patrushev recommended that Russia fight against such actions.In response, Putin said ethnic and religious identity is an “extremely sensitive matter” and must be treated with “delicate and tactful actions.”“We in Russia must not allow, will not allow any aggressive, disrespectful demonstration of one's ethnicity towards the representatives of any nationality,” he said, “nor will we allow any foreign conflicts of this kind to be transferred to our land.”The statement is misleading: In fact, Russia is notorious for discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, and its decades-long record in this regard has been well documented.Russia has an extremism law criminalizing any incitement of ethnic and religious hatred. However, as the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has shown year after year in its annual reports, this law has more often been used to prosecute and punish members of ethnic and religious minorities than to support and protect them.As Polygraph.info and others have reported, Russia’s extremism law has been used to prosecute Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormons.Prosecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia – a still from the documentary The Last Judgment.“No steps have been taken to adopt comprehensive civil and administrative legislation against discrimination,” the ECRI reported in 2019. It also noted that “[s]ignificant amounts of racist hate speech are expressed by politicians and religious leaders” and that such “[i]ntolerant public discourse remains unchallenged and unpunished.”The ECRI report also stated that “[r]acial profiling has not been defined and prohibited by law,” and that its use by Russian police continued to be “widespread, manifested in arbitrary identity checks and unnecessary arrests, targeting in particular migrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well as Roma.”Georgians and Ukrainians in Russia have also been the victims of intolerance and government-led discrimination due to Moscow’s political and military interventions in their countries.Russia is home to nearly 70 ethnic groups, with ethnic Russians the largest group and recognized in the country’s constitution as the predominant one. Putin personally proposed constitutional reforms in March 2020 that enhance Russian ethnicity and Russian Orthodox Church dominance in the country’s law; Russia’s parliament promptly approved.“Immigrants and ethnic minorities — particularly those who appear to be from the Caucasus or Central Asia — face governmental and societal discrimination and harassment. Constitutional amendments establish the primacy of the Russian language within the state, favoring by implication ethnic Russians,” the rights group Freedom House wrote in its 2021 report on Russia.Patrushev’s warning about alleged “Western attempts to impose on Russia alien values and norms” when it comes to ethnicity and religion echoes Russian media criticism of last summer’s removal of a colonial monument near the Black Sea city of Sochi at the demand of ethnic Circassians. It also echoes last month’s protest by ethnic Tatars against statues of Yermak, the Russian conqueror of Siberia. Russian commentators have condemned these actions as “Russian BLM” – a reference to the Black Lives Matter protest movement in the United States.Action to mark the sixth anniversary of the annexation of Crimea at the Kalanchak checkpoint of entry and exit in Ukraine's Kherson Region, March 3, 2020.Many in Russia, including government officials, reacted to last year’s BLM protests with racist slurs and mockery of U.S. authorities’ inability to suppress the movement.The monument near Sochi was dedicated to the Russian soldiers who died fighting against the Circassians during Russia’s conquest of the Caucasus in 18th and 19th centuries. The city removed it soon after it was erected, following protests by Circassians. Russian politicians and celebrities criticized the Sochi city administration for “failing” to honor their forefathers’ legacy and “insulting the Russian nation.”Russian media repeatedly described the incident as “importing the American BLM to Russia.”The Tatars are a large ethnic minority in Russia and even have their own republic inside the country. They have played a prominent role in modern European politics as natives of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.The Circassians, on the other hand, are what scholars call a “hidden nation.”As an ethnic group native to the North Caucasus, the Circassians fought Russian colonization for more than 100 years and were nearly wiped out by Tsarist Russia in late 19th century. More than third of the Circassians were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire.Members of the Circassian diaspora in the United States rally in New York City on May 21, 2014. Photo by the Circassian Cultural Institute, New Jersey.Today, their descendants live divided between three southern Russian regions and struggle to preserve their identity and culture. The Circassians also suffer from the trauma of centuries-long slavery under the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere in the Middle East and Africa.In Russia, the government seems to perceive the Circassians' struggle to preserve their identity as a threat and responds pre-emptively. Prominent Circassians are frequently detained, arrested and prosecuted on bogus charges, or for participating in peaceful parades and rallies on Circassian Memorial Day in May, or for hosting traditional prayer under a tulip tree, sacred to the Circassians.";https://ria.ru/20210323/ekspansiya-1602536270.html,https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-the-russian-federation/1680934a91,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-extremism-jehovah-witnesses-ban/28421009.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/religious-freedom-liberal-governments-fact-check/30048290.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-detains-american-mormons/29815450.html,https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-the-russian-federation/1680934a91,https://eurasianet.org/kyrgyzstan-president-demands-russians-respect-his-countrymen,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/13/AR2010121305794.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/world/europe/07moscow.html,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/02/03/2020/5e5d010e9a794718c0f57783,https://freedomhouse.org/country/russia/freedom-world/2021#CL,https://news.ru/investigations/blm-po-russki-kak-v-rossii-boryutsya-s-pamyatnikami-belym-lyudyam/,https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2021/03/31/tatarskoe-i-cherkesskoe-podrazhanie-blm-kak-bomba-pod-rossiey-mnenie,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-george-floyd-protests/30653379.html,https://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/52181/,https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2021/03/31/tatarskoe-i-cherkesskoe-podrazhanie-blm-kak-bomba-pod-rossiey-mnenie,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-hidden-past-of-sochi,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circassian,https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/151025,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/303023/,https://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/47602/,https://oc-media.org/circassian-activist-martin-kochesoko-charged-again/,https://oc-media.org/hunger-striking-circassian-leader-suffers-stroke/;Putin’s Blind Eye on Russia’s Ethnic Strife;;;;;;
209;;;;False;Hua Chunying;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-who-covid-lab/6742889.html;China Sidesteps WHO Chief on Coronavirus Origins with Anti-US Disinfo;2021-04-05;polygraph;;"This fact check has been corrected. On March 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a Global Study of the Origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A joint China-WHO team conducted that study in Wuhan, China, in January-February 2021.The report said no firm conclusion could be drawn about what role the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, to which many early cases were traced, played in the origin of the outbreak, or how the virus was introduced there.The original source of viral transmission to humans also remains unknown.Still, WHO Director-General Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while the team had visited several laboratories in Wuhan to determine whether “the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident,” their assessment was “not extensive enough.”“Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,” Ghebreyesus said. “Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy.”He added: “Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table.”China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying was asked about Ghebreyesus’ comments during a March 31 press conference.She said that “there is always a question mark over lab leak,” adding that there had been reports of early outbreaks across the world.“In addition to Fort Detrick, [a] certain country has more than 200 biological bases around the world,” Hua said. “So, I think, if necessary, scientists should be allowed to work in a scientific spirit with relevant laboratories around the world.”Laboratory scientist Andrea Luquette cultures coronavirus to prepare for testing at U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, on March 19, 2020.The previous day, she more directly insinuated that the U.S. Army lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland, was the source of the pandemic.“If you think about it, since the outbreak of COVID-19, how many lies and rumors and lies against China have been told by certain politicians, leaders and lawmakers in the US and Europe, including those about China's lab leak and making of the virus? I wonder how many of those lies you have checked? Besides, there is still a big question mark over the lab at Fort Detrick,” she said.That is false. Chinese state media and officials have repeatedly floated conspiracy theories or promoted unfounded vectors of infection like cold chain storage to deflect claims that China was the source of the pandemic.Polygraph.info has previously debunked conspiracy theories involving Fort Detrick, which typically rely on anonymous “netizens” and non-existing reports as sources.In July 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered that the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick be shut down over safety concerns, saying it did not have “sufficient systems in place to decontaminate wastewater.”The biodefense center was studying germs and toxins “that could be used to threaten the military or public health,” and was also investigating “disease outbreaks,” The New York Times reported. The “select agents” being studied at the center included Ebola, smallpox, anthrax and plague, and the poison ricin.However, according to media reports, nobody was exposed, and nothing leaked outside the facility, which was fully reopened in March 2020.Likewise, no evidence has been put forward linking Fort Detrick to the coronavirus outbreak.After analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, a team of scientists led by immunology and microbiology researcher Kristian Anderson determined that SARS-CoV-2 is of natural origin.“Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,” the team wrote.People practice social distancing as they line up for a second round of citywide coronavirus testing at a residential compound following new COVID-19 cases in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, on Jan. 12, 2021.Beijing earlier pushed the conspiracy theory that infected U.S. soldiers could have brought the virus to Wuhan.China has also been the target of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 was engineered in a Chinese biological weapons laboratory.U.S. officials, and others have posited that the virus was potentially leaked from a Chinese lab, or the product of ""gain of function"" research, which involves modifying the genomes of viruses.Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance and a member of the WHO delegation, told NPR in March that wildlife farms in southern China are the most likely source of the pandemic.He said evidence had shown that these farms, which the government shut down in February 2020, were supplying vendors at Wuhan’s Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market.Linfa Wang, a virologist who studies bat viruses at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and a member of the WHO investigative team, told NPR there was “massive” viral transmission at the market.""In the live-animal section, they had many positive samples,"" Wang said. ""They even have two samples from which they could isolate live virus.”Daszak said authorities closed that supply-chain pathway because it was likely a route for the virus to spread to Wuhan.France’s Reporterre, a news site which covers environmental and social issues, reported in January 2021 that it was increasingly plausible COVID-19 originated in fur farms, with minks and raccoon dogs likely intermediate species.Reporterre said that China had resisted that route of inquiry to protect its $20 billion annual fur industry.Christian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and helped identify the SARS virus in 2003, told the Guardian in April 2020: “If somebody gave me a few hundred thousand bucks and free access to China to find the source of the virus, I would look in places where raccoon dogs are bred.”The Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where a number of people fell ill with COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic, sits closed in Wuhan on Jan, 21, 2020.The WHO-China joint inquiry concluded that the virus most likely originated in bats or pangolins and was passed on to another animal, from which it then spread to people.While recognizing “direct spillover from bats to humans may have occurred,” it said that “[c]andidate intermediate host species may include mink, pangolins, rabbits, raccoon dogs and domesticated cats that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 ... or species such as civets and ferret badgers and related mustelids that were shown to be infected by SARS-CoV during the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China.”The report also said it was “extremely unlikely” the pandemic originated in a laboratory but added that “laboratory accidents do happen.”Prior to China’s centralization of all COVID-19 publications in February 2020, with all research needing approval from a Chinese government-controlled task force prior to publication, two Chinese scientists speculated in a since-removed paper that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.”According to that paper, studies of horseshoe bats were conducted at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and “surgery was performed on the caged animals, and the tissue samples were collected for DNA and RNA extraction and sequencing.”It added: “The tissue samples and contaminated trashes were source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market.”The WHO report made no mention of those claims but noted that the Wuhan CDC laboratory moved on December 2, 2019, to a new location near the Huanan market. It added that “moves can be disruptive for the operations of any laboratory.”According to the joint study, the Wuhan CDC lab itself did not report “any disruptions or incidents caused by the move.” It stated that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) sequenced the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 — CoV RaTG13, which infects horseshoe bats.But it also said there “is no record of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in any laboratory before December 2019, or genomes that in combination could provide a SARS-CoV-2 genome.”In January, a U.S. State Department fact sheet said the U.S. government had “reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019 … with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.” It further charged China was conducting secret military research there. China denies those claims.Meantime, the WHO report has faced international criticism. Thirteen governments, including the United States, said in a statement on March 30 that the study had been “significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples.”The New York Times cited WHO investigators saying that Chinese scientists refused to share raw data on the initial coronavirus outbreak, and that Beijing’s unwillingness to release information was hindering efforts to prevent future outbreaks.That information included blood sample data that could potentially clarify how widely the virus circulated in China in 2019. The Times report was published in February but has since been disputed.China was also criticized for controlling which WHO investigators were allowed into the country.Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said the WHO rejected the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was manmade.

210;;;;Misleading;RT (Russia Today);;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-today-video-slams-virus-lockdowns-with-covid-19-disinfo/6742873.html;Russia Today Video Slams Virus Lockdowns with COVID-19 Disinfo;2021-03-25;polygraph;;On March 18, Reuters reported on the release of a European Union document accusing Russian state media of deploying a “significant disinformation campaign” against the West, allegedly aimed at sowing panic and mistrust about COVID-19 and governments’ responses to the pandemic, something which Moscow has fervently denied.On March 22, however, the Russian state-owned media outlet RT (Russia Today) tweeted a video that arguably supports the EU report’s conclusions. The video introduces the “RT COVID Freedom Index,” hosted by RT reporter Polly Boiko, who questions the wisdom of the lockdowns that various governments enacted to contain COVID-19. At the start of the video, she downplays the threat from the virus, implying it only kills the elderly.“First, coronavirus came for your grandparents,” she said. “And then, it came for ... Well, that was it really.”She then describes the lockdowns, and an image of barbed wire appears behind her.“Nations went into lockdown, because global pandemics were unprecedented,” she said. “Leaders could think of nothing better to do, than to lock us all in our houses, stop our kids from going to school, and shut down the pubs.”She compares the level of “freedom” in places like the U.K., with its restrictive lockdown, to Belarus and the U.S. state of Texas, where citizens are allowed to eat in restaurants.Boiko’s narrative is misleading on multiple counts. First, implying that COVID-19 only “came for” elderly people alone is wrong. While those over 65 have a higher incidence of death, younger people also are at risk and can spread the disease to vulnerable populations. In the United States alone, COVID-19 has killed approximately 543,000 people. The idea that only the elderly should fear dying from COVID-19 is just one of many widespread myths about the disease. In the United States, 20 percent of the COVID-19 cases during the summer of 2020 were young people under 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control. John Hopkins reported that younger people requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 symptoms also increased in 2020. One study showed that out of 3,000 patients aged 18 to 34, whose COVID-19 symptoms were severe enough to require hospitalization, 21 percent were in intensive care, 10 percent required respirators, and nearly 3 percent died.Through mid-March, U.S. mortality data tracked by Statista show that about 20 percent of deaths were among people younger than 65 – a toll of approximately 100,000.Moreover, there is mounting evidence of long-term effects from the coronavirus infection, including permanent organ damage. Young adults can also be at higher risk for infection because many work in service industry jobs where they are required to interact with people on a daily basis. Boiko suggests that lockdowns were the idea of national governments, implying that they could think of no other practical solutions. But quarantines, masks, social distancing and vaccinations are all tactics adopted in addition to lockdowns, which are not unprecedented. Lockdowns, quarantines, and restrictions on large social gatherings were all used during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, for example.The main purpose of lockdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic has been to reduce infection rates and thereby not overburden countries’ healthcare infrastructure. The effect of high volumes of COVID-19 patients was apparent in places like New York City, where healthcare workers suffered from a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other resources. In Russia, doctors frequently complained of shortages of equipment and faulty ventilators. There is considerable data suggesting lockdowns have been effective at reducing infection rates and may have saved millions of lives worldwide. Two studies published last June, one by Imperial College in London and another by U.S. scientists in the journal Nature, found that lockdowns along with social distancing measures did significantly slow the virus infection rate.There were outliers, however. Sweden is often upheld as an example of a nation that didn’t implement lockdowns yet compared favorably to other countries in terms of mortality and infection. However, critics of these claims point out that Sweden had a comparatively low population density and was less of an international transit hub than countries such as the U.K. Moreover, Sweden did worse than its Scandinavian neighbors in terms of COVID-19 deaths, and although it never imposed a lockdown on par with many other countries, it did institute some restrictions, such as bans on public gatherings and reduced business hours.Within the same country, lockdown procedures and policies may differ widely. The World Health Organization warned that lockdowns should not be governments’ primary method of fighting COVID-19. A handful of governments in Asia – South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong – managed to keep the virus under control without lockdown measures. They managed to do so mainly by means of effective and efficient testing, contact tracing and self-quarantining.;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation/russia-deploying-coronavirus-disinformation-to-sow-panic-in-west-eu-document-says-idUSKBN21518F,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-intelligence-coronavirus-disinformation/31146031.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-covid-19-younger-adults-are-at-risk-too,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/,https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2021/01/eight-biggest-covid-sceptic-myths-and-why-they-re-wrong,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://apnews.com/article/78d8e23fc2a819d1956e4d0a332f7618,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-lockdowns/fact-check-studies-show-covid-19-lockdowns-have-saved-lives-idUSKBN2842WS,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-lockdowns-idUSKBN23F1G3,https://www.bbc.com/news/55949640,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-12/world-health-organization-coronavirus-lockdown-advice/12753688,https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/debunking-3-myths-about-covid-19-lockdowns/;Russia Today Video Slams Virus Lockdowns with COVID-19 Disinfo;;;;;;

Teodosie told Aleph News: “There is no way he could have swallowed a 100 ml of water from the gesture I saw. He died from choking on mother’s milk. His parents overfed him.”That statement is false. Paramedics arrived and helped the infant cling to life. He died the next day in a hospital’s intensive care unit, and an autopsy found 100 milliliters (3.4 ounces) of water in his lungs. There is no evidence that he choked on mother’s milk.Orthodox archbishop Teodosie blesses worshipers during an Epiphany religious service in Constanta on Monday, January 6, 2020.Here is how local media reported the tragedy, which has sparked outrage in Romania.On Sunday, January 31, an ambulance was called to a church in the Zamka neighborhood of the northern city of Suceava. Paramedics resuscitated a six-week-old baby boy after the priest had submerged the child three times in the baptismal font, in accordance with the Orthodox Christian ritual, the local news site Objectiv said.“When the [paramedic] crew arrived at the place of worship, the newborn was in cardio-respiratory arrest and resuscitation maneuvers were needed. ‘He was intubated, aspirated, had a lot of water in his lungs,’ said the doctor who gave him first aid in shock, acknowledging that the little one was almost dead,” Objectiv reported.Another Romanian media outlet, Antena3, reported that the child had spent the night on a ventilator in the Suceava County Hospital’s intensive care unit but died early that morning. Antena3 reported that police have launched a criminal investigation and that the priest who performed the baptism was charged with manslaughter.The priest has denied wrongdoing. But Ioan Bulboaca, a lawyer for the child’s parents, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: ""The child was crying; he was put in the font with his face up, anyone would swallow water. This is a secondary (delayed) drowning. When he came out, he wasn't crying. It was a sound, like a cry for help, that's all he could do. …”Justin’s death set off a national debate in Romania, where the Orthodox Church is one of the most powerful and influential institutions.A Romanian teacher, Vladimir Dumitru, launched an online petition demanding that the Romanian Orthodox Church reform the christening ritual to make it “less brutal” and less dangerous for infants. So far, the petition has gained more than 65,000 signatures.ROMANIA -- Priest Nicolae Ganga (C) baptizes a child during a mass Orthodox baptism ceremony at a church in the Bora neighborhood in Slobozia, November 29, 2012.The Orthodox christening tradition requires three full immersions. The petition proposes a baptism by simply sprinkling holy water over the head of the baby.The church, however, has rejected that proposal. On February 25, its decision-making body, the Holy Synod, announced that the ritual would not be changed or altered, citing its “statutory obligation … to remain in communion and dogmatic (doctrinal), liturgical (sacramental) and canonical (disciplinary) unity with the universal Orthodox Church.”The synod said its decision was made to address “the discussions, concerns and misunderstandings that appeared in the public space on the topic of the Baptism of children with poor health.” At the same time, the synod urged priests to be more careful and that a pediatrician’s approval would be required for an infant christening.News reports describe Teodosie, who is a member of the Holy Synod, as one of the harshest critics of the proposed baptismal reform. He said the petition is an effort to “intimidate” the church and claimed the baptismal font’s cold water is good for babies’ health. The two-millennia-old canons of faith will remain intact, he proclaimed.Teodosie is a controversial figure. According to the Romanian outlet G4Media.ro, he ignored and violated the government’s COVID-19 pandemic-related ban on mass gatherings in churches. In one instance, he reportedly used a single teaspoon to provide communion, violating safe practice.ROMANIA -- A woman shouts holding a religious icon during a protest against the use of face masks and the protection measures against the COVID-19 infections in Bucharest, October 10, 2020.Police have investigated Teodosie as part of several corruption and embezzlement cases, but he has been acquitted. According to the investigative site Romania Corruption Watch, Teodosie allegedly was an informer for the communist secret police under the code name “Mache.”About 87% of Romanians are Orthodox Christians. There is no separation of the state and religion in Romania. The Orthodox churches of Russia and Georgia also have been criticized for baptism practices.";http://www.dw.com/en/romania-orthodox-church-washes-its-hands-of-babys-baptism-death/a-56513955,https://alephnews.ro/guvern/ips-teodosie-despre-cazul-bebelusului-inecat-acum-cativa-ani-a-fost-inecat-un-copilas-cu-lapte-nu-este-imposibil-sa-nu-se-fi-intamplat-la-fel-si-acum/,https://www.obiectivdesuceava.ro/local/un-nou-nascut-doar-sase-saptamani-a-ajuns-la-terapie-intensiva-direct-de-la-slujba-de-botez/,https://www.antena3.ro/actualitate/bebelus-mort-botez-suceava-dosar-penal-ucidere-culpa-592490.html,https://www.antena3.ro/actualitate/bebelus-mort-botez-suceava-dosar-penal-ucidere-culpa-592490.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-orthodox-church-baptism-baby-death/31133162.html,https://campaniamea.declic.ro/petitions/modificati-ritualul-botezului-prin-scufundarea-pruncului-in-cristelnita?bucket&source=facebook-share-button&time=1612205296&utm_campaign&utm_source=facebook&share=052c3397-5d81-41e0-ae73-88438a505f18&fbclid=IwAR0vwhOMxUv6xpCiG5CcXZ8MLJyWG4k-lSId8UtgF8JBc4bWE5wjqcqbrsI,https://www.rferl.org/a/romania-orthodox-church-baptism-baby-death/31133162.html,https://basilica.ro/sfantul-sinod-primele-decizii-din-2021/,https://www.christianpost.com/news/romanian-orthodox-baptism-ritual-criticized-after-infant-dies.html,https://www.g4media.ro/sfidare-totala-a-regulilor-guvernamentale-si-canoanelor-bisericesti-arhiepiscopul-teodosie-reface-slujba-de-paste-si-cheama-credinciosii-sa-ia-lumina-in-noaptea-de-26-spre-27-mai.html?fbclid=IwAR3DkK2PetykYTaKWovFrlCiZB85T19uA3zz5EwQ1RN4Y1TWWjXH2t_3TkU,https://medium.com/romania-corruption-watch/his-eminence-teodosie-is-heavens-business-class-613c4b30aa1b,https://orthodoxwiki.org/Church_of_Romania;When an Infant Dies After Baptism, Romanian Cleric Falsely Blames Parents;;;;;;

The story made it to the top of Russia’s most popular internet search engine, Yandex.ru. The trouble is, the “news” is fake. The Pentagon made no such announcement; “Block IV” is not the newest Tomahawk missile; and the story originated from a false interpretation of a two-year-old media report.Here is what actually happened.Media reports in Russia cited Avia.pro, a website with ties to the Russian Air Force, as the source of the information about an unexploded intact Tomahawk Block IV. Avia.pro reported on March 21: “The U.S. announced that Russian troops captured the American army’s main cruise missile.”But that story cited as a source a U.S. international affairs magazine The National Interest.The National Interest “stated that the American military is facing very serious problems,” Avia.pro reported, and that the capture of the cruise missile was “Moscow’s grand achievement,” allowing Russia “to study the U.S. most modern military technologies.”But none of that is in The National Interest article. Moreover, The National Interest story questions whether a dud missile was captured at all and assesses the risks of learning U.S. military secrets as minimal.The Tomahawk IV “is still a Cold War subsonic cruise missile that seems a bit of a dinosaur when compared to the supersonic and hypersonic weapons that are being developed today. If Russia, which fields an impressive array of tactical missiles, needs to learn from the Tomahawk, then Moscow has problems,” The National Interest story reads.As it turns out, The National Interest piece is a republication of an article that was first posted on December 12, 2019. In addition, the alleged capture of an unexploded Tomahawk Block IV in Syria was first reported by the Russian Defense Ministry on April 25, 2018.Earlier that month, the United States, United Kingdom and France conducted missile strikes in Syria after an alleged chemical weapons attack by Syrian government forces against the civilian population in Douma.Initially, Russia claimed its systems had downed 71 American Tomahawk cruise missiles in a single strike. Polygraph.info debunked that claim.Finally, while the Tomahawk Block IV is indeed an advanced weapon, it is not “the most modern U.S. military technology.” Nor is it the “newest” Tomahawk: There is a Block V that is more advanced.This disinformation follows reports in late January that the U.S. had obtained and smuggled out of Libya one of Russia’s highly praised military weapons: a Pantsir-S1 air defense unit.";https://military.pravda.ru/news/1604926-rossiya_siriya_ssha_tomahawk/,https://vk-smi.ru/strana-i-mir/syria/1116627,https://infosmi.net/politic/212951-rossiyskie-voennye-v-sirii-zahvatili-noveyshuyu-versiyu-amerikanskoy-rakety-tomahawk-block-iv/,https://twitter.com/ReCompTGL/status/1373636083112632327?s=20,https://yandex.ru/news/instory/Voennye_RF_vSirii_zakhvatili_novejshuyu_versiyu_rakety_Tomahawk_Block_IV_VVS_SSHA--7ee555684ce76fc434f7f78120e86e54?lr=109838&content=alldocs&persistent_id=136018232&stid=O2l_061bxF4SMjY4itVe,https://avia.pro/news/rossiya-zahvatila-v-sirii-amerikanskuyu-raketu-i-gotovitsya-vzlomat-eyo-noveyshuyu-versiyu,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-interest/,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/oops-russia-says-it-seized-dud-tomahawk-cruise-missile-syria-180611,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-got-its-hands-us-tomahawk-missile-syria-and-plans-counter-them-103982,https://youtu.be/YXzMCNWiouo,https://www.polygraph.info/a/syria-russia-71-missiles-claim-fact-cheched/29169608.html,https://www.raytheonmissilesanddefense.com/capabilities/products/tomahawk-cruise-missile,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a34979788/new-block-v-tomahawk-cruise-missile/,https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/12/14/the-us-navy-has-an-upgraded-tomahawk-heres-5-things-you-should-know/,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38964/the-united-states-smuggled-a-russian-made-pantsir-air-defense-system-out-of-libya-report,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2020/05/19/feared-russian-missile-system-targeted-and-captured-in-libya/?sh=9d25d891a5cb;Russia’s ‘Breaking’ U.S. Missile News is Two Years Old and Fake;;;;;;

Queiroga replaces Eduardo Pazuello, who leaves amid investigations into his handling of the health care in Manaus earlier this year, when overrun hospitals broke down for a second time after running out of oxygen for COVID-19 patients. Pazuello is also being probed to determine whether he committed administrative impropriety in using public money to purchase medicines that are ineffective against the virus, and also whether he failed to take the necessary steps to purchase vaccines.As Polygraph.info reported in January, members of Brazil's political opposition and various experts, among others, blamed Bolsonaro's administration and the governor of Amazonas state for the crisis. But leaders, including Pazuello, deflected blame. The day that Bolsonaro announced a new health minister, Pazuello spoke to reporters about the ministry’s progress in fighting COVID-19. He proclaimed “total transparency in all the actions of the ministry,” which were “available for the entire Brazilian population.” He also spoke about vaccinations, saying Brazil ranked fifth worldwide in vaccine distribution and that “more than 11.5 million Brazilians, effectively, from priority groups” had received shots. Some of Pazuello’s claims were wrong or misleading.  Intensive Care Unit treating COVID-19 coronavirus patients in the Gilberto Novaes Hospital in Manaus on May 20, 2020. Pazuello took over in an interim capacity in mid-May 2020, and then became health minister four months later. As Brazil emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot, the government rescheduled release of daily COVID-19 statistics to 10 p.m., purportedly to avoid “underreporting and inconsistencies.” But critics said the move made it harder to get the information out, and news agencies objected because the updated numbers wouldn’t be available in prime time. As Brazil became the country with second-highest number of COVID-19 cases (behind only the United States), and a day after a new record was set in the country for deaths from the virus, the government also stopped publishing cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths, instead releasing only daily figures. The decision to reschedule the release of daily COVID-19 statistics also was criticized by health specialists, politicians and ordinary citizens alike, who said it muddied the waters and made it harder to track progression of the virus. And since it takes a few days for deaths to be counted, they said it could create a false sense that COVID-19 deaths were decreasing. The ministry was forced to back down; meantime, six news agencies created a consortium to gather total daily numbers of cases and deaths. That effort is ongoing.  An employee inspects vials containing CoronaVac vaccine at Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo, on January 12, 2021. Pazuello's comments about the vaccine rollout exaggerate the country’s progress. Brazil ranks fifth in the world in the absolute number of vaccine doses administered – more than 13.6 million as of March 22 – but 71st when population size is taken into account, with 6.38 doses for every 100 people. Israel, which leads among nations in the number of vaccines per capita, has 112.5 doses administered for every 100 people. (Gibraltar, the British overseas territory, ranks No. 1 on the list, with nearly 158 doses for every 100 people. Disregarding vaccination in British territories, Brazil ranks 59th in the world.) Pazuello’s comment that “more than 11.5 million Brazilians, effectively, from priority groups” have been vaccinated, was misleading.As of March 15, the day he spoke, nearly 8.9 Brazilians had been vaccinated with at least one dose. Out of the 8.9 million, 2.9 million had received two shots. So while nearly 11.8 million doses had been administered by then, fewer people got shots than Pazuello claimed. Brazil's COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been much slower than in many other countries. Critics blame Bolsonaro and his administration for consistently downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and working against locally imposed lockdowns and other containment methods. Bolsonaro spent emergency funds to produce and distribute chloroquine, the malaria drug that is ineffective against COVID-19. He also has been openly skeptical about the use of vaccines. In August, Pfizer offered the Brazilian government 70 million doses of its vaccine produced with BioNTech, but Pazuello’s health ministry was not interested in the deal, calling it “abusive.” Pfizer said its terms were the same offered to other countries, CNN Brasil reported. In December, however, Bolsonaro told Brazilians that if the Pfizer vaccine turned them into “alligators"" it was “their problem.”Bolsonaro also said last October that he wouldn’t buy vaccines from China, even though the health ministry announced the purchase of 46 million doses of China's CoronaVac, and São Paulo's Instituto Butantan, one of the world’s leading scientific centers, had received doses of CoronaVac. Bolsonaro reversed himself a month later, saying Brazil would purchase CoronaVac.As infections and deaths climbed in Brazil, the government worked to get drugmaker AstraZeneca’s vaccine, making a deal to produce it in Brazil. In January, however, its active ingredient was stuck in China awaiting approval for shipment, Bloomberg reported. In mid-January, the government prepared a plane to pick up 2 million vaccine doses from India, but plans were delayed for a week, and the doses did not arrive until January 22. Brazil first began vaccinating the people on January 18, with the CoronaVac vaccine in São Paulo. In comparison, the U.S. began its vaccine rollout more than a month earlier, in mid-December. Then there is the syringe shortage. In early January, Bolsonaro suspended syringe purchases because of high prices. The health ministry said that while there are more than 80 million syringes and needles available, seven out of 26 states are at risk of shortages.

The outbreak continues to worsen in Brazil, which has surpassed the United States to become No. 1 in the world in terms of daily cases and deaths .

Bush met with Putin and later said, ""I was able to get a sense of his soul.""Russia reacted swiftly to Biden’s new comments, recalling its ambassador from Washington for consultations on March 17.Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with journalists as he attends a concert marking the seventh anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on March 18, 2021.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the remarks “unprecedented” in the history of Russian-U.S. relations, adding that Biden had no intention of restoring bilateral relations and that an “absolutely clear” Russian response would be forthcoming.Putin himself responded to being called a killer by repeating a Russian version of the children’s riposte: “I'm rubber, you’re glue” (i.e., what you say about me bounces off and sticks on you). Putin specifically noted episodes in U.S. history – slavery, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan and the treatment of Native Americans – to argue that Biden was in no position to criticize him.Russia’s Foreign Ministry released a statement blaming the United States for deteriorating bilateral relations: “The current situation is a consequence of Washington’s purposeful policy, which over the past several years, in fact, has deliberately led bilateral relations to a dead end.”That is false. The breakdown in U.S.-Russia relations and subsequent sanctions targeting Russia have been a direct result of Russian actions, from the invasion and occupation of territory in Ukraine to violations of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act to repeated interference in U.S. elections and cyberattacks.On December 19, 2014, then U.S. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and occupation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Obama’s move followed a similar one by the European Union.Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a concert marking the seventh anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia on March 18, 2021.The U.S. authorized additional sanctions against “individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people.”The U.S. has also sanctioned Russia for malicious cyber activities, including intrusions into the U.S. energy grid and deployment of the Triton malware, which was designed to target and manipulate industrial safety systems. Triton has been described as “the world’s most murderous malware.”Russian intelligence was fingered in the 2020 SolarWinds cyberattack, which infected 18,000 U.S. entities with malware, including the U.S. government’s Defense, Energy, Homeland Security and State departments.Experts have linked Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) to the attack.The U.S. further sanctioned Russia-linked individuals and entities for alleged election interference and influence operations in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.According to the Congressional Research Service, the United States also has imposed sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses, the use of a chemical weapons, weapons proliferation, illicit trade with North Korea, and support for the regimes in Syria and Venezuela.On March 17, the U.S. announced that it will expand export restrictions on Russia for using “chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals.”Those sanctions were in response to the Russian government’s reported use of the military-grade nerve agent Novichok on March 4, 2018, in the attack on former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in the United Kingdom.Then, on August 20, 2020, the Russian government allegedly used Novichok against Russian opposition figure Aleksei Navalny on Russian soil.Earlier U.S. sanctions were aimed at limiting the export of technology that could aid Russia in the development of chemical and biological weapons.The U.S. has said those sanctions could be removed if Moscow provides “reliable assurances that it will not use chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law and will not use lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals.”Russia is among signatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the large-scale use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons and their precursors.Russian opposition figure Aleksei Navalny being transferred to Berlin for tests and treatment from a hospital in Omsk on August 22 following Novichok poisoning.The U.S. has also been criticized for contributing to the deterioration in U.S.-Russian relations.In June 2019, the U.S. ramped up digital incursions into Russia’s electric power grid in response to years of public warnings over Russia's insertion of malware that could sabotage U.S. infrastructure, The New York Times reported.Some observers have criticized the U.S. for withdrawing from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, under which the U.S. and Soviet Union destroyed thousands of short- to intermediate-range missiles, and from the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which allows treaty-signatory countries to fly over each other’s territory with sensors to detect military activity and equipment. The United States withdrew from those treaties during the previous administration of President Donald Trump.In both instances, the U.S. said the withdrawal was precipitated by Russian violations of the respective treaties.";https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-recalls-its-ambassador-u-s-after-biden-brands-putin-n1261379,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-biden-putin-killer-comment/31157401.html,https://www.waywordradio.org/discussion/topics/origin-of-im-rubber-youre-glue/,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-201400949/html/DCPD-201400949.htm,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/world/europe/european-union-imposes-new-sanctions-over-russias-inteference-in-ukraine.html,https://www.state.gov/ukraine-and-russia-sanctions/,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1162,https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/05/103328/cybersecurity-critical-infrastructure-triton-malware/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-solar-winds-russia-evidence/31121799.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-treasury/u-s-imposes-fresh-russia-sanctions-for-election-meddling-idUSKCN1OI27F,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-hits-back-russian-election-disinformation-ring,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45415.pdf,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-sanctions-two-russia-based-entities-over-north-korean-forced-labor,https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/03/us-department-commerce-expand-restrictions-exports-russia-response,https://www.polygraph.info/a/31016045.html,https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-and-other-measures-imposed-on-russia-in-response-to-russias-use-of-chemical-weapons/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-us-arms-control/30710428.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-us-open-skies-treaty/29449962.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-inf-treaty-missile-fact-check/29757757.html;Who Really Led U.S.-Russia Relations to a Dead End?;;;;;;
215;;;;Misleading;Rodrigo Duterte;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-duterte-philippines-womens-day/6742848.html;Duterte Makes Misleading Claims about Gender Equity in Philippines;2021-03-09;polygraph;;"On March 8, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte marked International Women’s Day with a statement encouraging Filipinos to celebrate “the indispensable role of women in our nation’s progress.”He urged support for those who “seek to fight for and acknowledge women as equal partners of men.”Duterte added: “While there is much to be done to completely free women from this bondage of inequality, we can nonetheless proudly claim that concrete, sustainable, and inclusive actions have been taken by our government to create an environment where women’s rights are respected and their contributions to society are recognized.”Duterte delivers a speech during the 11th Biennial National Convention and 22nd founding anniversary of the Chinese Filipino Business Club, Inc., in Manila, Feb. 10, 2020.He also said every Filipina should be empowered to break both the barriers that had kept them from reaching their potential and “the backwards mindset that fueled a culture of gender oppression and inequality.”To be sure, the Philippine government has taken steps to foster women’s rights and earned kudos from some for gender equity. However, Duterte’s words are misleading – because own actions and rhetoric as head of state have undermined some of that progress.His behavior with women has long courted controversy. He’s repeatedly made jokes about rape, called female police and army officers “bitches,"" and kissed a married woman on the lips in public during a 2018 visit to South Korea. He also confessed to molesting a family maid as a teenager.In January, while dismissing speculation his daughter might succeed him, Duterte said women are unfit to be president. In 2018, he said that the next anti-corruption ombudsman should not be a woman, adding some jobs are not for women.As a result, hundreds of demonstrators marked International Women’s Day this week by marching to protest what Reuters called Duterte’s “alleged rights abuses against women.”According to the Philippines constitution, the state “recognizes the role of women in nation-building, and shall ensure the fundamental equality before the law of women and men.”In addition, the country’s so-called 2009 Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act No. 9710) “affirms the role of women in nation-building and ensures the substantive equality of women and men.” It further recognizes “that equality of men and women entails the abolition of the unequal structures and practices that perpetuate discrimination and inequality.”The World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2020 ranked the Philippines 16 out of 153 countries measured. While that is high, it marked an eight-spot drop from the previous year.The report said the Philippines gender gap remained the smallest in Asia, having made significant advances in closing the economic participation, educational attainment, health, and survival gaps.However, the WEF said the political empowerment gap in the Philippines had widened, partially because the number of women serving in Duterte’s cabinet dropped from 25% in 2017 to 10% in 2019.In its own assessment of the Philippines, Freedom House, a human rights group partially funded by the U.S. government, cited the WEF, noting that “the political realm remains male-dominated, with women occupying only 23 percent of national and local elective positions.”The New York-based group said that women made up 28% of the Philippines’ legislature after the 2019 election and that “few women are elected without following in the footsteps of a male relative.”Activists destroy an effigy of Duterte during a rally near the Malacanang presidential palace to mark International Women's Day on Monday, March 8, 2021 in Manila.In comparison, women hold approximately 27.4% of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 24 out of 50 seats in the U.S. Senate. The Japan International Cooperation Agency, part of the Japanese government, said women in the Philippines live in a situation characterized by “sharp contradictions.”It said that Filipino women “may be considered as one of the most advanced” in the areas of academic, professional, and political participation, but they also face domestic violence, economic disadvantages, discrimination at the workplace, exploitation as migrant workers, and sexual exploitation. A number of laws protect women’s rights in the Philippines, though most precede Duterte’s tenure as president.In 2019, Duterte signed a law giving women 105 days of paid maternity leave. The U.S., by contrast, has no nationally mandated maternity leave. Also in 2019, Duterte signed an anti-sexual harassment law that bans catcalls, unwanted contact, sexist slurs, and statements/gestures in offices, schools, and streets about women’s physical appearance. Violators face fines and prison sentences.The law hasn’t spared Duterte from criticism. The leftist Gabriela Women's Party, which advocates for women’s issues, said Duterte “represents the single most brazen violator of the law's intent with his staple macho-fascist remarks.” Others allege Duterte signed the legislation to show “he believes himself above the law.”The University of California’s 21st Century Global Dynamics faculty research group said that Duterte had labeled women’s groups “gaga” (“stupid women”). They called the comment a “direct assault on such organizations” and said Duterte “takes every opportunity to belittle the efforts of political women.”The researchers accused Duterte of showing “a special propensity to persecute female political leaders,” while also targeting prominent female journalists.They also said sexual violence targeting indigenous women in conflict zones has been met with a muted response from Philippine authorities.";https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-17/philippines-presidential-candidate-condemned-for-joke-about-rape/7333300,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/12/rodrigo-duterte-calls-women-at-gender-equality-event-bitches-philippines,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte/philippines-duterte-stirs-controversy-by-kissing-woman-on-lips-idUSKCN1J014W,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-01/rodrigo-duterte-says-he-sexually-assaulted-a-maid/10677124,https://www.rappler.com/nation/sexist-duterte-says-philippine-presidency-not-a-job-for-women,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/05/24/1818299/duterte-says-some-jobs-are-inappropriate-women,https://news.yahoo.com/filipinas-denounce-duterte-world-marks-142903151.html,https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2009/08/14/republic-act-no-9710-2/,http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf,https://freedomhouse.org/country/philippines/freedom-world/2021,https://www.jica.go.jp/english/our_work/thematic_issues/gender/background/c8h0vm0000anjqj6-att/philippines_summary_2008.pdf,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1063739,https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-signs-law-giving-mothers-105-days-paid-leaves,https://www.france24.com/en/20190716-misogynist-duterte-slammed-over-philippines-anti-harassment-law,https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-rodrigo-duterte-protector-of-womens-rights/a-49615601,https://www.21global.ucsb.edu/global-e/june-2020/women-s-rights-philippines-era-authoritarianism,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/15/philippines-rappler-verdict-blow-media-freedom;Duterte Makes Misleading Claims about Gender Equity in Philippines;;;;;;

Khashoggi, 59, was lured to the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in hope of getting paperwork needed to marry his fiance. He entered the consulate but never came out, and evidence soon emerged that a special Saudi team sent to Turkey killed and dismembered Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman (MBS), while he was inside. Khashoggi's remains have never been found.The ODNI assessed named 18 participants it said were ""complicit in or responsible for"" the killing ""on behalf of"" MBS.“We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” the ODNI stated in the report’s executive summary.“We base this assessment on the Crown Prince's control of decision making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince's support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi.” The Saudi government and its supporters reacted to the ODNI report with hostility, with the Saudi Foreign Ministry tweeting: “The Government of The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Completely Rejects the Assessment in the Report Submitted to U.S.’ Congress Regarding Murder of Saudi Citizen Jamal Khashoggi.""The tweet was accompanied by a longer statement, part of which read: “This crime was committed by a group of individuals that have transgressed all pertinent regulations and authorities of the agencies where they were employed. The relevant authorities in the Kingdom took all possible measures within our legal system to ensure that these individuals were properly investigated, and to ensure that justice was served.” The claim that the Kingdom “took all possible measures” to bring those responsible to justice is false.The ODNI report noted that since 2017, MBS has had “absolute control of the Kingdom’s security and intelligence organizations,” making it unlikely that operatives of those organizations would have acted contrary to his orders. The report said the squad sent to the consulate included a close MBS adviser and members of his personal security detail.Others involved included members of two Saudi government organizations – the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Royal Court (CSMARC), and the Rapid Intervention Force, sometimes called the Rapid Intervention Group, an elite unit of the Royal Guard which answers only to MBS and which has been accused of harassing, kidnapping, and torturing his critics at home and abroad. Both of these organizations were headed by Saud al Qahtani, a close MBS adviser, who publicly stated in 2018 that he did not make decisions without the crown prince’s approval. (Al Qahtani is among responsible parties identified in the ODNI report.)Turkish authorities reported that following the murder, there were attempts to tamper with evidence inside the Saudi consulate. They said footage from security cameras had been removed, and that the day of the murder, Turkish staff working at the consulate were told to take the day off. Footage from security cameras at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport footage showed members of the Saudi hit squad arriving on a private jet and entering through airport security.A member of that squad was videoed leaving the Saudi consulate grounds in the clothes Khashoggi had been wearing the day he was murdered, in an apparent attempt to create the impression that he’d left the consulate. And the Turkish government later released chilling audio recordings from inside the consulate of Khashoggi and the moments before he was killed and just after.The Saudi government at first denied that Khashoggi had been killed, claiming instead that he left the consulate safely. MBS repeated that claim in an interview with Bloomberg news. Saudi state-owned media backed the denials and pointed fingers at Qatar and Khashoggi’s fiance, suggesting they concocted the story of the murder to smear the crown prince.Although the Saudis eventually held a trial, it was neither swift nor transparent. The proceedings were secret, and a United Nations  expert referred to it as a “parody of justice.” The trial consisted of 10 hearings and followed the Saudi government’s line that Khashoggi's death was not premeditated. Members of Khashoggi’s family and some foreign diplomats were present to observe the hearings but were sworn to secrecy and not permitted to speak.In December 2019, five Saudi officials were sentenced to death for their involvement in the killing, while three other defendants received sentences totaling 24 years in prison. In May 2020, Khashoggi’s children requested that the five men sentenced to death be pardoned, as is their right under Saudi law.Khashoggi’s fiance, Hatice Cengiz, wrote on social media that the trial had been a “mockery of justice,” noting that it did not address the questions of who planned the killing, who ordered it, or what happened to Khashoggi’s body.Saud al Qahtani, who is believed to have overseen the operation, was arrested for the murder but cleared of any involvement due to lack of evidence, according to Saudi authorities. Prior to the assassination, al Qahtani had exchanged messages with Khashoggi, threatening him over his writing. He had also sent messages attempting to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia.Since 2019, al Qahtani has been banned entry to the U.S. for his suspected involvement in the murder. After the ODNI report was released, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration imposed visa restrictions on 76 Saudi officials but was criticized for refusing to sanction MBS, even though the report implicated him in the murder. Critics noted that the response effectively broke Biden’s campaign promise that he would hold MBS accountable. For his part, bin Salman has flatly denied ordering Khashoggi's murder but said he took ""full responsibility"" as a leader in the Saudi government for a ""heinous crime.""";https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Assessment-Saudi-Gov-Role-in-JK-Death-20210226v2.pdf,https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Assessment-Saudi-Gov-Role-in-JK-Death-20210226v2.pdf,https://news.sky.com/story/jamal-khashoggi-how-journalist-met-his-death-11522641,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/middleeast/khashoggi-crown-prince-saudi.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/6/saudis-tampered-with-cctv-cameras-after-khashoggi-murder-report,https://news.sky.com/story/jamal-khashoggi-how-journalist-met-his-death-11522641,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49826905,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45937448,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45785719,https://theintercept.com/2018/10/13/khashoggi-saudi-media/,http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/khashoggi-trial-was-an-exercise-in-scapegoating-and-not-justice-1.4123789,http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/khashoggi-trial-was-an-exercise-in-scapegoating-and-not-justice-1.4123789,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/23/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-verdict-analysis-intl/index.html,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-50890633,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/middleeast/khashoggi-children-pardon-saudi-intl/index.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/8/complete-mockery-saudi-arabia-condemned-over-khashoggi-ruling,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2019/06/26/lord-of-the-flies-an-open-source-investigation-into-saud-al-qahtani/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/middleeast/khashoggi-crown-prince-saudi.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/biden-mohammed-bin-salman-jamal-khashoggi/index.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50890633;Was ‘Justice Served’ by Saudis in Jamal Khashoggi’s Murder?;;;;;;
217;;;;False;Viral global claim;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-covid-vaccine-fertility/6742845.html;No, COVID-19 Vaccines Don’t Make You Infertile;2021-03-08;polygraph;;"The claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility is one of the most common myths among Americans who say they will “definitely not” get vaccinated, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a health-focused nonprofit in California.But the U.S. is not alone. Variations of the sterilization myth are among the most persistent global coronavirus disinformation trends, according to the World Health Organization’s Vaccine Myths vs Science podcast.Along with the WHO scientists, fact-checkers in Indonesia, Ghana, the U.K., Arabic-speaking countries, Turkey, local U.S. media, and doctor-run health sources have provided abundant proof that the claim is false.Baseless assertions of infertility continue to circulate nonetheless. Meantime, overall vaccine acceptance may have declined somewhat, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, which said a late January survey in 23 countries found that only 63 percent planned to get vaccinated, down from 66 percent earlier.Why is the infertility myth so persistent? How did it start? Who keeps pushing it?Blame the internet and social media.The Washington Post reported that a growing number of women of child-bearing age in the U.S. are hesitant about inoculation, and that most got the information from friends who saw it on the internet. The Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported that 40% of “the vaccine hesitant are self-selecting social media information sources they are comfortable with.”According to The Associated Press, most of those who share the fertility disinfo on social media cite sources that seem authoritative at first glance, though not after a closer look.The myth that the vaccines would make women infertile seems to have started after a German Socialist lawmaker and doctor, Wolfgang Wodarg, filed a petition with the European Medicine Agency demanding a halt to clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine, the AP reported.In that petition, Wodarg suggested that antibodies created after vaccination would attack a protein vital to formation of the placenta, “which would result in vaccinated women essentially becoming infertile.”However, many doctors and other experts say that’s bunk. Pfizer also reported that during its vaccine trial, 23 women became pregnant. One lost the pregnancy, but she had received a placebo and not the actual vaccine.Pfizer addressed the infertility issue and Wodarg’s theory directly.“It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is partly shared with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1,” the company said. “From a scientific perspective, the differences between the two sequences are quite significant, making it very unlikely our vaccine could generate a response that would harm the placenta.”Yet, Wodarg’s petition has been picked up by anti-vaxxers and anti-abortion activists and spread across the web and social media.Some observers believe “Utopia,” a popular Amazon Original mini-series that premiered on September 25, 2020, contributed to a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 vaccines are designed for population control. “Utopia” is a fictional story about a doctor obsessed with the Earth’s overpopulation, who creates a false deadly flu pandemic to convince people to take his vaccine, which he designed to make humans infertile.A variant of the myth – that COVID-19 vaccines cause male sterilization – is popular in some countries. These include Israel, where 70 prominent doctors signed a letter to the public stating: “A rumor that the vaccine causes infertility is particularly prevalent in Jewish circles, yet there is no evidence behind it.""Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, director of reproductive urology at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine, said that concern over the risk of male infertility may be related to studies showing that the SARs-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can affect the male reproductive system. But there is no actual virus in the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines, the first two COVID-19 vaccines to be approved in the U.S., which use genetic material to teach the body to make antibodies that fight off the coronavirus. “People think that the vaccine actually has the virus in it. But the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines that have emergency use authorization from the FDA, are just the mRNA vaccines that make a protein that the COVID virus expresses,” Ramasamy told Winknews, a Florida radio station. “So, it is not the full virus and it does not biologically appear to actually bind to the testes and affect testicular function.”The newest U.S.-approved vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, uses a small piece of genetic material from the coronavirus to create immunity. The material used does not replicate in the body. Correction: The Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs did not blame infertility fears for a decline in vaccine acceptance, as reported in an earlier version of this fact check.

All are banned from voting or participating in future elections.On March 2, the CNRP said in a statement that it “resolutely rejects the ‘verdict’” handed down by the court. But Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin defended the court decision, saying prosecution of the opposition leaders was lawful.“[T]the authorities have acted in accordance with legal procedures, and the courts conducted the trial based on procedure and made decisions based on the facts and existing legal aspects,” the Khmer Times quoted him as saying.That is false. Outside observers said the trial failed to meet basic standards of due process.The court delivered its verdict in a hearing that was neither attended by the defendants nor defense lawyers. New-York based Human Rights Watch said local nongovernmental organizations were provided “inaccurate information” about the verdict hearing date, so “no trial monitors were in the courtroom on March 1.”Rainsy and others were not allowed to return to Cambodia to take part in their own defense. Court spokesperson Y Rin tried to justify the exclusion of the defendants from the verdict hearing by saying government lawyers had been present at the hearing.The European Union rejected that argument.“The accused were not allowed to return to the country to defend their cases in court, in what appears to be a violation of due process rights, firmly established by international human rights law,” the European External Action Service said.U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia W. Patrick Murphy tweeted he was “troubled” by the sentencing, “particularly given a lack of due process.”Responding to Murphy, HRW Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson expressed “outrage” at the verdict. “It's a politically motivated case based on bogus charges, heard by kangaroo court that issued ridiculously long sentences, & didn't even tell people when verdicts would be issued,” he wrote.Rainsy’s latest conviction stems from his attempt to return to Cambodia on November 9, 2019, where he already faced years behind bars for previous convictions.Prime Minister Hun Sen had threatened to deploy the army “and use weapons of all kinds” to attack CNRP supporters “wherever they are seen” if Rainsy returned.Rainsy said that a popular uprising was “the only option left for Cambodia to bring about democratic change,” citing Hun Sen’s increasingly authoritarian 36-year reign. Following the July 2018 general election, Cambodia became a one-party state. The European Union, Japan, the United States and others called the election “illegitimate.""On Thursday, March 4, Hun Sen said he would rule indefinitely.In 2019, Rainsy said he would reevaluate his decision to return to Cambodia and calls for a popular uprising if Hun Sen released imprisoned CNRP leader Kem Sokha, reinstated the CNRP and held free and fair elections, Reuters reported.For more than a decade, Rainsy has been subjected to a slew of criminal prosecutions supporters say are linked to his political activity. He left Cambodia in 2015 after being hit with defamation charges. He has been charged and convicted in absentia numerous times, including a defamation and incitement conviction over claims that the state murdered political analyst Kem Ley in 2016.Rainsy stepped down as CNRP leader in February 2017 in a failed bid to save the party. His successor, Sokha, was arrested in September 2017 for an alleged foreign-backed plot to overthrow Hun Sen’s government. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted in another case that has been widely condemned.In November 2017, following Sokha’s arrest, Cambodia’s top court dissolved the CNRP, a move Charles Santiago, chairman of the advocacy group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, called ""the final nail in the coffin for Cambodian democracy.”The court has been slow in moving on Sokha’s trial, which he says violates his rights. In February, the court said the trial, already delayed for a year, might not resume in 2021 due to coronavirus concerns. In January, the court said Sokha’s case was not a priority, even as mass trials of lower-profile opposition figures began that month.Amnesty International estimates 150 people affiliated with the CNRP are facing jail on charges that include treason and incitement.The CNRP has condemned the crackdown.“Throughout the rushed mass trials conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, no reliable evidence was presented, the defendants were not allowed to be present, and the public was largely excluded from the proceedings. The farce that was staged by the Phnom Penh court violates the procedural and substantive requirements of a fair trial reflected in the Cambodian Code and Article 14(3)(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights,” the CNRP wrote in the March 2 statement.CNRP members are regularly assaulted, and family members face intimidation and harassment.";https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/sentenced-03012021173934.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/03/cambodia-quash-conviction-opposition-leaders,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/cambodia-opposition-leaders-receive-outrageously-harsh-jail-terms-alleged-coup,https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/94036/cambodia-statement-spokesperson-mass-trials-conducted-against-opposition-figures_en,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-politics/cambodia-pm-threatens-to-deploy-troops-if-opposition-leaders-return-idUSKBN1WM11V,https://aseanmp.org/2020/11/09/dissolution-of-opposition-party-cambodia/,https://asiatimes.com/2018/08/cambodia-is-now-officially-a-one-party-state/,https://www.voacambodia.com/a/in-another-flip-hun-sen-now-says-he-will-rule-indefinitely/5801808.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-politics/cambodia-pm-threatens-to-deploy-troops-if-opposition-leaders-return-idUSKBN1WM11V,https://www.refworld.org/docid/51e4f8274.html,https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50799324/rainsy-gets-four-more-years-former-opposition-activists-convicted/,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/sam-rainsy-sentenced-absentia,https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/rainsy-gets-20-months-for-kem-ley-murder-claim-127323/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/sam-rainsy-steps-down-02132017145153.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/hun-sen-color-revolution/30919386.html,https://aseanmp.org/2020/11/09/dissolution-of-opposition-party-cambodia/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/trial-02042021170012.html,https://www.voacambodia.com/a/phnom-penh-court-says-kem-sokha-trial-not-a-priority-/5734214.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/cambodia-opposition-mass-trials/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/assault-10192020172314.html,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/intimidation-10012020211737.html;Cambodia’s Lies About ‘Coup’ Case and Verdict;;;;;;

Therefore, I cannot answer your question. I am at a loss to say what the United States is rejecting in this case. I am not aware of any help."" Perhaps Peskov’s memory really is at fault, but the idea that the United States never helped Russia is false.In May 2020, the U.S. delivered a $5.6 million aid package to Russia, supplying 200 ventilators necessary for treating patients with severe cases of COVID-19. The delivery was carried out by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which had not worked in the country since 2012 because Russian authorities expelled the agency.U.S soldiers unload medical aid from the United States, including ventilators as a donation to help Russia tackle the coronavirus outbreak, after a U.S. air force plane landed at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, June 4, 2020.There is more on the U.S. government’s foreign assistance website. In 2020, the U.S. gave $8.54 million of aid worth to Russia. The bulk of it was $5.6 million for the COVID-19 assistance package mentioned above. But other items include $2.6 million for “peace and security” and $255,000 for environmental protection.The amounts going to Russia vary greatly by year, with one of the highest being in 2013, when spending totaled $42.1 million. However, that year 35% of that assistance went toward “democracy, human rights, and governance,” something which the Kremlin sees as interference in Russia’s internal affairs.Since U.S.-Russia relations fractured in 2014 after Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, cooperation has dropped off. However, the U.S. has provided aid at other times. In the 1990s, the U.S. sent food and medical supplies to Russia and other former republics of the Soviet Union. In 1990, then-president George Herbert Walker Bush spearheaded and effort to deliver surplus chicken, mostly legs, to the Soviet Union when it was facing serious shortages of food and other consumer goods.The chicken delivery was dubbed “Bush legs” by Russians.Other historical examples include “Lend-Lease,” a World War II-era program under which the U.S. delivered the modern-day equivalent of $180 billion in military, technical, and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union while it was struggling to rid itself of the Nazi German invader. In 1921, amid the Russian civil war, the American Relief Administration provided food aid to Russia when it was suffering from the famine.";https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-and-other-measures-imposed-on-russia-in-response-to-russias-use-of-chemical-weapons/,https://ru.usembassy.gov/delivery-of-u-s-ventilators-to-russia/,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860143691/u-s-sends-ventilators-to-russia-in-5-6-million-coronavirus-aid-package,https://foreignassistance.gov/explore/country/Russia,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32866.pdf,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/12/06/673806672/chicken-diplomacy-how-president-bush-went-for-the-gut-in-the-former-ussr,https://ru.usembassy.gov/world-war-ii-allies-u-s-lend-lease-to-the-soviet-union-1941-1945/,https://news.stanford.edu/pr/2011/pr-famine-040411.html;Has the U.S. Ever Helped Russia?

220;;;;False;RT;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-solar-winds-russia-evidence/6742828.html;RT Falsely Claims No Proof Kremlin is Behind SolarWinds Hack;2021-02-25;polygraph;;"On February 21, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, told CBS television's “Face the Nation” program that those responsible for “SolarWinds,” the massive 2020 cyberattack on the U.S. government, would face a response that included “a mix of tools seen and unseen.”And he blamed Moscow: “We will ensure that Russia understands where the United States draws the line on this kind of activity.”Russia’s RT state broadcaster reported on Sullivan’s comments and noted the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that the hack was “likely Russian in origin.”“This echoed evidence-free mainstream media claims as well as their own language in ‘assessments’ about the 2016 election,” RT wrote, referring to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Moscow has denied any involvement in the SolarWinds breach, calling it ‘yet another unsubstantiated attempt’ by the U.S. to scapegoat Russia.”The notion that media reports about the SolarWinds hack have been “evidence-free” is false. Although the U.S. has released limited information about the hack, multiple sources have presented evidence pointing to Russia’s involvement.SolarWinds is a U.S. company that provides computer network management services to the government and private businesses. Clients include defense contractors and federal agencies, including the Justice, Commerce and Treasury departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, among others.On December 13, the cybersecurity firm FireEye reported that hackers had attached malware to SolarWinds' premier product, the Orion network-monitoring tool, enabling high-level access to client computer networks.The hackers inserted malicious code into a March 2020 Orion update, in what is called a supply chain attack. That attack infected an estimated 18,000 clients, including the U.S. Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and State departments.Exterior view of the building of U.S. Department of the Treasury on March 27, 2020 in Washington, D.C., which was among those targeted in the SolarWinds attack.FireEye itself was a victim of an intrusion that CEO Kevin Mandia said was different “from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years.”“We are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities,” Mandia said in that December 13 statement. Although FireEye did not mention Russia by name, The New York Times reported the intrusion was handed over to the FBI’s Russia specialists.Speaking before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February 23, Mandia said the attack was far broader than SolarWinds and had been part of “a multi-decade campaign.” Without elaborating, he added that “we all pretty much know who [the threat actor] is.” The hackers behind the months-long attack reportedly accessed Microsoft’s source code. Microsoft President Brad Smith called the hack “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”Smith told the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February 23 that “a thousand very skilled, capable engineers worked on this,” adding the scale and sophistication of the operation was unprecedented.“At this stage we’ve seen substantial evidence that points to the Russian foreign intelligence agency and we’ve found no evidence that leads us anywhere else. So we’ll wait for the rest of the formal steps to be taken by the government and others, but there’s not a lot of suspense at this moment in terms of what we’re talking about,” Smith said.Both during his Senate testimony and in comments to CBS television’s ""60 Minutes” program that aired a week prior to the RT report, Smith drew a connecting line between the vast nature of the SolarWinds hack and Russia’s previous alleged hacking activities in Ukraine.“What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the United States. But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine,” he told “60 Minutes” in reference to the 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack. The CIA concluded with “high confidence” that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, carried out that attack.SolarWinds consultant Alex Stamos directly blamed Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). “One of the reasons that this campaign has been able to last for well over a year is because they [the SVR] are incredibly subtle about the intrusion into all these companies,” the tech publication CRN quoted Stamos as telling SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna during a webinar weeks prior to the RT report.U.S. intelligence agencies released a statement in January saying the SolarWinds hack was “an intelligence gathering effort” which was “likely Russian in origin.” Some Western intelligence agencies believe the SVR led the APT29 hacking group, also known as “Cozy Bear.”In January, Reuters reported what it called “the first publicly available evidence” corroborating U.S. claims Russia was behind the SolarWinds attack.Reuters cited the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which said it had found “specific code similarities” between Sunburst — the malware used in the SolarWinds intrusion — and an alleged Russian hacking tool called Kazuar.According to Reuters, Kazuar had been employed by the Turla or “Venomous Bear” hacking group, which is believed to work under the auspices of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor organization to the Soviet KGB.The Kazuar story was also covered by Britain’s Guardian newspaper, Fox Business and Wired magazine, along with tech and security publications.Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team, said the “identified connection does not give away who was behind the SolarWinds attack.”He did note the three matches in malware functionality were not “a copy-paste effort,” but more like the “handwriting” which “propagates to different projects written by the same person.""Kaspersky itself has been accused of working with the FSB. The company was subsequently banned from providing services to the U.S. government. Kaspersky denied it had had any inappropriate relationships with any government, and offered to disclose its source code to the U.S. government for audit, the security and risk management website CSO reported. Dmitri Alperovitch, the cofounder and former chief technology officer of security firm CrowdStrike, told Wired the Kaspersky findings confirm “the attribution to at least Russian intelligence.”As for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in 2019, the then Republican-led U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued a report concluding, after three years of investigations, that “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian effort to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Hillary Clinton and her campaign for president.”As Polygraph.info has reported, Moscow has denied allegations and evidence that Russian state hackers targeted governments and influential international institutions and organizations.Russian hacking operations have targeted Olympic committees, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the United Nations Agency for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the joint international team investigating the 2014 downing of Malaysian passenger jet MH17 over Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board.Russian hackers believed to be part of Cozy Bear have also been implicated in efforts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research.";https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/technology/fireeye-hacked-russians.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20201208&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=110246373&segment_id=46377&user_id=a21f09f9bdf6a9c0fd07512c91394a73,https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-hackers-accessed-microsoft-source-code/,https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-hearing-hack-us-networks-foreign-adversary,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html,https://www.crn.com/news/security/alex-stamos-attributes-solarwinds-hack-to-russian-intel-service,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-solarwinds/solarwinds-hackers-linked-to-known-russian-spying-tools-investigators-say-idINKBN29G16Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/11/solarwinds-hack-russian-spying-tools-hackers-malware-fsb,https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/cybersecurity-firm-third-malware-strain-solarwinds-hack,https://www.wired.com/story/solarwinds-russia-hackers-turla-malware/,https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2020_na-kaspersky-experts-connect-solar-winds-attack-with-kazuar-backdoor,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/kaspersky-lab-has-been-working-with-russian-intelligence,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/23/kaspersky-lab-security-firm-win-trust-russian-spying-scandal-antivirus,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3205877/kaspersky-lab-denies-leaked-emails-prove-it-has-been-working-with-russia-s-fsb.html,https://www.wired.com/story/solarwinds-russia-hackers-turla-malware/,https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/Russia-cyberattacks-chronology/31002623.html,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/16/891834251/u-s-says-russian-hackers-are-trying-to-steal-covid-19-vaccine-research;RT Falsely Claims No Proof Kremlin is Behind SolarWinds Hack;;;;;;
221;;;;Misleading;Irakli Gharibashvili;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/polygraph-fact-check-georgian-pm-s-distortion-of-the-rose-revolution-legacy/6742826.html;Georgian PM’s Distortion of the Rose Revolution Legacy;2021-02-24;polygraph;;"On February 18, Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia resigned, citing disagreements with his own Georgian Dream party. Gakharia criticized the arrest of opposition party leader Nika Melia, calling it “unacceptable.”Melia was arrested for allegedly violating the terms of his bail while awaiting trial for leading a June 2019 protest outside the parliament building in Tbilisi. This year, Melia has been encouraging the opposition and its supporters to boycott the parliament, claiming last October’s elections were rigged in favor of the ruling party. The opposition leader’s arrest and Gakharia’s resignation have sparked the south Caucasus nation’s most severe political crisis in years.On February 22, former prime minister Irakli Gharibashvili, also a Georgian Dream party member, succeeded Gakharia. In a speech to his party that day, Gharibashvili claimed that Georgia’s 2003 Rose Revolution, which ended the 30-year reign of Eduard Shevardnadze and brought a Western-style government to power, was a bad thing. “People tired of [a] tough decade had hopes for the so-called Rose Revolution, as a result, instead of an imaginary development, we ended up with a ruined economy in a hopeless state,” Gharibashvili said. “We have to remember the torture of people, the violation of human rights, the fateful war with the worst consequences, the loss of territories and the recognition of Abkhazia and Ossetia, which further complicated the possibility of reconciliation with Abkhazians and Ossetians."" This appraisal of the Rose Revolution is highly misleading.Prior to the 2003 revolution, Georgia had suffered from widespread corruption and civil war. Separatists in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, aided by Russia, managed to create their own de facto territories. A third region – Ajara, on Georgia’s Black Sea coast – was also threatening to go the way of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Georgia had been ruled for nearly 30 years by Shevardnadze, who began his career as the head of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic’s Communist party and remained in power after the collapse of the USSR in 1991.What came to be known as the Rose Revolution occurred in November 2003, after protesters contested the results of a flawed election. During the protests, demonstrators gave roses to the soldiers and police guarding the streets and the parliament building. In January 2004, Georgians overwhelmingly voted for protest leader Mikheil Saakashvili to succeed Shevardnadze as president.Saakashvili inherited a dire economic and political situation. Organized crime, corruption and bribery were rampant, especially among the police and customs officials. “You had to pay bribes to accomplish the most simple thing. Policemen were not paid, basically,” Richard Miles, the U.S. ambassador to Georgia from 2002-2005, told the Huffington Post in 2017.“A police or customs officer job was considered a license to steal.” Schools and hospitals were in disrepair and many homes lacked basic utilities like running water and electricity.Saakashvili launched a massive reform program, targeting and firing corrupt public officials and raising salaries for police and other civil servants so they could live on their legitimate earnings. Bureaucracy, which had made life difficult for both local businesses and foreign investors, was reduced, and tax reforms helped increase revenue, drastically increasing the state’s budget.To be sure, Saakashvili’s record in dealing with the country’s separatist movements was mixed. A report on the results of the Rose Revolution one year on, from the independent conflict monitor International Crisis Group, evaluated the new government’s successes and failures in this sphere. Arguably his biggest success was reaching an agreement with Ajara, which fully integrated the region into the Georgian state. Saakashvili also made overtures to Abkhazia, stressing that the breakaway region would be reintegrated peacefully via various incentives. His least successful effort was in reintegrating South Ossetia, and limited fighting broke out between Ossetian and Georgian government troops. Russian mercenaries are suspected to have been involved as well. A five-day war with Russia in August 2008 had disastrous results for Georgia and Saakashvili’s administration. Many observers say that the war began with an attempt by Georgia’s military to seize Tskhinkvali, South Ossetia’s capital. That interpretation, however, ignores the events that led up to the fighting.The road to confrontation began on August 1, 2008, when Ossetian militia blew up a military vehicle carrying Georgian peacekeepers. Georgian forces retaliated, killing several militiamen. That was followed by an escalating series of attacks by both sides, starting with sniper fire and graduating to artillery duels, with weapons increasing in caliber, leading to the outbreak of open hostilities on August 7. Saakashvili declared a unilateral ceasefire on August 7, but South Ossetian forces ignored it and the fighting continued. On August 8, Russia launched a military operation against Georgia, blockading the country’s Black Sea ports and occupying parts of Georgia proper. Russian forces were assisted by allies from Abkhazia. Later in August, Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, and has since maintained a military presence in both.GEORGIA -- A column of Russian armored vehicles seen on their way to the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali somewhere in the Georgian breakaway region, South Ossetia, August 9, 2008.While the results of the conflict were humiliating for both Georgia and Saakashvili, they cannot be blamed entirely on him or the Rose Revolution that brought him to power. Saakashvili had demonstrated with Ajara in 2004 that he could resolve a separatist crisis peacefully, and supported a peaceful, moderate approach to Abkhazia. In the case of the war in South Ossetia, there is credible evidence that Russia, which already had a military presence in the breakaway territories when the war broke out, sought a conflict and encouraged its local allies to provoke the Georgian military into providing a pretext for military action. In any case, Russia moved large numbers of troops and equipment into the region prior to the outbreak of hostilities. Moscow’s hand in Georgia’s territorial woes did not end in 2008. More recently, Russia, with the help of its local separatist allies, has repeatedly moved the breakaway regions’ de facto borders into government-controlled Georgian territory. The process has been referred to as a “creeping occupation.” In sum, the negative developments that followed the Rose Revolution, including Russian trade sanctions and Russia’s invasion, were at least partly caused by Moscow.Meantime, other results were overwhelmingly positive. A thoroughly corrupt system was overthrown, the economy grew from 2005-2019 despite the war with Russia, and poverty was drastically reduced from 30 percent in 2005 to 14 percent by 2019, according to the World Bank. Georgia has enjoyed significant foreign investment since the revolution, and signed a free trade agreement with the European Union in 2014. Prior to 2010, the country was working toward joining NATO as well, and despite not being a member, 11,000 Georgian troops have supported NATO’s mission in Afghanistan over the years.";https://oc-media.org/gakharia-resigns-as-prime-minister-of-georgia/,https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-georgia-political-crisis-giorgi-gakharia/,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4532539.stm,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgias-rose-revolution_b_8638118,https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/georgia/rose-revolution-one-year,http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&tx_ttnews%5Ball_the_words%5D=Georgia%20Moscow%20proxy&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33872&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&cHash=56f9d06976,https://jamestown.org/program/the-russian-georgian-war-was-preplanned-in-moscow/,https://jamestown.org/program/the-goals-behind-moscows-proxy-offensive-in-south-ossetia/,https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2019/02/05/russias-new-strategy-in-georgia-creeping-occupation/,https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/georgia/overview,https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/georgia/,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/it-s-time-to-invite-georgia-to-join-nato/;Georgian PM’s Distortion of the Rose Revolution Legacy;;;;;;
222;;;;Uncertain;Haitham Al-Obeidi;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-corona-uk-strain-children/6742825.html;Iraq Reports Coronavirus Variant ‘More Dangerous’ for Children;2021-02-24;polygraph;;Iraq’s health ministry said emergency room records show that infants died “within an hour” after being infected with the mutated COVID-19 virus, Iraqi news channel Al Sharqiya reported on February 22. A mutated strain first identified in the United Kingdom is more dangerous and infecting age groups that the original virus did not, the ministry said.Earlier in February, the health ministry announced that the strain, called B.1.1.7, was “fast-spreading” in Iraq, including among children.“[T]he new variant of coronavirus is more dangerous for children and young people. In the past two days, we have recorded deaths among infants under a year old with extensive lung damage,” ministry official Haitham Al-Obeidi said.While there is a consensus among experts that the U.K. coronavirus strain is more infectious, its actual risks for children remain under investigation.B.1.1.7 was identified in the U.K. in October 2020. In January, experts there said it might be associated with a higher risk of death than the original virus strain, which first emerged in China. That assessment was based on clinical data presented by four leading British medical institutions: Public Health England, Imperial College London, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Exeter.Nervtag, the U.K.’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, also reviewed the data and concluded that, compared to other variants, B.1.1.7 “appears to have substantially increased transmissibility” and “there is a realistic possibility that infection with VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with the World Health Organization, also said the B.1.1.7 variant spreads more easily and could lead to “potentially more deaths.”British scientists, including those with Nervtag, hinted as early as mid-December that the U.K. variant “has a higher propensity to infect children” and that “children are equally susceptible” as adults.Besides Iraq, health officials in Israel also reported “concerning levels” of infection with the U.K. strain among children and young people, blaming it for “a record, unprecedented” number of people on ventilators. “40% of illness is in children, a higher percentage than their part in the population,” Israeli Health Ministry official Sharon Alroy-Preis said in January. “The strain causes serious symptoms at a 30 percent higher rate,” she said, adding that while getting vaccinated “works against the British mutation … the virus infection rate is much faster than the vaccine rate.”Still, scientists warn that there is not enough data to show that children are more susceptible to the newly identified coronavirus strains. “There is no convincing evidence that any of the variants have special propensity to infect or cause disease in children. We need to be vigilant in monitoring such shifts, but we can only speculate at this point,” said Stuart Campbell Ray, vice chair of Medicine for Data Integrity and Analytics at the Johns Hopkins Medicine.A medical team member takes a swab sample from a child who suffers from cancer to test for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the Children's Hospital for Cancer Diseases in Basra, Iraq July 12, 2020.Iraq is reportedly among the Middle East countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with 672,000 infections and 13,311 deaths as of February 23.To curb the latest spike in infections, Iraq has reimposed a partial lockdown until March 8, instituted a nationwide mask mandate and adopted a workday curfew and total Friday-to-Sunday lockdown.;https://www.alsharqiya.com/en/news/the-iraqi-ministry-of-health-the-mutated-strain-of-corona-virus-is-more-dangerous-than-its-first-counterpart,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1809811/middle-east,https://shafaq.com/en/Iraq-News/Children-die-of-Covid-19-in-Iraq-Health-Official,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55768627,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/961037/NERVTAG_note_on_B.1.1.7_severity_for_SAGE_77__1_.pdf,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html,https://www.who.int/csr/don/21-december-2020-sars-cov2-variant-united-kingdom/en/,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55406939,https://www.timesofisrael.com/mutated-covid-19-strains-are-stymieing-efforts-to-curb-spread-virus-czar-says/,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know,https://www.google.com/search?q=iraq+covid+stats&oq=iraq+covid+stat&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0i20i263j0i390l3.14814j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1809811/middle-east;Iraq Reports Coronavirus Variant ‘More Dangerous’ for Children;;;;;;
223;;;;False;Nicolás Maduro;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-maduros-dissembling-attack-on-leopold-lopez/6742823.html;Maduro’s Dissembling Attack on Leopoldo Lopez;2021-02-23;polygraph;;"At a news conference on February 17, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro claimed that his administration has “20 years of evidence against Leopoldo Lopez for all of his crimes, conspiracies and his fascism.” Except that the purported conspiracies and criminal accusations against Lopez are distortions and falsehoods that rights groups and an academic review have said are politically charged.  National Police members during clashes in an anti-government protest in Caracas, on March 22, 2014. Leopoldo Lopez is an important political figure in Venezuela who has consistently challenged Maduro’s authority and that of predecessor Hugo Chavez. Lopez attended Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and graduated with a master’s degree in public policy. Four years later, he returned to Venezuela and was elected mayor of Chacao municipality. In 2009, Lopez founded the social-democratic “Voluntad Popular,” or Popular Will party. After Venezuela tumbled into an ever-worsening economic crisis prior to Chavez’s death in 2013, and extending into Maduro’s presidency, Lopez emerged as one of the country’s leading opposition figures. He was among those who called for peaceful mass protests in 2014 to force Maduro’s resignation. Maduro blamed the protests on “fascist” groups, and Lopez pressed authorities to release protesters jailed in a police crackdown. ""All of these problems — shortages, inflation, insecurity, the lack of opportunities — have a single culprit: the government,"" Lopez said at the time, as reported by the New York Daily News. Calling the demonstrations ""a moral and patriotic duty,"" he added: ""If we don't do it now, then when? And if it's not us, who will?"" For his actions, Lopez was arrested on an array of criminal charges, including murder (which was dropped). Lopez’s defense argued that he did not call for violence or damage to property; on the contrary, the opposition leader had repeatedly called for peaceful demonstrations. His lawyers said the prosecution was politically motivated and that the court denied all their evidence. In 2015, Lopez was found guilty of public incitement, criminal conspiracy, instigating arson and criminal damage. A judge sentenced him to 13 years and 9 months imprisonment, and he spent three years in the Ramo Verde prison near Caracas before being placed under house arrest. Lopez was given the maximum sentence after the judge ruled that his anti-government messages via social media and public influence were sufficient evidence of his intent to incite violence. In response, Lopez sued Venezuela, and his case was reviewed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The commission unanimously backed his side of the case, expressing “profound concern over the complaints it has received regarding the alleged lack of guarantees to ensure due process in the investigations and prosecutions” of Lopez.Venezuelan officials ignored the commission. But another review of the case, by the Global Freedom of Expression Institute at Columbia University, also sided with Lopez. “Although there is no evidence that the opposition leader’s speech was an incitement to violence, there is evidence that it was a speech opposing the government that strongly questioned the government leaders and called for social mobilization,” the institute said. ""It was, therefore, speech especially protected by international human rights law given its political contents.""  Leopoldo Lopez speaks outside the Spanish embassy in Caracas, on May 2, 2019 While under house arrest, Lopez acted as a mentor to Popular Will politician Juan Guaido, who was elected congressional leader in 2019 and launched a challenge to Maduro’s election victory the prior year. Dozens of countries, including the United States, subsequently recognized Guaido as the country’s interim president. Earlier this year, the European Union withdrew its recognition of Guaido. In October 2020, Lopez fled to Spain, having spent nearly18 months in refuge at the Spanish ambassador’s residence in Caracas after participating in a failed uprising in April 2019. Lopez is continuing his resistance by encouraging the international community to apply sanctions against top Venezuelan officials, a step the EU announced on Monday. In a February 22 interview in Spain with Voice of America, Lopez said he sees an opportunity for change in his country under the new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden. “We today have an important job in the short term, and that is to re-group and strengthen pro-democracy forces,” he said.";https://twitter.com/VTVcanal8/status/1362094598621958146,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/leopoldo-lopez-venezuelan-elite-opposition-guaido ,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/06/recognizing-juan-guaido-as-venezuelas-leader-isnt-a-coup-its-an-embrace-of-democracy-nicolas-maduro-sanctions-icc/, ,https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/dead-fierce-anti-government-protests-venezuela-article-1.1612313 ,https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/el-caso-de-leopoldo-lopez/ ,https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/057.asp,https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/el-caso-de-leopoldo-lopez/,https://www.voanews.com/americas/guaido-ally-under-spanish-protection-forming-shadow-venezuelan-cabinet,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-eu/eu-states-no-longer-recognise-guaido-as-venezuelas-interim-president-idUSKBN29U1A3,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics/venezuelan-opposition-figure-lopez-abandons-caracas-refuge-to-flee-abroad-idUSKBN2790QW,https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-interview/20201127-exiled-venezuelan-opposition-figure-lopez-urges-europe-to-impose-sanctions-on-maduro,https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-eu/eu-hits-19-venezuelans-with-sanctions-over-december-election-idUSL8N2KS575,https://www.voanews.com/episode/venezuelan-opposition-leader-sees-opportunity-change-4586416;Maduro’s Dissembling Attack on Leopoldo Lopez;;;;;;
224;;;;Likely False;Saeed Khatibzadeh;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-iraq-shiite-militia/6742821.html;Iran’s Unconvincing Denial of Ties with Erbil Attackers;2021-02-22;polygraph;;"Late February 15, rockets struck the airport in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan’s capital and the host city for U.S.-led international troops.Fourteen rockets were fired, three of which hit Erbil airport, where the international coalition forces are based. A civilian contractor was killed, and nine others were injured, including a U.S. service member, coalition spokesman Wayne Marotto reported on Twitter.SITE Intelligence Group, an American non-governmental organization that tracks online activity of white supremacist and jihadist organizations, said that a Shiite militia group calling itself “Saraya Awliya al-Dam” claimed responsibility on February 16. SITE translated the group’s name as “Guardians of Blood,” and published the group’s follow-up statement, which said the United States was the main target.Typically for terrorist groups, “Guardians of Blood” made several false and exaggerated statements in claiming responsibility for the attack, including that 24 rockets were launched and struck the coalition base, blasting it “to rubble” and killing American soldiers and a senior officer. Multiple sources have debunked these claims.Verified by reliable sources, videos from Erbil showed that rockets hit civilian neighborhoods. Reuters photographs showed that six of the 10 attack victims were civilians: one was killed and five were injured.Five hours after the attack, Kurdistan’s Interior Ministry said the rockets were fired from a Kia automobile “between Erbil and Gwer,” a small town 18 miles east of the base.“Last night’s attack employed the same method and technique used in a previous assault on the Erbil airport,” the ministry said in a statement. It released photographs showing 107mm Katyusha rocket shells and a launcher with three unlaunched rockets mounted on a destroyed vehicle.Katyusha rockets were used in previous attacks, including the December 2020 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and an October 2020 attack on the Erbil airport. In each of these and other cases, the perpetrators were identified as Iran-backed Shiite militia.Iran's support programs to Iraqi Shiite militia are ""very robust,"" and date back to 1980s, according to the researchers at the Combating Terrorism Center, West Point. Tehran sponsors basic and advanced paramilitary training at camps in Iran and Lebanon, and has been arming proxies with more sophisticated missiles in addition to the militia's ""sizable stockpile of unguided 107mm and 122mm rockets, manufactured both locally and in Iran,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported in 2019. Iran denied any ties with the attack and the group that committed it. “Iran rejects the ‘suspicious rumors’ circulating about the rocket attack that targeted a US airbase in Erbil and condemns ‘suspicious attempts’ to link the incident to the Islamic Republic,” the Iranian state news agency PressTV quoted Saeed Khatibzadeh, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, as saying.Despite Iran’s denials, security sources believe it backs the Guardians of Blood as a cover for its secret operations in Iraq. “Either Iran is responsible for helping to indirectly fund/arm this group, and it is directly responsible for their activities, or the group is merely a cover for the IRGC” (the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Iranian regime’s national security force), Evan Kohlmann, co-founder of the risk intelligence group Flashpoint told Polygraph.info.He added: “An influential former Kataib Hezbollah fighter told me back in August that one of the attacks carried out by Saraya Awliya al-Dam in Mosul – the only attack it has carried out north of Baghdad other than the latest rocket strike in Erbil – was too sophisticated to be the work of Iraqi insurgents and was likely arranged by the IRGC.”Kataib Hezbollah is an Iraqi Shiite paramilitary group.An Iraqi intelligence source told the U.S. government-funded satellite TV channel Alhurra that “the Awliya al-Dam Brigades are a group directly linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard” and “already the vanguard of a selected group of Kataib Hezbollah Brigades, trained to carry out high-quality operations.”The growing list of proxies makes the attacks attribution more difficult and helps Iran in maintaining plausible deniability, the U.S. Institute of Peace reported on January 13.Among other Shiite militias in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq are widely seen as Iranian proxy groups. The U.S. government has designated both as foreign terrorist organizations.";https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/rocket-attack-iraq-kills-coalition-contractor,https://twitter.com/OIRSpox/status/1361581419227734016?s=20,https://twitter.com/siteintelgroup/status/1361698178869964800?s=20,https://twitter.com/BarzanSadiq/status/1361396773663735813?s=20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/16/rocket-attack-us-airbase-iraq-kills-civilian-contractor,https://gov.krd/moi-en/activities/news-and-press-releases/2021/february/statement-by-the-ministry-of-interior-of-the-kurdistan-regional-government-1/,https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/669649#.YCsBv8UOfC4.twitter,https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/shia-militant-faction-guardians-of-blood-claims-4-attacks-on-logistics-convoys-for-us-forces.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26L3LE,https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Iranian-Strategy-in-Iraq.pdf,https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/191211_IranianMissilesIraq.pdf,http://ttps://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/02/16/645399/Khatibzadeh-Iran-Erbil-Kurdistan-Iraq-rocket-attack,https://twitter.com/IntelTweet,https://www.alhurra.com/iraq/2021/02/18/%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85?amp,https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/jan/13/biden-iran-regional-influence-proxies,https://apnews.com/article/57a346b17d6da07ae732ba1437520fd2,https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/bombs-over-erbil/;Iran’s Unconvincing Denial of Ties with Erbil Attackers;;;;;;

That coup, along with the arrest of Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and other civilian leaders, sparked protests across the country.During a February 5 episode of the ""World According to Jesse,” which airs on Russia’s state-funded RT America channel, former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and co-host Brigida Santos discussed events in Myanmar.Santos raised the arrest of Suu Kyi, noting the ousted leader had “defended her country as its predominately Buddhist military committed genocide against Rohingya Muslim minorities on her watch.""She said that the U.S. has been hypocritical in condemning China’s ""alleged genocide” of Uighur Muslims in its northwestern Xinjiang region given “the genocide” of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.""The Trump and Biden administrations have both called China's repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang genocide, but the U.S. has also sanctioned Chinese authorities over the internment of Muslim minorities. And yet Washington is somehow backing Myanmar's leader even though she has been criticized by the international community for her role in the genocide of Muslims,” Santos said.“Hypocrisy always seems to ensue when the government can somehow benefit.”The statement is misleading. The U.S. has sanctioned officials in both countries for their roles in the alleged genocides.U.S. opposition to the military coup in Myanmar and support for civilian governance in general is different than direct support for Suu Kyi or her policies. While it’s true that Suu Kyi has defended Myanmar against genocide accusations at the top United Nations court, she had no control over the military when it launched the brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, which began in late 2016.Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi (C) arrives for the second day of hearings on the Rohingya genocide case before the International Court of Justice at The Hague, The Netherlands, on Dec. 11, 2019.In August 2018, U.N. investigators found that Myanmar’s military had perpetrated unlawful killings, rape and other forms of sexual violence on a massive scale against Muslim Rohingya with “genocidal intent.”The then-U.S. ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said that the State Department's own fact-finding report was ""consistent"" with the U.N. report. However, the State Department avoided the term “genocide” due to the “complexity” of such legal designations, then-State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said.In November 2017, then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said “ethnic cleansing” and “horrendous atrocities” were being carried out against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. He added that those behind the crimes should be “held accountable” and called for targeted sanctions.In November 2018, then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence directly criticized Suu Kyi for the military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. “The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse,” Pence told Suu Kyi during a face-to-face meeting in Singapore.The U.S. has imposed sanctions on those responsible for ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.In August 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it had “sanctioned four Burmese military and Border Guard Police commanders and two Burmese military units for their involvement in ethnic cleansing in Burma’s Rakhine State and other widespread human rights abuses in Burma’s Kachin and Shan States.”In December 2019, senior Burmese military leaders were hit with sanctions for committing “serious human rights abuse against members of ethnic minority groups across [Myanmar], including those in the northern Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States, among others” under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.Among those sanctioned were military chief Min Aung Hlaing (who instigated the recent coup), his deputy Soe Win, and two light infantry division heads whose troops “participated in serious human rights” abuses.In July 2019, the State Department banned those military leaders and their family members from traveling to the United States “for gross human rights violations, including in extrajudicial killings in northern Rakhine State, Burma, during the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya.”On January 19, the outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump formally labeled China’s actions against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang as genocide.Under Biden, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not deviated from that assessment.The U.S. State Department has yet to apply such a designation to crimes against humanity in Myanmar. However, during his Senate confirmation hearing on January 19, Blinken said he would oversee an interagency review to determine whether the actions taken by Myanmar’s security forces against Rohingya Muslims constituted genocide.Members of Congress have been more resolute.In December 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 394-1 to declare Myanmar’s actions against the Rohingya genocide.Following the February 1 coup in Myanmar, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez said the Myanmar military was “guilty of genocide against the Rohingya and of a sustained campaign of violence against Burma’s ethnic minorities.”Meanwhile, U.S. support for Suu Kyi has been more broadly tied to support for democratization in Myanmar. After decades of military rule there ended in 2011, the U.S. lifted comprehensive sanctions in 2012-2013. According to the Associated Press, U.S. officials feared a reintroduction of full sanctions and/or a genocide label could undermine civilian governance and undo the country’s democratic transition.The U.S. has faced criticism for that decision, amid calls for stronger sanctions and a genocide designation to halt the killing.However, Suu Kyi’s alleged role in the genocide is not comparable to that of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang.And unlike the U.S., where the president is the commander in chief, the head of Myanmar’s armed forces is also the commander-in-chief. Suu Kyi, as the State Counselor of Myanmar, had no authority over the commander-in-chief.Rohingya refugee children struggle as they wait to receive food outside the distribution center at Palong Khali refugee camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, on Nov. 17, 2017.Suu Kyi was also constitutionally banned from serving as Myanmar's president, who is the legal head of state and government.The Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Border Affairs, and Ministry of Home Affairs — which collectively handle Myanmar's security forces — are also under the military’s control.Following the July 2019 visa bans on Min Aung Hlaing and others, senior U.S. State Department officials were asked if Suu Kyi or other members of Myanmar’s civilian government would face similar sanctions. One of those officials replied that the military was being targeted because evidence shows that “[t]hey are responsible for the commission of these atrocities.”The U.S. official said that Myanmar’s military, which “stands outside of all civilian control at this point and is a law unto itself,” would ideally be brought under civilian control, advancing democratization in Myanmar.Independent analysts, including Myanmar specialist and journalist Francis Wade, have likewise argued that Suu Kyi should not bear the brunt of genocide allegations.“The security crackdown is a military campaign orchestrated by Min Aung Hlaing, the military chief. He is the person to whom blame should be primarily directed,” Wade told the Council on Foreign Relations.“What is interesting is that the military, as an institution, has essentially engineered itself into a position whereby it can commit such atrocities, but Aung San Suu Kyi takes the blame.”Still, Wade and others have noted that Suu Kyi and the government have defended the military’s actions, prompting what has widely been described as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate’s “fall from grace.”In December 2018, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said both Suu Kyi and Aung Min Hlaing could face genocide charges.";https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/myanmars-aung-san-suu-kyi-charged-illegally-importing-walkie-talkies,https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1053221,https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-weighs-genocide-designation-rohingya-crisis/story?id=57488574,https://apnews.com/article/04fd379ad52d4cc09671e9705c53662e,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/politics/tillerson-myanmar-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing.html,https://apnews.com/article/caa762778be14fe58b0d46474764f811,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm460,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm852,https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/284,https://mm.usembassy.gov/public-designation-due-to-gross-violations-of-human-rights-of-burmese-military-officials/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-pompeo-genocide-uighur/31064113.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-blinken-idUSKBN29W2RC,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-house-designates-myanmar-campaign-against-rohingya-minority-genocide,https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-on-situation-in-myanmar,https://apnews.com/article/04fd379ad52d4cc09671e9705c53662e,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/years-us-pressed-declare-rohingya-crisis-genocide-hold/story?id=72522830,https://2017-2021.state.gov/on-public-designation-due-to-gross-violations-of-human-rights-of-burmese-military-officials//index.html,https://www.cfr.org/interview/how-myanmars-military-wields-power-shadows,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/18/571709258/u-n-human-rights-chief-aung-san-suu-kyi-could-be-culpable-for-genocide;Uighurs and Rohingya: RT America Host’s False Equivalence;;;;;;

Yet, while the search term “vaccine” is now used less on Google, searches aimed at determining the “adverse effects” from COVID-19 vaccines have become the fourth-most-popular on Google worldwide and the most-popular in some African countries.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an “adverse event” is “any health problem that happens after a shot or other vaccine.” The problem “might be truly caused by a vaccine, or it might be pure coincidence,"" the CDC says.Most people are reasonably concerned about the effectiveness and risks of the COVID-19 vaccines because their development has been fast-tracked and they were approved under emergency orders. News of mutations in the original SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19 have added to these concerns. The CDC provides comprehensive information about vaccines, in English and many other languages.Now, “adverse effect” has become a favored term of anti-vaxxers, who are spreading falsehoods and misrepresenting official data.The Trillions Intelligence Network is not the most prominent anti-vax website, but Polygraph.info chose to review one post because it includes several of the popular myths about COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccines and takes U.S. adverse effects data out of context.“COVID Vaccines Kill and Maim Thousands + Ineffective on New Strains of Virus,” which the network published on February 7, has been widely shared on social media networks.The piece repeats debunked coronavirus myths, such as the claim that all existing COVID-19 vaccines are still “experimental” and haven’t passed required clinical trials. That claim has been fact-checked and proven false.Another popular myth is that vaccines do not protect against the new mutations of the virus. That claim has also been investigated; while the vaccines may not be as effective on some new strains, they still appear to provide protection. Furthermore, booster shots could be used to strengthen the vaccines' effect.The article goes on to claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed and maimed “thousands.” As evidence, it cites the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a data portal run by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approves COVID-19 and other vaccines.“As of Jan. 29, the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System shows 501 reported deaths and 10,748 other injuries,” the article says. Those statistics are accurate from the system -- but they give a false impression because Trillions leaves out critical information. The data published on VAERS is from unverified reports; it is raw data collected for analysis later. The CDC says it cannot be used to prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccine and reported adverse health events.Health professionals are encouraged – and vaccine manufacturers required – to report all adverse effects. But anyone can voluntarily share their vaccination experiences via VAERS. The system also provides the public with tools for searching and downloading its data.Searching VAERS on February 11 using the terms “all vaccines” and “covid-19” yielded 11,249 events that were reported as adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccination, including 414 deaths, two brain deaths, 56 cardiac arrests, 28 other types of cardiac failures, and other types of serious or life-threatening complications.Here's the problem: That doesn’t mean the deaths, cardiac arrests, etc., were from the vaccine. As VAERS explains, the system has multiple limitations:The data “may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.”“In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases.”“The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.”The Trillions Intelligence story lists no author. The site’s “About” section says it is published by an “independent and international” group of volunteers. The Trillions Intelligence website does not provide contact information except for an online form that did not work when Polygraph.info attempted to get comment.";"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11j8_9sv06,https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/,https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F054ffx,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/sideeffects/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html,https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-top-covid-19-vaccine-myths/,https://www.trillions.biz/news/168380-COVID-Vaccines-Kill-and-Maime-Thousands---Ineffective-on-New-Strains-of-Virus.html,https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-top-covid-19-vaccine-myths/#placebo,https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-report-top-covid-19-vaccine-myths/#mutates,https://www.today.com/health/experts-explain-vaccine-efficacy-new-covid-19-strains-t207647,https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html,https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html,https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html,https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=BFCF538AF61F8CF9823511B50284,https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html";Anti-Vaxxers' False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccine Deaths;;;;;;

Hardly.;2021-02-11;polygraph;;On February 4, Leonid Volkov, aide to imprisoned Russian dissident activist Alexey Navalny, announced that Navalny’s activist network would be taking a break from organizing mass rallies to focus on September’s parliamentary elections.Speaking during a YouTube live stream, Volkov assessed the results of the protests over Navalny’s incarceration held in cities across Russia in late January, which resulted in thousands of arrests.“If we go out every week, thousands more will be detained, and hundreds more beaten,” Volkov said, as reported by The Moscow Times.“The work of the regional headquarters will be paralyzed, and it will be impossible to work on elections. This is not what Alexey wants from us. Alexey has asked us to concentrate on this autumn.”On February 9, Volkov announced a new protest action will take place on February 14 but will not be a street action. Instead, he asked supporters to stand outside their homes with their phone flashlights on from 8:00-8:15 p.m. Part of the reasoning, according to Volkov, is to avoid direct confrontations with police. But Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova saw something sinister. Zakharova asked rhetorically, via her personal Facebook account:“What happened between February 4 and 9 and forced the ‘opposition’ to radically change tactics? Everything is nice and simple – on February 8, 2021, an online meeting with Volkov and Ashurkov [another Navalny aide] took place at the Permanent Mission of Poland to the EU in Brussels, in which EU countries, the United States and Britain took part. In essence, a meeting of NATO countries.The NATO members instructed the ‘opposition,’ and in fact their agents of influence, how to continue to conduct subversive work ‘more cunningly’.”The assertion that NATO is directing Navalny’s supporters is false.In his February 4 statements, Volkov explained the reasons for calling off mass street actions, specifically the need to preserve activists’ freedom ahead of parliamentary elections. On YouTube, he also explained how the authorities’ recent repression against protesters could scare off many people who have only recently come to support the opposition. He also argued against the idea that the protests should become more radical because it would scare off potential supporters and “legitimize any sort of violence from the authorities.” There was also no contradiction or change in tactics between Volkov’s announcements on February 4 and 9. On February 4, he said they would suspend street actions and instead act “more cunningly.” The phone protest set for February 14 - an idea borrowed from protesters in neighboring Belarus - is not a mass demonstration. In other words, the opposition didn’t “radically change” its tactics after the virtual conference, as Zakharova claimed, but rather stuck to the plans announced on February 4.Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's Chief of Staff, Leonid Volkov speaks during a press conference in Germany, August 2020.Zakharova’s only “evidence” for the claim that Volkov was told to continue protests after February 4 is a screenshot of a tweet from the official Poland in the EU account (@PLPermRepEU), announcing the teleconference with Volkov and Ashkurov.The tweet read: “The recent developments in (EU-Russia) relations require action from the #EU Member States. This is why (Poland) is hosting a virtual meeting with A.@Navalny's closest associates @LeonidVolkov & @Vashurkov. The EU27 PermReps alongside (the US, UK, Canada, and Ukraine) are now discussing the next steps.” The tweet suggests that the “next steps” are the EU countries’ response toward Russia, not instructions or orders for Volkov and Ashkurov. Volkov later reported what was discussed during the conference on his social media accounts.The main topic was new EU sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s close allies.“I see in a number of respected media outlets the phrase ‘sanctions against Russia’ in relation to the package of personal sanctions that Vladimir Ashurkov and I discussed today with representatives of the EU countries, and we will talk a lot further in the coming weeks and months,” Volkov wrote in a Twitter thread about the conference. “These are sanctions against wallets and propagandists, the closest circle and support of Vladimir Putin. These are sanctions in the name of Russia, in its interests. Our goal is to identify and freeze assets consisting of tens and hundreds of billions of dollars stolen from the Russian people.” Volkov’s accusations are in keeping with Navalny’s activism, which for years has consisted of blog and video investigations into luxury properties allegedly belonging to members of Putin’s inner circle. The most recent example, released after Navalny’s return to Russia, was a video investigation into a palatial compound on Russia’s Black Sea coast. The Kremlin has denied that the property ever belonged to Putin, and on January 30, Arkady Rotenberg, a businessman and close associate of Vladimir Putin, claimed to be the real owner of the estate. The previous two official owners also had personal ties to the Russian president.Volkov concluded his Twitter thread by saying that, judging by the Russian Foreign Ministry’s reaction to calls for sanctions targeting the wealth of Putin’s allies and associates, anti-Kremlin activists have hit a sore spot.;https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/02/04/navalny-s-team-suspends-further-protests-until-the-spring-refocusing-on-campaign-efforts-ahead-of-russia-s-fall-parliamentary-elections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4JgcgJvnhA,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/04/navalnys-team-announces-no-more-protests-until-spring-a72839,https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/02/09/navalny-s-associates-announce-protests-planned-for-february-14,https://meduza.io/en/news/2021/02/04/navalny-s-team-suspends-further-protests-until-the-spring-refocusing-on-campaign-efforts-ahead-of-russia-s-fall-parliamentary-elections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4JgcgJvnhA,https://news.sky.com/story/alexei-navalny-ally-calls-for-courtyard-light-protests-to-avoid-russian-police-crackdown-12213382,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/09/russia-annoyed-by-eu-inclusion-of-navalny-allies-in-sanctions-talks-a72870,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55872249,/a/31072058.html;Are the US and EU Running the Navalny Protests?

Now He Rejects Vaccines.;2021-02-10;polygraph;;"The year 2021 has seen advances in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Since January, vaccines have been rolled out in more than 60 countries, according to Our World in Data. But in Tanzania, the president not only opposes vaccination, he denies the country has had COVID-19 cases. On January 27, President John Magufuli said, without evidence, that “vaccinations are dangerous.” He added that “if white people were able to come up with vaccinations, a vaccination for AIDS would have been found, a vaccination for tuberculosis could have eliminated it by now; a Malaria vaccine would have been found; a vaccination for cancer would have been found by now.” Magufuli also insisted that, because of God, “[Tanzanians] have lived for over one year without the virus … even right here there is no one who is wearing a mask,” and that the health ministry “should be cautious, over the health of all Tanzanians and avoid the temptation to turn us into a country where vaccination trials are conducted freely.” His claims that vaccines are dangerous, and that Tanzania has been COVID-19 free, are false.  Vaccines for everything?  Vaccines are used to train the immune system to fight diseases, but they are not straightforward. AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and cancer are all caused by different problems (parasites, viruses, DNA mutations, bacteria), with different complexities. No vaccine has been developed for AIDS. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is used against tuberculosis, but its impact on the transmission of the disease has been limited. As the World Health Organization (WHO) states, the BCG vaccine “does not prevent primary infection and, more importantly, does not prevent reactivation of latent pulmonary infection.” A more recent vaccine, the RTS,S, is used against malaria. It, too, partially protects against the disease. The WHO began recommending it in 2016, and the vaccine was first introduced on a large scale in 2019. Vaccines exist to prevent diseases that can cause cancer, like human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis. But a universal vaccine against cancer is “biologically impossible,” as Maurie Markman, the president of Medicine & Science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, told the Cancer Treatment Centers of America in 2018. ""There can't be a vaccine for cancer because cancer isn't a single entity. It's thousands of different conditions,"" Markman said.  A nurse fills a syringe with a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, in Madrid, on February 4, 2021. The speed with which the major COVID-19 vaccines have been developed has aroused skepticism over their safety. However, they have undergone multiple tests before being authorized for distribution. In the U.S., the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines received Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but still had to meet rigorous safety standards and prove their effectiveness in multiple clinical trials. Following Magufuli’s remarks, the WHO’s regional director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, urged Tanzania “to ramp up public health measures such as wearing masks to fight #COVID19.” “Science shows that #VaccinesWork and I encourage the government to prepare for a COVID vaccination campaign,” she tweeted. Tanzania’s government has encouraged citizens to choose home or herbal medicines and maintain personal hygiene rather than get vaccinated. In May, the president said Tanzania was planning to acquire an herbal cure from Madagascar. Polygraph.info has fact-checked COVID-Organics, a drink derived from artemisia annua (an antimalaria ingredient) and other medicinal herbs, which Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, launched in April. The drink has not prevented the coronavirus from taking hold in Madagascar. During a Tanzanian health ministry press briefing in early February, an official demonstrated how to make a ginger, onion, lemon and pepper smoothie, and claimed, with no evidence, it would help prevent contracting COVID-19, the BBC reported. A local doctor speaking anonymously told the BBC that the government’s message that a “vegetable mixture, which has nutritional benefits, is all they need to keep coronavirus at bay” is bogus.  A man washes his hands with chlorinated water at the Mabibo market in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on April 16, 2020. COVID-19 denial  Tanzania's president denies that the country has been hit significantly by the coronavirus pandemic. The government hasn’t reported any new COVID cases since late last April, when it recorded 509 cases and 21 deaths. Since last year, Magufuli has repeatedly stated that God “removed” the virus from the nation, the Associated Press reported. On January 27, Magufuli claimed the country has been coronavirus-free for over a year “because our God is able, and Satan will always fail and will be defeated in various illnesses.” News reports tell a different story. In April 2020, three members of Tanzania’s parliament died from unknown causes over several days, which led opposition party members to call for the parliament to be suspended and its members to be tested, along with their staff and families, Al Jazeera reported.The following month, Magufuli dismissed the head of Tanzania’s national laboratory, which is in charge of COVID-19 testing. Since then, he has continued to insist the pandemic doesn’t exist in the country, Foreign Policy magazine reported. “The sources we’ve been talking to say some of their colleagues and family members have passed on because of COVID-19, but this week they are saying that talking about COVID in Tanzania is a taboo,” Emmanuel Makundi, the editor of Radio France Internationale’s Kiswahili service, told the Africa Calling podcast. Makundi said deaths have spiked, “but neither the government nor the families are officially confirming it was due to coronavirus.” As the BBC wrote, several Tanzanian families have quietly mourned the deaths of family members they suspect died of COVID-19. Most wouldn’t speak to the BBC for fear of government retribution. In early February, Zanzibar’s first vice president, Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad, from the opposition party ACT Wazalendo, admitted to being hospitalized after contracting COVID-19. According to the Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen, he was “the first person to declare his Covid-19 status in Tanzania since April 29, 2020.” Despite his announcement, Zanzibar authorities said they were unaware of his situation, the newspaper wrote. (Zanzibar, an autonomous region of Tanzania, is an island off the country’s Indian Ocean coast.) One indicator of the spread of coronavirus is the number of Tanzanians testing positive when they cross the border. “Ugandan and Zambian officials say they are seeing large numbers of Tanzanian travelers testing positive when they try to cross the border,” The Wall Street Journal recently reported. “Rwanda is denying entry to Tanzanian truckers. Countries as far away as Denmark say they have detected the more-contagious coronavirus strain that first emerged in South Africa in test samples from people arriving from Tanzania.” After the reports from Denmark in January, Magufuli accused Tanzanians traveling abroad of “importing a new weird corona,” the BBC reported. Last May, the president also dismissed COVID test kits, claiming they were faulty and had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw fruit, Reuters reported. “There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation,” Magufuli said. The day before Magufuli’s January 27 remarks, leaders of the Catholic Church in Tanzania broke their silence and issued an alert about a surge in suspected COVID-19 cases. The secretary of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference told the BBC that there has been a rise in the number of funeral services in urban areas. “We were used to having one or two requiem masses per week in urban parishes, but now we have daily masses. Something is definitely amiss,"" he said.";https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XJbDk3QD0c,https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/hiv-vaccines,https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-and-policy-standards/standards-and-specifications/vaccines-quality/bcg,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292#:~:text=Gardasil%209%20is%20an%20HPV,is%20exposed%20to%20the%20virus,https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2018/01/cancer-vaccines-do-exist-but-dont-expect-the-impossible,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#Safety,https://twitter.com/MoetiTshidi/status/1354717233155624963,https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/tanzania-does-not-have-plans-to-procure-covid-19-vaccine-3276326,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52519853,https://www.polygraph.info/a/madagascar-president-promised-miracle-coronavirus-cure-it-didnt-work/30790469.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/tanzania,https://apnews.com/article/fcaaa816cd9ba159c840b5366107da50,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/2/tanzania-opposition-mps-to-boycott-parliament-after-3-mps-die,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/18/will-covid-19-kill-democracy/,https://amp.rfi.fr/en/africa/20210204-tanzania-rejects-covid-19-vaccines-promotes-herbs-despite-spike-in-deaths-africa-health-john-magufuli,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680,https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/zanzibar-s-first-vice-president-maalim-seif-hospitalised-after-claims-of-testing-positive-for-covid-19-3275624,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tanzania-shunned-lockdowns-now-its-rejecting-covid-19-vaccines-11612364606,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680],https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tanzania/president-queries-tanzania-coronavirus-kits-after-goat-test-idUSKBN22F0KF,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/27/tanzania-president-denounces-covid-vaccines,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680;Tanzania’s President Rejected Coronavirus Reality.

As the coup was unfolding, the U.S. State Department condemned it.""@POTUS & @JohnKerry agreed all parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected Gov't of Turkey, show restraint, avoid violence,” the U.S. State Department tweeted on July 15, 2016.In its response to Soylu’s February 4 accusation, the U.S. State Department noted that Washington condemned the coup attempt as it was taking place.  “The United States had no involvement in the 2016 attempted coup in Turkey and promptly condemned it,” it said in a February 4 statement.“Recent assertions to the contrary made by senior Turkish officials are wholly false.”In July 2016, then-U.S. President Barack Obama also condemned the attempted coup and expressed support for Turkey’s democratically-elected government.“All parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,” he said. Obama also telephoned Erdogan to voice support for Turkey’s legitimate government and offer U.S. assistance in investigating the coup’s origins. The White House reported that Turkey had requested the extradition of Islamic scholar Fettulah Gulen, head of the international Gulen organization, which Erdogan blamed for the coup.The U.S. refused to extradite Gulen, citing a lack of evidence. The exiled political dissident, who was an ally of Erdogan and his party until 2013, has lived in the United States since 1999. Gulen accused Erdogan of staging the 2016 coup himself to justify purging the military and state structures. In December 2017, the Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of former CIA operative Graham Fuller, claiming he’d met with coup plotters on the evening of July 15, 2016, as the coup attempt was underway.Fuller responded on his personal blog with a solid alibi: “On the night of the coup attempt in Turkey last year I happened to have been addressing a group of 100 people or so right here in the town in western Canada, where I have been living for the past 15 years.” He noted he had not been in Turkey for five years.Since Turkey was formally proclaimed a secular republic in October 1923, the military has repeatedly intervened to exert control over the civilian government. Over two decades in power, Erdogan has sought to re-assert Islamic values while consolidating autocratic power in the presidency, sidelining opponents and jailing journalists. On July 15, 2016, military officers and enlisted men loyal tried to overthrow Erdogan’s government by launching simultaneous attacks in several major cities, including Istanbul and the capital Ankara. An estimated 241 people were killed and 2,194 injured in the ensuing fighting, during which civilians (including Erdogan opponents) rallied against the rebel military troops.A host of European and non-European nations also condemned the coup attempt.";https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/5/turkish-minister-says-us-behind-2016-failed-coup-newspaper,https://www.state.gov/response-to-turkish-statements-on-the-2016-attempted-coup-in-turkey/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/turkish-government-post-coup-purge-widens,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-13503361,https://grahamefuller.com/why-did-turkey-issue-an-arrest-warrant-against-me/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/7/16/timeline-a-history-of-turkish-coups,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/7/15/turkeys-failed-coup-attempt-all-you-need-to-know;Turkish Interior Minister Falsely Blames US for 2016 Coup;;;;;;
230;;;;False;Tatmadaw, Myanmar armed forces;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-myanmar-coup/6742788.html;Myanmar Military: This Coup Is Not a Coup;2021-02-02;polygraph;;"On February 1, the military in Myanmar staged a coup, taking control over the country.Known as the Tatmadaw, the armed forces seized Myanmar’s infrastructure, and suspended media, telephone and internet services as well as financial institutions and international flights. Simultaneously, the Tatmadaw detained civilian leaders and announced the transfer of legislative, judicial and executive powers to army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.Military Commander-in-Chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.The military-owned Myawady TV station claimed on February 1 that the takeover was justified because the government did not act on the Tatmadaw’s rejection of last year’s election results, which it claimed were fraudulent.The army-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party overwhelmingly lost the November 8 elections to the ruling National League for Democracy Party (NLD). Observers said there were a few minor irregularities but nothing that would affect the lopsided outcome.Soldiers stand guard on a street in Naypyidaw on February 1, 2021, after the military detained the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the country's president in a coup.Responding to international condemnation of the military takeover, the Tatmadaw issued a statement saying there was no coup – just a move to protect democracy:“The Tatmadaw categorically denies it is impeding Myanmar’s democratic transition,” the military’s statement said, while “urging some diplomatic missions not to make unwarranted assumptions about the situation.”In fact, by taking over the country, the Tatmadaw is impeding the post-election transition on dubious constitutional authority.A Tatmadaw order published on Myawady TV’s web portal declared a nationwide one-year state of emergency it claimed was “in accordance” with Myanmar’s constitution, citing Articles 417 and 418. “[I]t is the Tatmadaw’s undeniable duty to exercise Article 417 of the Constitution to declare ‘State of Emergency’… to utilize Article 418, which mandates the transferring of ‘Legislative, Judicial and Executive Powers’ to the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Services.”But that is questionable. According to the constitution, the authority to take emergency actions belongs to Myanmar’s president, not the military.Article 417 states: “If there arises or if there is sufficient reason for a state of emergency to arise that may disintegrate the Union or disintegrate national solidarity or that may cause the loss of sovereignty, due to acts or attempts to take over the sovereignty of the Union by insurgency, violence and wrongful forcible means, the President may, after coordinating with the National Defense and Security Council, promulgate an ordinance and declare a state of emergency.”Article 418 states: “In the matter concerning the declaration of the state of emergency according to Section 417, the President shall declare the transferring of legislative, executive and judicial powers of the Union to the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Services to enable him to carry out necessary measures to speedily restore its original situation in the Union.”According to local and international media reports, Myanmar’s President U Win Myint did not invoke Articles 417 and 418. In fact, he was detained by the military along with State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader, and other National League for Democracy officials.“It is outrageous that the military interprets the 2008 Constitution as they wish,” Bo Kyi, Secretary of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners NGO in Myanmar, told the Voice of America. He said there was no significant political instability in the country that would justify the military moving to declare a state of emergency.In this photo taken March 30, 2016, Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi and military chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing arrive for the handover ceremony at the presidential palace in Naypyidaw.Myanmar, previously known as Burma, gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948, but remained under military control for decades after its army staged a first coup in 1962. In 1988, Suu Kyi, the daughter of an independence hero, returned from exile and started a democratic movement. The ruling junta killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and put Suu Kyi under house arrest.The military refused to hand over power after the Suu Kyi-founded National League for Democracy Party won elections in 1990. In 1991, Suu Kyi was awarded a Nobel Prize for her democracy efforts. In 2010, after nearly two decades, she was freed from the house arrest. Suu Kyi won a seat in the parliament two years later, and in 2015 her party won Myanmar’s general elections. Still, the military drafted a constitution that bars Suu Kyi from the presidency and gives significant power to the army.By Tuesday (February 2), news reports from Myanmar confirmed the detention of hundreds of lawmakers and activists across the country. Suu Kyi is back under house arrest. It is unknown if she is allowed to communicate with the outside world or her fellow politicians inside Myanmar.""Prominent activists were also arrested. My mother was arrested at home in Myeik at 5:30 in the morning. There are police patrols and military security personnel deployed throughout Myeik,"" Bo Kyi of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners told VOA’s Burmese service. His mother, Daw Yee Yee Cho, planning and finance minister for the Tanintharyi Region in Myanmar's south, was arrested along with the entire regional cabinet, Bo Kyi said.Soldiers stand guard at a Myanmar's military checkpoint on the way to the congress compound in Naypyitaw, February 1, 2021.The National League for Democracy expressed hope for a peaceful solution. A party lawmaker and former political prisoner, Bo Bo Oo, told the Associated Press news agency that the party is not currently planning street protests, but is exploring legal options to take power back from the military.“We are working to settle the problem peacefully,” he said. “Right now, we are not planning for a big protest. But we have to practice some form of civil disobedience.” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday (February 1) that the United States would immediately review sanctions on Myanmar and take ""appropriate action,"" following the recent developments. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Myanmar’s military leadership to resolve any differences through peaceful dialogue.

231;;;;False;Aleksander Lukashenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-lukasheko-belarus-nato-blitzkrieg/6742785.html;Lukashenko Falsely Claims West Planned Belarus ‘Blitzkrieg’ To Topple Him;2021-02-01;polygraph;;"During a January 28 meeting with government officials, Belarus President Aleksander Lukashenko compared the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests with recent nationwide demonstrations in Russia following the arrest of opposition leader Alexey Navalny.Lukashenko said law enforcement had kept Belarus from falling into “the abyss of another color revolution.”Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko attends a meeting with top officials in Minsk, Belarus on January 26, 2021.The term color revolution was widely adopted in the ex-Soviet space after the 2004-2005 Orange Revolution against widespread election fraud following the November 2004 presidential runoff in Ukraine. Orange was the color chosen by then presidential challenger and pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko for his election campaign; he was running against pro-Russian incumbent Viktor Yanukovych.The protest movement resulted in the initial runoff results being annulled. Yushchenko then won a second runoff, becoming president in January 2005 and ending the Orange Revolution.Belarus, Russia and others portray “color” revolutions as protest movements fomented by the West with the aim of destabilizing or overthrowing the governments of target states. “We have suppressed the most vivid manifestations of protest activity,” Lukashenko said, adding: “The difference between the Belarusian and Russian events, you’ll see, there may be several. But the main difference in our case, [they] decided to carry out a blitzkrieg in August. Instantly overthrow the government, or at least show that the government has fallen, and bring in NATO troops.“Russia will be rocked for a long time. They understand perfectly well that it is impossible to carry out a blitzkrieg in Russia.”Lukashenko’s assertion of outside orchestration is false. There is no evidence that Western governments staged protests in Belarus or planned to send in military forces.However, Western powers have supported free and fair elections in Belarus, as well as civil society efforts in the country.Opposition to Lukashenko’s 26-year rule, which has become increasingly authoritarian during a time of global pandemic and economic decline, has grown into widespread public protest.Women wearing carnival masks march carrying umbrellas with the colors of the former white-red-white flag of Belarus to protest against the August 9, 2020, presidential election results in Minsk, Belarus on January 26, 2021.Most of the violence during six months of protests has been perpetrated by Belarusian state authorities.Young people in particular have joined the opposition to Lukashenko’s rule. In an online ZOiS survey conducted among 2,000 Belarusians aged 18–34 from June 22 to July 4, 2020, only 10 percent said they had planned on voting for Lukashenko during the August 2020 presidential election.About 80 percent of respondents said they planned to vote. Another 20 percent said they knew someone who had protested in the past year.On August 9, 2020, the Belarusian presidential election was held after five days of early voting. That evening, protesters took to the streets when state TV claimed Lukashenko had won 80 percent of the vote.The Associated Press interviewed election workers who said they saw ballot fraud or were pressured to falsify results in favor of Lukashenko.The following weekend, up to 200,000 people marched against Lukashenko in Belarus’ capital Minsk — a large number in a city of roughly 2 million. The BBC estimated that only 4,000 to 5,000 people attended a pro-government counter-demonstration.An independent journalist who spoke to National Public Radio noted the protesters had come from “all walks of life, including students, technology workers, small business owners and factory workers.”""There is no sense of radicalization among these protesters,"" the journalist said. “It’s sort of a united front of social discontent.”Indeed, in August hundreds of state television employees went on strike to protest what they called a rigged presidential poll. Factory workers and students also launched nationwide strikes to get Lukashenko to step down.Elderly people also took part in the protests, with one person saying that the presence of older citizens seemed to curb police violence. There were also reports of police officers quitting despite facing legal repercussions.Lukashenko was nonetheless sworn in for his sixth term on September 23. In November, an expert report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe “found the presidential election fell short of fulfilling the basic international requirements for genuine elections.”The European Union has sanctioned Belarusian officials for repression and election falsification. The U.S. has also sanctioned Belarusian officials for their roles in the fraudulent presidential election and subsequent violent crackdown on peaceful protesters.Following the election, tens of thousands of people were arrested during a series of weekend demonstrations. From August 9-12, riot police detained an estimated 7,000 protesters and bystanders, “holding them in inhuman and degrading conditions, and torturing and otherwise ill-treating hundreds,” New York-based Human Rights Watch reported.One thousand people were detained during a peaceful protest in November.Rights groups have reported unlawful use of force, torture and even state-backed killings.Law enforcement officers detain two men as opposition supporters protest against police violence and the August 9, 2020 Belarus presidential election results in Minsk, Belarus on November 29, 2020.The minimum number of people injured by police during August and September was 1,373 people, according to a report released by Mediazona, a Russian media outlet, in conjunction with Open Democracy. That report relied on documents leaked form Belarus’ Investigative Committee.Detainees have been subjected to beatings and electric shocks. Belarusian police have also reportedly sexually assaulted those detained at protests. Opposition leaders have shared images on social media they allege are of “concentration camps” being set up for protesters. The reports appear to be corroborated by leaked audio recordings obtained by Radio Free Europe, in which a senior Belarusian Interior Ministry official can be heard discussing plans for a barb wire enclosed internment camp for demonstrators.The same security official can be heard instructing security forces to use excessive force against demonstrators.Another leaked audio recording obtained by the EU Observer appears to confirm that Lukashenko gave a green light to assassinate political opponents and journalists abroad.Lukashenko has previously accused neighboring states of seeking to annex Belarusian territory, while also baselessly claiming a NATO invasion was being planned. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has also blamed the U.S. for recent protests in Russia.";https://www.rferl.org/a/30810092.html,https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/belarus/overview,https://en.zois-berlin.de/publications/zois-spotlight-2020/belaruss-presidential-election-an-appetite-for-change/,https://apnews.com/article/international-news-ap-top-news-europe-72e43a8b9e4c56362d4c1d6393bd54fb,https://www.voanews.com/europe/hundreds-thousands-march-belarus,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/903036245/one-week-after-election-belarus-sees-giant-protests-against-europe-s-last-dictat,https://apnews.com/article/19a30818da3804ae2b5c55ef45e7c2ff,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/17/903205824/belarus-factory-workers-walk-out-joining-mass-protests-calling-for-president-to-,https://www.rferl.org/a/signing-off-belarusian-journalists-walking-off-the-job-amid-election-protests/30784413.html,https://apnews.com/article/riots-alexander-lukashenko-belarus-europe-aad694eb9636d03b1c85016c4cd4194c,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/08/13/my-conscience-is-clear,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/2/b/469539.pdf,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/10/02/belarus-eu-imposes-sanctions-for-repression-and-election-falsification/,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1143,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1222,https://www.hrw.org/node/377550/printable/print,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/11/belarus-more-than-1000-people-arrested-in-a-single-day-of-peaceful-protests-amid-escalating-repression-of-rights/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/leaked-police-data-reveals-level-violence-against-protesters-belarus/,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/09/17/this-case-is-real,https://www.rferl.org/a/leaked-belarusian-audio-points-to-plan-for-barbed-wire-bound-camp-for-protesters/31052734.html,https://euobserver.com/foreign/150486,https://www.polygraph.info/a/lukashenko-belarus-poland-annexation/30984199.html,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-police-violence-spotlight-3-105903891.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLzRnazJReWdqeFM_YW1wPTE&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKq_ZunBZjhsBHbYbq20iKIfm7EiqD3B1RCBydPVPtR4cPp3ZVQh7PbMQjnswFtPVdfeStWnvn7x9Bi41MX7klCDSaB1faQ1ln5I9LgtYpLt8hjyWKSAPzmibtTc4k1alaoA2PdFMaa1iY-oeCCWVCi30VNaWQgo3isR9zI2lSiP;Lukashenko Falsely Claims West Planned Belarus ‘Blitzkrieg’ To Topple Him;;;;;;

Other outlets in Ukraine and Russia quickly picked up the same story.The problem is that it's false: Kravchuck's words were taken out of context.In referring to an “interstate issue” and the “state” level, Kravchuk was talking about Ukraine and Russia, not Ukraine and the Donbas oblasts (administrative regions), where Russia incited a separatist conflict in 2014. The Trilateral Contact Group, which meets in Minsk, Belarus, was created in 2014 to provide a forum for dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. It is composed of delegates from Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).Although separatist representatives have advanced proposals via the group, they are not official participants in the Trilateral process and don't represent states.Kravchuk's views on that point are further underscored by an interview with RBK-Ukraine on January 21.In the interview, Kravchuk complained that Russia was deliberately blocking progress on prisoner exchanges. Further, he said that representatives from Russia’s proxy states “act at the talks like participants, although they are just invitees.”“Thus, through the back door … they did everything to make our Trilateral Contact Group a five-sided one,"" Kravchuk added.Similarly, the “Normandy format” talks Kravchuk referred to are the informal negotiations that have been held since June 6, 2014, when representatives of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine discussed the Donbas issue while attending the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.The two ""separatist republics” in Donbas have never been included in these talks, just as they are not official participants in the Trilateral Contact Group.In his RBK-Ukraine interview, Kravchuk was criticizing a proposal to arrange a prisoner exchange with Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch who is a personal friend of Vladimir Putin. In 2019, the leaders of the DPR and LPR released four people their forces held. The release was purportedly made at Medvedchuk’s request.But when Kravchuk brought up detainees in the quote cited by Newsone, he'd already made clear that states -- not individuals -- should be involved.Here is what Kravchuck said that Newsone left out:“And the [prisoner] return is peculiar – not to Ukraine, but to the mediator Medvedchuk. We do not know such a thing for a private person to perform the functions of a state. We stated that this is an interstate issue, and states should study the issue and resolve it at the state level in accordance with international law and within the framework of the Normandy format.” Other Moscow-leaning media outlets had similar omissions. On January 29, Kravchuk announced that he had rejected the latest proposal to exchange prisoners via the mediation of Medvedchuk. ""The swap did not happen and it would not happen the way it is proposed,"" Kravchuk said. ""There is an established and proven procedure for an exchange. And this shall be done at the level of the state rather than individuals.""So, Kravchuk was not referring to Russia's proxies in Donbas as states. It’s not the first time Moscow-leaning media in Ukraine misrepresented Kravchuk’s words. In 2016, some outlets reported that Kravchuk suggested Crimea had never been Ukrainian, and that it couldn’t possibly return to Ukrainian control. (Russia annexed Crimea by force in 2014, garnering international condemnation.) In reality, Kravchuk was saying the relationship between Crimea and the central government in Kyiv could not be the same as what it was before the 2014 annexation. Leonid Kravchuk was the first president of Ukraine after the country achieved independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. He served in the office until 1994. On December 8, 1991, Kravchuk, along with Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, signed the Belavezha Accords that ended the Soviet era.";https://www.unian.info/war/kravchuk-russia-deliberately-trying-to-block-donbas-talks-11293220.html,https://rubryka.com/ru/2021/01/17/takogo-shhe-ne-bulo-kravchuk-prokomentuvav-skandalnu-zayavu-bojovykiv/,https://zik.ua/ru/blogs/kravchuk_priznal_dnr_i_lnr_otdelnymi_gosudarstvami_993344,https://www.unian.info/war/donbas-kravchuk-says-ukraine-not-to-transfer-hostages-through-mp-medvedchuk-11303159.html?fbclid=IwAR17TsUplrzJER--2FjTnVnuU8X_5P3pv1meSUlw3ng__93e8sDbdncx2J4,https://www.stopfake.org/ru/fejk-kravchuk-nazval-ukrainskij-krym-nerealnym/;In Ukraine, Pro-Moscow Media Turn a First President's Words Upside Down;;;;;;

Two of the former detainees quoted in the piece talked about their experiences. The first said that after being influenced by religious extremism, he went to the center at the request of his family – and that without it, he might have fallen into crime. He also denied reports of slave labor:""We have never heard of people being forced to pick up cotton when they were in or after graduating from the training centers. With such advanced technology, manually picking cotton is not necessary. I don't know how this was fabricated.""The second “trainee” is quoted as saying: ""Some overseas media smeared and attacked Xinjiang with very ugly and extremely irresponsible words. Look at me, I'm so open-minded and happy now. Do I look like I have been abused? If my liver and kidney were removed, would I have the strength to build such a happy family? Can I still be like this cheerily communicating with you guys? Do not tell lies any more, please!""Although it is not possible to disprove their personal accounts, there is extensive and compelling evidence Uighurs have been maltreated – so much that Polygraph.info determined the article to be misleading.  CHINA – Workers walk by the perimeter fence of what is officially known as an education centre in Dabancheng, on September 4, 2018. China has consistently denied abusing Uighurs and frames the camps and other policies as an effort to assimilate them and prevent terrorism. Some of the most compelling evidence to the contrary comes from Adrian Zenz, one of the world’s foremost scholars on the People’s Republic of China, who has written extensively about the Uighur’s situation. Zenz has provided detailed accounts of forced labor, sterilization and torture.Leaked internal Chinese government documents, known as the “Karakax List,” showed the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party was targeting Uighurs. The Associated Press reported that of 484 people detained in camps in Xinjiang’s Karakax county, 149 were for exceeding official birth quotas, “the most common reason for holding them.”In December 2020, a report prepared by Zenz analyzed government documents and state media reports and concluded that “hundreds of thousands of ethnic minority laborers in Xinjiang are being forced to pick cotton by hand through a coercive state-mandated labor transfer and ‘poverty alleviation’ scheme.” The scheme is supposed to be part of the government’s efforts to eradicate poverty, but, as the report shows, evidence points to targeting and coercion of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities: ""Since recruitment is the most crucial aspect of labor transfer, the state combines its sophisticated and fine-grained security apparatus with a set of intrusive social control mechanisms in order to maximize the labor transfer mobilization not only of Uyghurs and Kazakhs in Xinjiang, but also of Tibetans in the Tibet Autonomous Region. These mechanisms are a key reason why labor transfer employment constitutes coercive labor.""​These labor programs “are frequently written about in [Chinese] state media as glowing examples of the government assisting millions of poor people into work, but those articles also contain clues to their coercive nature,” the Guardian reported. Publications often include references to “changing thoughts and behavior” and “policies discouraging illegal religious activities,” according to the newspaper.Polygraph.info has previously reported on Uighur issues, including China’s denial of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and the forced sterilization of Uighur women in detention centers. Multiple news organizations interviewed Uighur women who’d been detained for re-education and said they were forced to have abortions or had contraceptive devices forcibly implanted. In September 2020, a Polygraph.info fact check about Chinese officials' denial of the existence of detention centers noted that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s “Xinjiang Data Project” had identified 380 sites across the Xinjiang region, with about half being categorized by the institute as higher-security tiers. As Polygraph.info wrote in July 2020, The New York Times’ “Xinjiang Papers” and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ “China Cables” exposed government documents that revealed internal procedures for “dealing” with the Uighurs – for example, by telling detainees’ family members that their relatives had been “poisoned” with “unhealthy” Islamic extremism and would be “cured” in these camps.China has admitted to the mass detention of Uighurs but repeatedly insisted that the camps are “job-training centers” that have “nothing to do with human rights [or] religion.”";https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1214195.shtml,https://www.jpolrisk.com/karakax/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=1bf107f177c74e6a374534a5b67f318bd3c20654-1593419000-0-AarOWg7fOY15RU81T9S4iyxxdRuWk_gcXH3o3btoqCg12v3VFqb4dsrbQakV_ifhZbEBMSoBxSdiESh1_vWLp_4swN7WQYjrY53t29JrQcYBK2v0UHgy8Fzo8FkYvXmvSTnwZfKOEcoG--U27mBxY4DS73KHW6aW-NisulkwRGWLBlE6ZRzIrOz-08BGdJrdFtYbj8doa6FZq1DT8c-Ls2V6En8CqQhzKz2YjOWzhz3hFwlS7hhxCnAG9_CrPFoqz5VfIBpaKYCfv14nc0a2P7qTkbdOvqIYz8KuASXqWD7q,https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c,https://cgpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201214-PB-China-Zenz-1-3.pdf,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/15/xinjiang-china-more-than-half-a-million-forced-to-pick-cotton-report-finds,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-pompeo-genocide-uighur/31064113.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-cites-misleading-stats-to-deny-uighur-sterilization-campaign/30829478.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/abortions-iuds-and-sexual-humiliation-muslim-women-who-fled-china-for-kazakhstan-recount-ordeals/2019/10/04/551c2658-cfd2-11e9-a620-0a91656d7db6_story.html,https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-as-new-uighur-detention-facilities-emerge-china-denials-and-disinfo-persist/30864997.html,https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-uighurs-fact-check/30748659.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html,https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/,http://au.chineseembassy.org/eng/sgxx_10/dsxx/dsjh_1/t1726547.htm,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/china-xinjiang.html;China Showcases ‘Happy’ Uighurs to Fend Off Genocide Claims;;;;;;

The US Embassy (Again);2021-01-29;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for the nationwide demonstrations on January 23, when thousands took to the streets across Russia protesting Alexey Navalny’s arrest.Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent opponent, was arrested two days earlier in Moscow immediately after returning from Germany, where he’d recovered from a near-fatal poisoning.Navalny and the investigative website Bellingcat accused Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, of planning and carrying out the poisoning using the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny’s supporters in Russia called for protests, while some local authorities refused to grant protestors permission to assemble. Still, thousands took to the streets in more than 100 cities and towns across Russia, demanding freedom for Navalny and challenging Putin’s presidency. Riot police detain a protester during January 23, 2021, rally for Navalny.Photos and videos showed riot police breaking up the demonstrations, attacking journalists, beating elderly and young protesters alike, and dragging scores of detainees into police cars. By the end of the day, the police had arrested some 3,600 protesters.Governments and rights organizations worldwide condemned the Russian authorities for brutalizing the protesters and for Navalny’s arrest, and they urged the Kremlin to immediately release all prisoners.Amid the international outcry, Russia homed in on one voice – that of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.In a series of press statements, social media posts and interviews, Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused the embassy of interfering in Russia’s internal affairs and inciting violence using social media.The claims are false: None of the embassy’s posts encouraged violence.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow maintains official Russian language accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and the Russian social network vKontakte.Polygraph.info could find no messages or statements regarding the arrest of Navalny, the protests or the riot police brutality, or anything related to Russia’s political or human rights affairs, on embassy accounts on Facebook, Instagram and vKontakte – either before, during or after the protests. On January 23, the embassy sent out five tweets on its Russian-language Twitter account reacting to Navalny’s arrest and the demonstrations.The first tweet was a Russian-language summary of a statement made by the U.S. mission at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe demanding freedom for Navalny.The second tweet, translated from the Russian, stated: “We are following the reports about the protests in 38 Russian cities. More than 350 peaceful protesters and journalists have been detained. The U.S. supports the right of all people to protest peacefully, to freedom of expression. The measures taken by the Russian authorities are directed at suppressing these rights.” The third tweet, translated from the Russian, reads: “The Russian authorities are arresting peaceful protesters and journalists. Seemingly, this is a coordinated campaign to suppress freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. In recent years, repressive actions against civil society, independent media and the political opposition have continued in Russia.” The last two tweets were a summary and translation of a statement made by the U.S. State Department: “The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists in cities throughout Russia.” As can be seen, nowhere in the posts did the embassy encourage violence. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed the U.S. Embassy used its website to “coordinate” the protests by posting the times and places of the planned demonstrations.In fact, the embassy website post that Zakharova called a “manual for the protesters” was the standard travel alert that U.S. diplomatic missions abroad issue to warn American visitors of potential hazards.“The priority of the U.S. Mission to Russia is the security of U.S. citizens in Russia, and that it is our responsibility to provide available information to them on potential security risks. This is the standard consular practice of many countries’ diplomatic missions,” the embassy told Polygraph.info.Zakharova’s claim that the U.S. Embassy coordinated the protests ignores the fact that the times and places of planned protests along with detailed instructions were distributed via numerous websites, social platforms and messenger applications, run by Navalny supporters, hours before the embassy alert was sent.On January 28, a court in Moscow rejected an appeal for Navalny’s release from custody and ordered him to be held for 30 days. Facing multiple charges and potentially years in prison, Navalny has dismissed all the allegations against him as “absurd” and politically motivated.Navalny’s supporters announced that the nationwide rallies will continue while he remains in jail. The next round is scheduled to take place this weekend.;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-blames-us-for-fuelling-protests-triggered-by-alexei-navalny-arrest-w99wtp3wk,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny/navalny-anticipating-arrest-planned-protests-to-force-kremlin-to-release-him-ally-says-idUSKBN29R0RX,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fsb-fails-damage-control-of-navalny-s-phone-call-/31025420.html,https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/putin-vs-navalny-can-russias-protesters-prevail?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3smABhCjARIsAKtrg6JJhgpdmEH5FLfj0wZQhsA-Moe_B2E0b5dO9WOXIB3XX8pKai8OblEaAqeAEALw_wcB,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-arrested-poisoning-law/31053008.html,https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4538756,https://twitter.com/usembru,https://www.facebook.com/russia.usembassy,https://www.instagram.com/usembru/,https://vk.com/usembru,https://twitter.com/USApoRusski/status/1352937888158261249?s=20,https://osce.usmission.gov/the-detention-of-the-russian-opposition-politician-aleksey-navalny/,https://twitter.com/USEmbRu/status/1352965613535207429?s=20,https://twitter.com/USEmbRu/status/1352989847246393345?s=20,https://twitter.com/USApoRusski/status/1353078192593137665?s=20,https://twitter.com/USApoRusski/status/1353107149933727745?s=20,https://www.state.gov/protests-in-russia/,https://www.facebook.com/maria.zakharova.167/posts/10225189933485108,https://ru.usembassy.gov/demonstration-alert-u-s-mission-russia-5/,https://t.me/s/apologia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-appeal-idUSKBN29X1MZ,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-extremism-investigation/30988860.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/27/navalny-supporters-calls-for-fresh-protests-across-russia;Russia’s Scapegoat for Nationwide Protests?

Medical workers and family members recounted horror scenes, including patients dying of asphyxiation despite desperate efforts by doctors.  The governments of President Jair Bolsonaro and Amazonas were blamed by the opposition, experts and some Brazilians. The crisis fueled a new impeachment request for Bolsonaro. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government announced it was providing oxygen to mitigate the Manaus crisis. On January 15, Bolsonaro defended his administration, saying, “We’ve done our part.” His vice president, Hamilton Mourao, blamed a new virus strain. Health minister Eduardo Pazuello cited the rainy season and lack of ""early treatment"" of hydroxychloroquine – a disproved therapy – as causes. Bolsonaro’s sons said the situation was outside the federal sphere of responsibility and used social media to spread claims that their father’s administration was not at fault. These claims are misleading. Polygraph.info analyzed some of the assertions.  Gravediggers at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, on January 17, 2021. Jair Bolsonaro  Critics argue that Bolsonaro has consistently minimized the dangers of the virus since the beginning of the pandemic and failed to lead a coordinated response to fight its spread in Brazil. He has undermined lockdown and business closures orders and pushed for unproven treatments. Last year, two health ministers left their posts amid disagreements with the president about isolation measures and the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. His current health minister, an army general who specializes in logistics, has no experience in health care. After the Manaus breakdown, health experts and other officials disputed Bolsonaro’s assertion that “we’ve done our part."" They argue that under Brazil’s constitution, the federal government is responsible for coordinating the country’s Unified Health System (SUS). Vanja Santos, one of the board members of the National Council of Health, told the Brasil de Fato newspaper that the lack of a coordinated national plan to fight COVID-19 left local administrators to cope on their own. “[Those] depend on a joint logic – the same that guides the [SUS], which operates in a tripartite manner, involving the (federal) Union, states and municipalities,” she said. “One situation led to another.”  Relatives of COVID-19 patients gather to buy oxygen and fill cylinders at a private company in Manaus, on January 15, 2021. After the January 14 events, Brazil's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, the Amazonas Public Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Public Defender's Office, and the State Public Defender's Office jointly declared: “The federal government is directly responsible for what happens in Manaus,” along with the state government. They filed a civil lawsuit asking Bolsonaro’s government to immediately present an oxygen supply plan for Amazonas and reactivate oxygen factories in the state. Critics allege the government was aware of the dire situation and failed to act swiftly. On January 15, a day after the Manaus situation made international headlines, Amazonas' public prosecutor confirmed Bolsonaro's Ministry of Health had been alerted of the imminent lack of oxygen. ""The state did not prepare for this. And if that wasn't enough, the Ministry of Health's logistics department only met today to deal with this, after being notified four days ago,” he told Epoca magazine. At least four days before January 14, Pazuello was warned about critical oxygen shortages “by members of the government of Amazonas, by the company that supplies the oxygen, and even by a sister-in-law who had a family member 'without oxygen for the day.' Pazuello was also informed about logistical problems in shipments,” according to Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. On January 17, Bolsonaro's government admitted to the Supreme Court that the health ministry knew of the critical oxygen scarcity in Manaus hospitals. Folha de Sao Paulo also published a January 19 article reporting that a team inside SUS, convened by the health minister to act in Manaus, detected and documented in detail the oxygen crisis in hospitals. That included an accurate prediction of when the supplies would run out. SUS reports from January 8 through January 13 show the moment when oxygen went to reserves in hospitals, how medical teams refrained from measuring saturation of patients to prevent detecting the need for already scarce oxygen, and the obstacles of opening new beds in a federal university hospital given lack of resources, Folha de Sao Paulo reported. The minister has “detailed information from a group of technicians, summoned to act on an urgent basis. They visited health facilities daily,” the newspaper wrote. Despite this information, the ministry transported insufficient quantities of oxygen to Manaus. The Brazil Attorney General’s Office gave Pazuello 15 days to explain why.  President Jair Bolsonaro and Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello attend a ceremony to launch the Genomas Project at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, on October 14, 2020. Eduardo Pazuello  In a live stream with the president on January 14, the health minister said that the lack of early treatment was a factor in the Amazonas situation. He also continued to assert that “early treatment” with debunked or unproven medications, such as hydroxychloroquine (a malaria drug) and ivermectin (an anti-parasite medication), “proved effective in all cities and states in Brazil.” On the same day, the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases (SBI) posted on Twitter that it “does not recommend early treatment for COVID-19 with any medication (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, nitazoxanide, corticoid, zinc, vitamins, anticoagulant, rectal ozone, or chlorine dioxide),"" because to date ""randomized clinical studies with existing control groups have shown no benefit and, in addition, some of these drugs may cause side effects.” In a trip to Manaus just days before January 14, Pazuello also stressed early treatment. Folha de Sao Paulo reported that the health ministry “set up and financed a task force of doctors defending what they call ‘early treatment’ of COVID-19 to visit Units Basic Health in the Amazonian capital,” and pressured Manaus city officials to distribute medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to patients. Amandia Sousa, a researcher from the Fiocruz Amazonia public health research center and member of the Brazilian Association of Public Health (ABRASCO), told Polygraph.info the idea of early treatment has become ingrained in people in Amazonas because of disinformation efforts. “Ivermectin is something you don't find in pharmacies anymore,” Sousa said. (In the United States, the National Institutes of Health said hydroxychloroquine does not help COVID-19 patients and that there is not enough evidence to recommend ivermectin.) President Jair Bolsonaro speaks at the inauguration ceremony of Eduardo Pazuello as health minister while holding a box of hydroxychloroquine, on September 16, 2020. Eduardo and Flavio Bolsonaro  Two of Bolsonaro’s sons, Flavio and Eduardo, have argued the federal government did not cause the Manaus situation. Flavio Bolsonaro retweeted a post from the presidential Communications Department about emergency resources being sent by the Armed Forces to show that Bolsonaro's government had left no one behind, “even when responsibility for the problem has absolutely nothing to do with the federal sphere.” Eduardo Bolsonaro also tweeted a “reminder” to his Twitter followers about a Supreme Court decision affirming the right of local authorities to address the pandemic. The April Supreme Court ruling, however, never removed the federal government’s legal responsibility of coordinating the country’s health care system. The ruling made clear that the federal government should still make decisions to contain the pandemic on a national level, including coordinating measures between states and municipalities. The ruling came after Bolsonaro attempted to override local decisions, particularly when it came to lockdowns, social distancing, and commerce restrictions.  Supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro protest against quarantine and social distancing measures imposed by governors and mayors and demand military intervention (AI-5) in Brasilia, on April 19, 2020. Hamilton Mourão and Amazona’s governor, Wilson Lima  Brazil’s vice president, Hamilton Mourao, spoke about the situation on January 15, saying “there was no way to predict what would happen in Manaus with this new strain [of coronavirus].” Amazonas Governor Wilson Lima also noted the new strain, which is believed to have originated in the state. The strain was first reported in January 2021 after Japan identified it in four Brazilians travelers. But health researcher Sousa told Polygraph.info a worrisome trend became apparent in September 2020, before the new virus strain was discovered. “We had a steady period between July and early September. After that, we see a constant increase [in numbers], and yet there was a strong argument that prevailed in the city that there wouldn’t be a second wave,” Sousa said. One of Sousa’s colleagues, who analyzes the genome of coronavirus strains, did not observe mutations in the virus until December 2020. ""Even if there wasn't a new strain, we would still have an explosion [in the system], because there was this trend, which is exponential,” Sousa said. Manaus had its first health care system breakdown in May. In the months that followed, Sousa said citizens did not take enough precautions and authorities did not take enough measures to contain the virus and prevent a second wave. ""The lack of oxygen was the cherry on top of all the lack of planning. There wasn't preparation after the tragedy in May. Of course, you cannot change the entire system, but there could have been at least acknowledgments of previous failures,"" Sousa said. A state of normality was fueled by a study suggesting that after the crisis in April and May 2020, Manaus had reached herd immunity (when enough people are infected and become immune to a disease, which makes its further spread unlikely).As of January 20, Brazil had reported nearly 211,500 deaths in the pandemic, including nearly 4,400 in Manaus. The city reported 200 deaths per 100,000, nearly double the national rate.";https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-manaus/manaus-brazil-hospital-system-collapsing-oxygen-lacking-in-covid-surge-minister-idUSKBN29J2Y0,https://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2021/01/14/pacientes-e-medicos-relatam-colapso-em-manaus-leia-relatos.ghtml,https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/brasil/2021/01/4900450-brasileiros-culpam-negacionistas-pelas-mortes-por-covid-19-em-manaus.html,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2021/01/oposicao-decide-entrar-com-novo-pedido-de-impeachment-de-bolsonaro-por-crise-em-manaus.shtml,https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2021-01-17/venezuela-anuncia-envio-de-oxigenio-a-manaus-mas-governo-nao-confirma-recebimento.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFeCok_ot50,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbBvuXlNWjE,https://www.vox.com/world/21273709/brazil-coronavirus-indigenous-people-covid-19-amazonas,https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3082699/coronavirus-brazils-bolsonaro-eggs-huge-crowd-lockdown,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-covid-coronavirus.html,https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/A-Paratrooper-General-Is-Brazils-New-Health-Minister-20200516-0004.html,http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l8080.htm,https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2021/01/15/conselho-de-saude-aponta-responsabilidade-do-governo-bolsonaro-em-crise-de-manaus,http://www.mpf.mp.br/am/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-am/mps-e-defensorias-publicas-entram-com-acao-para-garantir-oxigenio-em-hospitais-do-amazonas,https://epoca.globo.com/guilherme-amado/procurador-do-am-diz-que-ministerio-da-saude-foi-alertado-quatro-dias-antes-sobre-falta-de-oxigenio-24839277,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/01/governo-bolsonaro-ignorou-alertas-em-serie-sobre-falta-de-oxigenio-em-manaus.shtml,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/01/governo-bolsonaro-diz-ao-stf-que-saude-sabia-desde-o-dia-8-sobre-escassez-de-oxigenio-em-manaus.shtml,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2021/01/forca-nacional-do-sus-detectou-oxigenio-na-reserva-leitos-fechados-por-falta-do-insumo-e-previu-colapso-em-manaus.shtml?utm_source=mail&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=compmail,https://br.noticias.yahoo.com/chuva-e-falta-tratamento-precoce-010000425.html,https://twitter.com/SBInfectologia/status/1349856405612859397,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2021/01/com-manaus-sem-oxigenio-pazuello-montou-e-financiou-forca-tarefa-para-disseminar-cloroquina-em-ubss.shtml,https://www.abrasco.org.br/site/noticias/posicionamentos-oficiais-abrasco/nota-de-solidariedade-a-populacao-do-manaus/55482/,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/hydroxychloroquine-does-not-benefit-adults-hospitalized-covid-19,https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/statement-on-ivermectin/,https://twitter.com/FlavioBolsonaro/status/1349889054213615616,https://twitter.com/BolsonaroSP/status/1350261434131886082,https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/04/08/governo-federal-nao-pode-derrubar-decisoes-de-estados-e-municipios-sobre-isolamento-decide-ministro-do-stf.ghtml,https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/brasil/2021/01/4900568-nao-tinha-como-prever-o-que-ocorreria-em-manaus-com-essa-cepa-diz-mourao.html,https://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2021/01/15/governador-do-amazonas-diz-que-demanda-de-oxigenio-em-manaus-aumentou-5-vezes-em-15-dias.ghtml,https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2021/01/12/fiocruz-confirma-nova-cepa-do-coronavirus-no-amazonas,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-variant/japan-finds-new-coronavirus-variant-in-travellers-from-brazil-idUSKBN29F08R,https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2020/09/22/estudo-preliminar-sugere-que-manaus-pode-ter-alcancado-imunidade-de-rebanho-contra-a-covid-com-66percent-da-populacao-infectada.ghtml,https://covid.saude.gov.br/,https://susanalitico.saude.gov.br/extensions/covid-19_html/covid-19_html.html;Brazilian Leaders Deflect Blame as COVID-19 Overruns Hospitals in Amazonas;;;;;;
236;;;;False;Sergey Lavrov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-arrested-poisoning-law/6742765.html;Russia’s FM Calls Outcry Over Navalny Arrest ‘Unlawful,’ Sidestepping His Poisoning;2021-01-19;polygraph;William Echols;"On January 17, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny returned to Russia nearly five months after being poisoned with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok in the Russian city of Tomsk.Navalny’s flight from Berlin to Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport, where a large crowd of supporters and journalists had gathered, was diverted to the Russian capital's Sheremetyevo Airport for what the airline called “technical reasons.”Navalny was subsequently detained at passport control over alleged parole violations related to a 2014 fraud conviction he has called “politically motivated.” The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled the conviction in the so-called Yves Rocher case “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”The ECHR further demanded Navalny and his business partners be compensated, as Russia denied their right to a fair trial.However, Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) said the fact that Navalny was “undergoing rehabilitation procedures” after being airlifted to Germany for treatment was no justification for missing a parole hearing.On January 18, a makeshift court in the Moscow suburb of Khimki ruled that Navalny must remain in custody until February 15. Another court will then determine whether Navalny will be forced to serve a suspended, 3 1/2-year sentence in the fraud case.Navalny called the proceedings a mockery of justice, and told Russian citizens to take to the streets, not for him, but for “themselves and their future.”Amnesty International labeled Navalny a “prisoner of conscience.”Following criticism from American and European politicians, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of using the Navalny case “to distract public attention from the existential crisis they live in.”""The Navalny case acquired a foreign policy tone artificially, I would say, and completely unlawfully,” Lavrov said. That is false.Police detain a protester with a placard reading 'Freedom for Navalny' at a demonstration in support of Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny in St.Petersburg, Russia, on 18 January 2021.A state-sanctioned assassination attempt using a military-grade chemical weapon would constitute a serious breach of international law. The European Union and UK have already sanctioned six individuals, including Alexander Bortnikov, who heads Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, and Sergei Kiriyenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s deputy chief of staff. Russia has steadfastly denied any involvement in the poisoning, which was confirmed by lab tests conducted under the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and others. The move to arrest Navalny, and not those responsible for his poisoning, prompted calls for additional sanctions.Lavrov claimed Moscow had not been shown proof of Navalny’s poisoning.“[Navalny says] ‘I was poisoned by the Russian state and personally by Vladimir Putin,’ and this is unquestionably taken in by the West, and the West only presents us with facts that Navalny himself spells out in debriefings with German law enforcement agencies,” Lavrov said.On October 6, 2020, the OPCW confirmed the poison used was from the Novichok group, which the Soviet Union developed. German, French and Swiss labs reached the same conclusion. Lavrov has tried to cast doubt on that evidence by accusing the OPCW of being “privatized” by the West.Russia has long demanded that Germany hand over biomaterials, examination results and test samples from the Navalny poisoning case. Russia maintains that without those materials, there is no basis to open a criminal investigation into Navalny’s poisoning. Germany’s Defense Ministry refused to share this information directly, arguing it is unnecessary since Russia belongs to the OPCW.German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said the OPCW was best positioned the deal with the case, as the issue was “not a bilateral German-Russian problem,” the Associated Press reported.This picture taken on April 20, 2017 shows the entrance of OPCW (The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) in The Hague.“This is about a crime that took place in Russia with a chemical nerve agent that is internationally prohibited — the OPCW is the logical point of contact,” Seibert said.Germany recently gave Navalny’s interrogation protocols to the Russian government, after which a German justice ministry spokesman said Moscow had all of the necessary information to carry out a criminal investigation into the poisoning, including blood, clothing and tissue samples, Deutsche Welle reported.Meanwhile, media reports suggest Russian authorities directed the attempted assassination.First, an investigation jointly conducted by UK-based investigative website Bellingcat and Russia’s investigative website The Insider, in cooperation with Germany’s Der Spiegel and CNN, revealed links to Russia’s security services.That investigation uncovered telephone metadata and call records linking would-be FSB assassins to employees of Russian institutes involved in Soviet-era nerve-agent programs.Information gleaned from passenger manifests helped Bellingcat determine that FSB operatives from a clandestine unit specializing in work with poisonous substances traveled alongside Navalny to Tomsk, where the opposition leader was exposed to Novichok on August 19. Mobile phone data bots placed the mobile device of one FSB operative within the range of a tower not far from the hotel where Navalny was staying on the day he was poisoned.The investigative team determined that members of that same FSB unit had traveled alongside Navalny on more than 30 overlapping flights since 2017.On December 21, Bellingcat released a video recording of a phone call in which Navalny posed as “Maxim Ustinov,” a fictional aide to Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Navalny called to a mobile phone listed as belonging to FSB operative Konstantin Kudryavtsev. Bellingcat’s investigation named Kudryavtsev as a member of the FSB squad tasked with poisoning Navalny and cleaning up the evidence.Kudryavtsev answered Navalny’s questions, demonstrating what appeared to be inside knowledge of the poisoning operation. Apart from confirming key details of Bellingcat’s investigation, Kudryavtsev said that the chemical agent Novichok used in the operation had been applied to a pair of Navalny's underwear. Kudryavtsev said that his task was to clean traces of the substance from Navalny’s belongings.Meanwhile, Lavrov compared the Navalny case to the poisonings of Alexander Litvinenko, and of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, likewise alleging “zero facts” had been provided to Russia.Litvinenko a former KGB and FSB officer, died of radiation poisoning in Britain in 2006. A British public inquiry found that his murder was an FSB operation “probably” approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Skirpals were hospitalized in critical condition after being exposed to a Novichok variant. In the Skripal case, two British citizens unconnected to the Skripals were also poisoned. One of them, Dawn Sturgess, died as a result.British and independent investigations identified three likely suspects, all Russian nationals believed to be military intelligence officers. As with Navalny’s case, Russia officially denied any involvement and spun out multiple other explanations.";https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/17/as-it-happened-navalny-returns-to-russia-a72635,https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22languageisocode%22:[%22ENG%22],%22documentcollectionid2%22:[%22JUDGMENTS%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-177665%22]},https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/10/17/european-court-orders-russia-to-compensate-navalny-brothers-over-yves-rocher-fraud-a59291,https://fsin.gov.ru/news/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=539305&sphrase_id=1427524,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-navalny-detained-hearing-improvised-court-mocks-justice/31050116.html,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/russia-aleksei-navalny-becomes-prisoner-of-conscience-after-arrest-on-arrival-in-moscow/,https://tass.ru/politika/10482911,https://apnews.com/article/international-news-moscow-poisoning-europe-russia-70653fd30cc4fa2a83fe2ec072a67175,https://www.reuters.com//us-russia-politics-navalny-baltic/lithuania-calls-for-sanctions-against-russia-after-navalnys-arrest-idUSKBN29M0MP,https://tass.ru/politika/10482911,https://tass.com/politics/1246033,https://tass.com/politics/1246055,https://apnews.com/article/health-moscow-russia-chemical-weapons-vladimir-putin-bfd626650d8260f606246900a9d78ff2,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-sends-alexei-navalny-transcripts-to-moscow-in-poisoning-probe/a-56250997,https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-navalny-bellingcat-poisoning/31008117.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fsb-fails-damage-control-of-navalny-s-phone-call-/31025420.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35370819;Russia’s FM Calls Outcry Over Navalny Arrest ‘Unlawful,’ Sidestepping His Poisoning;;;;;;
237;;;;Unsubstantiated;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-sputnik-coronavirus-vaccine/6742761.html;Putin’s Baseless Brag About Russian COVID-19 Vaccine;2021-01-15;polygraph;William Echols;"On January 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a nationwide inoculation against COVID-19 with the Russian-manufactured Sputnik V vaccine.He claimed that Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) provides the best protection and safety compared to any other coronavirus vaccine worldwide. ""The Russian vaccine — it is now completely obvious, and now the actual application shows that it is, overall the best one worldwide,"" Putin said.Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the government via teleconference call at Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, Russia, on January 13, 2021.""No other preparations of a similar kind demonstrate such a level of protection and such a degree of safety.”Putin’s claims are unsubstantiated.There is as yet no evidence that Sputnik V provides better protection and safety than other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, which killed nearly 2 million people within a single year.In a regular drug approval process, the scientific evaluation and assessment of its efficacy, safety, potential flaws and side effects can take years.With the pandemic death toll rising, the World Health Organization allowed manufacturers to accelerate the study and assessment stage and expedite vaccine rollouts right after final clinical trials. Putin’s claim cannot be verified because long-term data is not available.Some two dozen countries began vaccinations in mid-December, and more than 32 million people globally received doses of one of the several vaccine versions available by mid-January, according to the tracking site Our World in Data.While Russia was the first country to approve its vaccine in August 2020, reportedly prior to completing its final clinical trial phase, mass vaccinations did not start until December.Sputnik V is a two-shot vaccine delivered with three weeks between doses.Sputnik V developer Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology said that 22,714 people had volunteered for the Sputnik V clinical trial by December, and its efficacy rate was 91.4 %. (Efficacy measures the percentage of reduction in cases of disease compared to a group that did not receive a vaccine.)A man receives a Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a clinic in Belgrade, Serbia on January 13, 2021.Meanwhile, the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases showed a 94.1% efficacy rate in its final phase 3 clinical study, which involved 30,000 participants. The vaccine proved 100% effective against “severe” COVID-19, Moderna said.The BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine boasted 95% efficacy in a study involving 43,661 participants.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine AZD1222 proved to be 70.4% effective, according to the results of a peer reviewed study based on a trial of 11,636 participants. The BBC reports that figure could be “as high as 90% by tweaking the dose.”The so-called “Oxford jab” is also cheaper and easier to store, making it better suited for global distribution.China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccine has reported widely varying results, with efficacy rates ranging from 50.4% to 91.25% depending on the trial.Most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines require two shots. Johnson & Johnson is set to roll out a single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March.The company is seeking efficacy rates exceeding 90%, and phase 3 clinical trial data for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected by late January.Another selling point of vaccines is their storage temperatures. AZD1222, for example, can be stored at refrigerator temperature of 2-8°C.The Pfizer vaccine by contrast, needs to be stored at -70°C, although Pfizer says it can be stored at 2-8°C for up to five days.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden receives his second dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at ChristianaCare Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, U.S. on January 11, 2021.The Moderna vaccine may be stored at temperatures between -25°C and -15°C.While the frozen version of the Sputnik V must be stored at -18°C, production of a freeze-dried version that can be stored at 2-8°C is expected to ramp up next month.Cost is also an issue.Sputnik V is set to sell for $10 per dose. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also $10 per dose, but only requires one shot. The Pfizer vaccine is sold for $19.50 per dose, while the Moderna vaccine price ranges from $25-$37 per dose.The Sinovac Biotech vaccine has previously been administered for $60 in China. However, one Indonesian pharmaceutical firm contracted to buy the Chinese-made vaccine said it would cost $13.60 per dose.The Oxford vaccine, by contrast, is priced at $3-4 dollars per dose.In the U.S., the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are initially paid for by the government and are free to U.S. citizens. The U.S. government has also signed a contract to buy up to 300 million doses from Astrazeneca to be provided at no cost to U.S. citizens.Sputnik V is also being provided to Russian citizens free of charge. When administering the Sinovac vaccine in October 2020, local health officials in the Chinese city of Jiaxing declined to comment on whether the cost was being subsidized.A nurse holds the China’s SinoVac coronavirus potential vaccine for trials before administering it to a volunteer at Emilio Ribas Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 30, 2020. Picture taken July 30, 2020. REUTERS/Amanda PerobelliRussia’s decision to fast track the vaccine was criticized by scientists around the world. It also slowed foreign acceptance of the vaccine, with Belarus becoming the first state outside of Russia to register it on December 21, 2020.Russian state media chalked up skepticism to “sour grapes.”However, Russians, too, have been skeptical about Sputnik V. Polling data from December 23, 2020, showed that only 38% of responders planned on getting vaccinated, despite inoculation being free. As of January 13, 1.5 million Russians — just over 1% of the population — had been vaccinated.While the results of Sputnik V phase 1 and phase 2 trails have been published in the British medical journal Lancet, a comprehensive scientific paper on the larger phase 3 trial results has not been released.The Sputnik V phase 3 trial will run until May and cover 40,000 participants.The Gamaleya Institute described Sputnik V as “one of the top 10 vaccine candidates on the list of the World Health Organization, approaching the end of clinical trials and the beginning of mass production.”";https://tass.com/society/1244351,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html,https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30402-1/fulltext,https://sputnikvaccine.com/newsroom/pressreleases/the-sputnik-v-vaccine-s-efficacy-is-confirmed-at-91-4-based-on-data-analysis-of-the-final-control-po/,https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study#:~:text=Statements%20%26,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55040635,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55642648,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-johnsonjohnson/update-1-jj-covid-19-vaccine-on-track-for-march-rollout-still-aims-for-1-bln-doses-this-year-exec-idUSL1N2JO2M6,http://ttps://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-interim-phase-1-2a-data-published-in-new-england-journal-of-medicine,https://www.jnj.com/innovation/questions-about-johnson-johnson-investigational-covid-19-vaccine,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55040635,https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/covid_19_vaccine_u_s_distribution_fact_sheet,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-russia-vaccine-transp/exclusive-russia-focuses-on-freeze-dried-vaccine-doses-as-transport-fix-idUSKBN27W170,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55212787,https://www.cms.gov/covidvax-provider,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-vaccine/sinovac-coronavirus-vaccine-offered-by-chinese-city-for-emergency-use-costs-60-idUSKBN2710UQ,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02386-2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-belarus/belarus-registers-sputnik-v-vaccine-in-first-outside-russia-rdif-idUSKBN28V0ZG,https://www.polygraph.info/a/skepticism-not-sour-grapes-defines-west-s-reaction-to-sputnik-v/30792379.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rusisia-vaccine-sputnik-interest/2020/12/10/005917fa-3702-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-putin/putin-orders-mass-coronavirus-vaccinations-in-russia-from-next-week-idUSKBN29I1JD,https://sputnikvaccine.com/rus/about-vaccine/;Putin’s Baseless Brag About Russian COVID-19 Vaccine;;;;;;

Lawmakers were evacuated and the Capitol was placed on lockdown for several hours. Five people died in the unrest, including one woman – a Trump supporter who was fatally shot inside – and a Capitol police officer who later died from injuries sustained in the melee.Brazil’s largest conservative radio station, Jovem Pan, covered the events, including on its 6 p.m. show “Os Pingos nos Is” (The Dots on the I’s). Toward the end of the show, Olavo de Carvalho, a self-proclaimed philosopher viewed as President Jair Bolsonaro’s intellectual guru, was interviewed on the storming of the U.S. Capitol.However, during his half hour interview, which has recorded more than 1.3 million views on YouTube alone, Carvalho spoke little about the events that were unfolding at that moment in Washington, D.C. Instead, he spread the same disinformation about election fraud that fueled the storming of the U.S. Capitol in the first place.Carvalho’s many false or misleading statements included the claim that fraud actually occurred in the U.S. presidential election, that Joe Biden has Parkinson’s disease, that Kamala Harris works for the Chinese government, and that China and Iran, among other countries, were behind Biden's candidacy.Polygraph.info examined three of Carvalho's assertions. Supporters of U.S. president Donald Trump argue with supporters of President-elect Joe Biden in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 2020. “Everything in this election has been fraudulent.” Carvalho started off his interview by saying: “The first thing we have to acknowledge is that the existence of fraud [in the 2020 U.S. presidential election] is absolutely undeniable. The number of scientific studies that have been done in respect to it prove that the election of Joe Biden is impossible. How can you compare one candidate to another that can’t gather 50 people on the streets?” The assertion that fraud cost Trump the election is false.Trump’s legal team and Republican allies filed numerous lawsuits disputing the results of the November 3 presidential election, and alleging fraud, but most were dismissed by state and federal judges Between November and December 2020, NBC News tracked down the status of 40 Trump legal challenges to the election in different states. It reported that “most of them have been shot down or withdrawn, and no court has found even a single instance of fraud.”USA Today quoted Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who joined Biden’s campaign team in September 2020 , as saying that 61 of the 62 state and federal lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies have failed. The dismissals were either “for lack of standing” or “based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations.”The newspaper also noted that these rulings were made by “both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by Trump.” On November 12, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement saying that “the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” Trump subsequently fired the agency’s leader, Christopher Krebs, an act that prompted bipartisan criticism.In the state of Georgia, Biden’s narrow percentage win over Trump led to two recounts –a hand recount ordered by the state and a formal recount requested by the Trump campaign. Both confirmed Biden’s victory. Trump rejected the recounts, going as far as calling Georgia’s secretary of state – a fellow Republican – and urging him to “find"" enough votes to change the results in his favor, the Washington Post reported.Trump’s actions over the past two months, culminating in the events on January 6, led him to become the first U.S. president impeached twice. On January 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a historic impeachment resolution that was supported by 10 of the body’s 211 Republican members.Polygraph.info previously fact checked U.S. election fraud claims made by Rodrigo Constantino, a prominent Brazilian commentator, who repeated claims made by President Trump and his legal team (including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and lawyer Sidney Powell) and Republican party members. President-elect Joe Biden speaks during a news conference at The Queen in Wilmington, Delaware, on November 16, 2020. Joe Biden “has Parkinson’s disease.” Olavo de Carvalho, who lives just outside Washington, D.C., in Virginia, claimed that “no one knows” Biden and that the president-elect “has Parkinson’s disease.”That is false and one of many claims that Trump and his campaign, some members of the Republican Party and some conservative news outlets made about Biden’s health and mental fitness during the presidential campaign.Biden has never been diagnosed with Parkinson’s or dementia. In a December 2019 medical history assessment, Biden’s personal physician concluded that he is a “healthy, vigorous 77-year-old.”Most of the claims about Biden’s mental acuity stem from his sometimes-halting speech pattern, after a lifelong struggle with stuttering. He is still fighting the speech disorder, as writer John Hendrickson – who also stutters – documented in The Atlantic. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stand with spouses after delivering election victory remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on November 7, 2020. Kamala Harris “works for the Chinese government.” Carvalho’s assertion comes from the work of Trevor Loudon, a New Zealand author and contributor to the Epoch Times, a far-right newspaper known for its pro-Trump stance, conspiracy theories and links to Chinese dissidents. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called Loudon a far-right conspiracy theorist.“[Loudon] made a video about Kamala Harris, and it’s very impressive. She’s not democratic left, she’s a communist… [She] works for the Chinese government,” Carvalho said, adding that “so does Joe Biden.”These statements are false. In an October 2020 Epoch Times op-ed, Loudon laid out evidence for his claim that Harris has communist ties. He pointed to her “leftist parents” (who in the 1960s were “active in the Berkeley-based Afro-American Association”), to her relationship with former Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown (whom Loudon calls a “communist sympathizer”), and to her husband. Loudon’s claim about Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is based on an article from the National Pulse, which speculated that Emhoff’s former employer, the DLA Piper law firm, employed people with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and “advised” the Chinese Embassy in Australia and China-based companies.PolitiFact has debunked the claims that Emhoff “represents” the CCP. “[N]one of this proves that the firm [DLA Piper] is subject to undue CCP influence. Rather, it reflects the way that business and government are intertwined in China,” foreign policy experts told PolitiFact.  Since 2016, the Epoch Times “has used aggressive Facebook tactics and right-wing misinformation to create an anti-China, pro-Trump media empire,” The New York Times wrote in an investigation published last October.“[T]he organization and its affiliates have grown, in part, by relying on sketchy social media tactics, pushing dangerous conspiracy theories and downplaying their connection to Falun Gong [a relatively obscure Chinese spiritual movement],” the Times found.The conspiracy theories mentioned in The New York Times article include QAnon, misleading claims about voter fraud and the Black Lives Matter movement, and, more recently, the claim that Antifa activists were behind the Capitol riot. The FBI has said there is no evidence of Antifa involvement. In a piece for VICE News, Nina Berman and Ishaan Jhavery, researchers at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and Columbia University’s Engineering and Journalism schools, wrote that giant flags with photographs promoting Epoch’s NTD TV network were seen amid the pro-Trump crowds on January 6.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Olavo de Carvalho and Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo during a meeting at the Brazil embassy in Washington, D.C., United States, on March 17, 2019. Carvalho has been living in self-imposed exile in the United States since 2005. From his home in Virginia, he’s managed to tap into the center of the conservative movement in Brazil, mainly through his YouTube channel, which has more than 1 million followers. Carvalho caught the attention of Bolsonaro in 2014, while Bolsonaro was a member of Brazil's Congress. During his live-streamed, election-night victory speech, Bolsonaro displayed one of Carvalho's books, “The Least You Need to Know Not to Be an Idiot.”In a Washington Post profile, author Terrence McCoy reported that Carvalho “is credited by supporters and critics alike for providing the intellectual spark that ignited the rapid rise of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.” In March 2019, Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the Brazilian president’s sons, said that “without Olavo, there wouldn’t have been the election of Jair Bolsonaro.” He made his comments during a screening of a film about Carvalho at the Trump International Hotel, in Washington, D.C.Carvalho continued to exert influence on the new Bolsonaro administration. He recommended Ernesto Araujo, a career diplomat who shares Carvalho’s conspiratorial theories about globalism and the “New World Order,” to the position of foreign minister. Bolsonaro followed the recommendation.Carvalho and Bolsonaro had a falling out in June 2020, after the president failed to “defend” Carvalho when he was sued for allegedly making false accusations of pedophilia against Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso.";http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq1ZBdbEM60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJHTTka0AI&t=60s,https://www.ft.com/content/20b114b5-5419-493b-9923-a918a2527931,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-s-election-fight-includes-over-30-lawsuits-it-s-n1248289,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/politics/biden-legal-challenges-trump.html,https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/politics/chris-krebs-trump-election-security-60-minutes-interview/index.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-senators-criticize-trumps-firing-of-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs/,https://www.ft.com/content/20b114b5-5419-493b-9923-a918a2527931,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html,https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/articles-impeachment-trump-xml/b0422e292cebafda/full.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-in-brazil-disputed-claims-spread-about-us-election-fraud/30977063.html,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/trump-campaign-attacks-biden-with-ads-on-mental-sharpness/2149840/,https://twitter.com/RepGregMurphy/status/1291025229171564544,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-stenographer-mental-acuity-public-speaking-white-house,https://go.joebiden.com/page/-/CiU2iAa4Ig_%20j5EQzueoad.pdf,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/,https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/04/03/anti-immigrant-roundup-4318,https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-is-no-one-except-the-president-calling-out-kamala-harriss-communist-ties_3538284.html,https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/harris-husband-ccp/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/02/facebook-posts/no-evidence-kamala-harris-husband-represents-chine/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/technology/epoch-times-influence-falun-gong.html,https://www.vox.com/2020/10/9/21504910/qanon-conspiracy-theory-facebook-ban-trump,https://www.ntd.com/left-wing-activist-encouraged-intruders-inside-capitol-urged-police-to-leave-post_551337.html,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/fbi-no-antifa-capitol-mob,https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdmde/what-we-saw-at-the-capitol-hill-insurrection,https://vizpolresearch.medium.com/about-3ed0d6d6d64c,https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/no-live-da-vitoria-biblioteca-do-presidente-da-biblia-churchill-23194605,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/hes-the-rush-limbaugh-of-brazil-he-has-bolsonaros-ear-and-he-lives-in-rural-virginia/2019/07/14/4f73dee2-8ac4-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html,https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eduardo-bolsonaro-diz-em-washington-que-brasileiros-ilegais-no-exterior-sao-vergonha-nossa-23529593,https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2020/06/09/olavo-cobra-ajuda-de-bolsonaro-em-processo-movido-por-caetano-entenda.htm;After Capitol Hill Fury, Bolsonaro ‘Guru’ in US Spreads Conspiracy Theories;;;;;;
239;;;;False;Hu Xijin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/zhang-zhan-coronavirus-censorship/6742740.html;Chinese Party Paper Whitewashes State Censorship over Coronavirus Reporting in Wuhan;2020-12-31;polygraph;William Echols;"On December 28, a court in Shanghai, China sentenced citizen journalist Zhang Zhan to four years in prison for her reporting on the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China.Zhan was charged under article 293 of the 1997 revision of the People's Republic of China's Penal Code — “Picking quarrels and provoking trouble.”In early February 2019, Zhang Zhan had travelled from Shanghai to Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. According to a Washington, DC based watchdog Chinese Human Rights Defenders, using Wechat, Twitter, and YouTube Zhang reported “numerous stories including the detentions of other independent reporters and harassment of families of victims.” She was arrested on May 15.Following an international condemnation of Zhang’s imprisonment, editor-in-chief of the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper Hu Xijin claimed, that Zhang had gone to Wuhan only to “make trouble.” He said she was not a citizen journalist, but a “paranoid poisoned whisperer” who used “inflammatory headlines” in order to gain attention. The “micro-views and emotional clues” present in her reporting amounted to “a major distortion of Wuhan's actual battle against the epidemic,” Hu wrote in an editorial piece published on December 29.“In fact, during Wuhan's lockdown, many journalists were there reporting the real situation. Various kinds of videos were constantly released by ordinary residents on social media platforms … Meanwhile, some of the articles and photos got the situation wrong, sparking fierce controversy. But apart from the online squabble, none led to serious consequences. Why was Zhang the only one sentenced to 4-year imprisonment for picking quarrels and provoking trouble?”The claim that no other journalist and citizen faced consequences for documenting the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is false. While the information coming out of China is limited, there are several known cases when people were arrested for their reports or social media posts. At least three have disappeared, and one person has not yet resurfaced.Among them are citizen journalists Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin, and Li Zehua, all of whom went missing after documenting the situation on the ground in Wuhan. Their reporting included footage of packed hospitals and workers purportedly transporting the corpses of COVID-19 victims.Chen Qiushi, a former human rights lawyer and video journalist, disappeared for seven months after going to Wuhan in late January to document the realities of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan. In a final video message posted in February, Chen stated that he was not afraid of the Community Party of China and would continue to report on what he saw in the city.According to associates, Chen resurfaced at his parents’ house in September. Despite not being charged, Chen reportedly remains under the strict supervision of authorities.Li Zehua, formally an employee of state-run CCTV, traveled to Wuhan to find Chen Qiushi and to document the outbreak. He filmed part of a car chase with authorities and his subsequent detention by police in February. Li reappeared nearly two months later explaining his absence as an extended quarantine.Li praised the police for caring about him “very much.”Meanwhile, Fang Bin, a Chinese businessman and citizen journalist, has not been heard from since being arrested on February 9. Fang also published videos purportedly showing patients suffering from COVID-19 in a hospital and a van, loaded with the bodies of coronavirus victims.Prior to his disappearance, Fang recorded encounters with police at his home, as well as a tearful video discussing the disappearance of Chen and the death of Li Wenliang, a Chinese whistleblower who warned fellow doctors in early December 2019 about a SARS-like virus in Wuhan.After he sounded the alarm, Li was interrogated by security officials, who made him sign a confession for ""publishing untrue statements about seven confirmed SARS cases at the Huanan Seafood Market.” Li died in February after treating a patient infected with COVID-19 at Wuhan Central Hospital.Li’s death sparked grief and outrage across the country over the state of censorship in China.This combination of pictures created on February 7, 2020 shows Chinese coronavirus whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, whose death was confirmed on February 7 at the Wuhan Central Hospital, China.Fang’s last video before his disappearance showed a written message that he read aloud: “Resist all citizens, hand the power of the government back to the people.”In January, the authorities in Wuhan detained eight people for publishing “rumors” and “forwarding fake news without verification, which has had an adverse social impact.”At the time, Global Times’ Hu wrote on China’s social media platform Weibo that the “misinformers” had been invited to answer a few questions and participate in the investigation. He claimed the interrogation was above board and none of the individuals were kept in custody or punished. That post is now unavailable.In his recent Global Times editorial Hu denied that Zhang’s case was an example of the state censorship. Instead, the West is “ruthlessly exploiting” it “to split Chinese public opinion” and “jeopardize Chinese unity,” he said.Following Zhang’s sentencing, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the “sham prosecution and conviction” and demanded her release.The European Union also called for her “immediate release.”Citing credible sources, the EU said Zhang “has been subject to torture and ill-treatment during her detention” and should receive “adequate medical assistance.”Zhang’s lawyer, Zhang Keke, told the Voice of America that Zhang had been on a hunger strike for nearly five months after her arrest in May.Lawyers Zhang Keke (R) and Ren Quanniu, representing Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, in Shanghai, China on December 27, 2020.Zhang Keke said that while Zhang had been accused of publishing “problematic remarks” on China’s social media platforms including Weibo and WeChat, none of those videos were presented as evidence at trial.“She didn’t fabricate any reports, nor has she created any harm to the society,” Zhang Keke said.Chinese Human Rights Defenders’ profile of Zhang Zhan describes her as a former lawyer, “who has been repeatedly harassed and threatened by the authorities” for criticizing politics and human rights situation in China.In 2019, she was arrested for supporting the anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong in her public posts. During her detention, she was reportedly forced to undergo two psychiatric examinations.Pro-democracy activist Alexandra Wong attents a protest for the release of 12 Hong Kong activists and Zhang Zhan in Hong Kong on December 28, 2020.Zhang’s conviction corresponds with the publication of study, conducted by a Chinese Centre for Disease Control, suggesting the number of people infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan may be ten times higher than the official count.Beijing has long maintained it never withheld information relating to the initial outbreak of COVID-19.But leaked documents obtained by CNN show authorities were painting a rosier picture of the situation and hiding the real scope of the infection in Wuhan from the public.";https://www.nchrd.org/2020/09/zhang-zhan/,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3102757/missing-chinese-citizen-journalist-chen-qiushi-parents-under,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277439,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52392762,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/02/07/coronavirus-doctor-li-wenliang-death-china-censors-anger-speech/4688827002/,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/rumors-01212020145514.html,https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/the-2019-coronavirus-virus-lands-in-the-u-s-after-killing-17-and-taking-eight-to-prison/,https://www.state.gov/on-the-silencing-and-prosecution-of-prc-citizen-journalist-zhang-zhan/,https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/91048/china-statement-spokesperson-sentencing-journalists-lawyers-and-human-rights-defenders_en,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/four-year-jail-term-citizen-journalists-covid-reporting-china,https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20201230-wuhan-covid-19-cases-may-have-been-ten-times-higher-than-first-reported-study-finds,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/30/asia/wuhan-china-covid-intl/index.html;Chinese Party Paper Whitewashes State Censorship over Coronavirus Reporting in Wuhan;;;;;;

Russia denied it.“Apart from five employees of [the Russian Defense Ministry’s] representative office at the CAR Defense Ministry in Bangui, there aren’t any other Russian military personnel here,” Russia’s Ambassador to CAR Vladimir Titorenko said on December 21. A member of the close protection unit for Central African Republic (CAR) President Touadera, composed by Russian private security company operatives from Sewa Security, are seen in Berengo, CAR on August 4, 2018.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov also denied the deployment on the same day.""We are not sending troops, we are complying with all UN resolutions,"" he said.The claims that Russia only had five defense ministry employees in CAR, and that Moscow did not send in additional troops, are false.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed the deployment to CAR on December 22.""For the purpose of providing assistance to [the capital] Bangui in strengthening the defenses of the Central African Republic Russia promptly responded to the request of its leadership to dispatch a group of 300 instructors to train personnel for the national armed forces,"" the ministry said in a statement.The foreign ministry did not provide any explanation as to what caused its initial denials.Russia says its military instructors are in CAR under a 2018 defense cooperation agreement with the country’s government. And that Russia has boosted military presence there to support its government against paramilitary groups who are “seeking to destabilize the internal situation and frustrate” the December 27 presidential election in CAR.However, Russia’s involvement in the landlocked African state has been murky.New recruits for the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) march in formation during an award presentation in Berengo, CAR on August 4, 2018.In March 2018, Russia’s foreign ministry announced it was exploring “the mutually beneficial development” of the country’s natural resources.Three months later, in July 2018, three Russian journalists were killed in CAR while investigating what a Russian private military company Wagner Group with ties to the Kremlin was doing there. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reportedly the owner of PMC Wagner.On September 23, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on ""entities and individuals working on behalf of Prigozhin to advance Russia’s interest” in CAR.The Treasury said Prigozhin owns or controls two companies that conduct mining operations in CAR. The first is Russia-based M Finans that is primarily involved in the mining of precious metals and private security. The other firm, CAR-based Lobaye Invest, is mainly involved in the extraction of gold and diamonds.The Treasury noted that “[b]oth M Finans and Lobaye Invest have been linked to PMC Wagner’s operations in CAR.”According to Bloomberg, Prigozhin’s expansion in CAR coincided with a spike in Russian diplomatic activity. The publication said it was difficult to separate Prigozhin’s interests from that of the Russian state.Africa Report said Wagner had supplied more than 1,000 personnel to CAR in 2019 for training and security purposes.The situation in CAR escalated after the anti-government rebels seized Bambari, the country’s fourth largest city, on December 22. United Nations peacekeepers and national security forces retook the city the following day. Last week, the officials in CAR accused the country’s ex-president Francois Bozizé of attempting to seize power in a military coup with the help of the rebels.Bozizé, who originally seized power in a 2003 military coup, was elected president in 2005 and re-elected in 2011. A Muslim rebel coalition known as Séléka outed him from power in 2013. Last January, Bozizé said nothing would stop him from running in the election against incumbent President Faustin-Archange Touadera.Earlier in December, the country’s Constitutional Court banned the ex-president from running in the election citing the sanctions the UN imposed against Bozizé in 2014.The UN also issued an international warrant for Bozizé’s arrest for crimes against humanity and established a special mission in CAR to protect civilians and help bring stability to the country.In 2019, the government and 14 rebel groups signed a peace deal, but violence and instability continued to rack the country. Government control is largely limited to the capital.Seeking help to bolster CAR’s armed forces and establish central authority, Touadera in recent years has turned to Moscow.On December 27, voters reportedly turned out in large numbers to vote in the CAR presidential and legislative elections despite threats from rebel groups to descend on the capital.Provisional results are expected by the end of the week. The election will go to a second round if none of the 16 presidential candidates captures at least 50% of the vote.On December 25, unidentified combatants killed three and wounded two UN peacekeepers tasked with helping provide security during the elections.";https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-election-security/russia-rwanda-send-military-support-to-central-africa-republic-to-quell-election-violence-idUSKBN28V1IF,https://ria.ru/20201221/voennye-1590301588.html,https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2020/12/21/n_15393524.shtml,https://tass.com/politics/1238587,https://www.gazeta.ru/army/2018/03/22/11692615.shtml,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-signs-military-cooperation-deal-central-african-republic-vagner-investigation-russian-reporters-killed/29446656.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-news-accidentally-reveals-evidence-of-pmc-wagner-in-car/30197589.html,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1133,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-20/putin-chef-yevgeny-prigozhin-is-now-meddling-in-africa,https://www.theafricareport.com/16511/russias-murky-business-dealings-in-the-central-african-republic/,https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20201223-un-retakes-rebel-held-town-in-run-up-to-election-in-central-african-republic,https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20201222-rebels-seize-central-african-republic-s-fourth-largest-city-five-days-before-nationwide-elections,https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/03/c-a-r-s-ex-president-francois-bozize-barred-from-dec-polls//,https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/2127/materials/summaries/individual/fran%C3%A7ois-yangouvonda-boziz%C3%A9,https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/minusca,https://www.voanews.com/africa/central-african-republic-votes-massively-amid-sporadic-rebel-gunfire,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55451763;Russia’s Disinfo Backfires, Causes Contradictory Messaging on Troop Deployment in Central African Republic;;;;;;
241;;;;Misleading;Alex Saab;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-detained-in-africa-maduro-ally-conjures-up-a-venezuela-without-corruption/6742723.html;Detained in Africa, Maduro Ally Conjures Up a Venezuela Without Corruption;2020-12-19;polygraph;Mariana Castro;"On December 14, the Columbian radio station La W published a letter from Alex Saab, a Columbian businessman who’s been described as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s main dealmaker. In it, Saab attacked the United States for the blockades and sanctions it has imposed on Venezuela over the years. But he also made misleading statements about corruption in Venezuela, including this one: ""[T]he only corruption I have seen is from the famous Americans lobbyists who go there and steal millions of dollars from the government promising to fix the situation between the countries.” Saab himself was arrested in June in Cape Verde on suspicion of money laundering and remains in custody there. He broke his silence with the letter to La W – the popular radio station that has interviewed prominent figures like former U.S. president Bill Clinton, and broadcasts to 22 Colombian cities, as well as the U.S., Spain, Panama, England and France.  Contrary to Saab’s claim, Venezuela is one of many South American countries tainted by corruption. Transparency International, the Berlin-based non-governmental organization that tracks public sector corruption, ranked Venezuela the world’s fifth most corrupt country in its 2019 Corruption Perception Index. On a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (clean), Venezuela scored 16. As the New York Times reported on November 19, people who once supported Maduro but have started to speak out against his government’s corruption and cronyism were being repressed (or killed) ahead of the parliamentary elections that took place on December 6. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, was also accused of corruption by former supporters. Wilmer Azuaje, who worked with Chavez and his family, claimed the former president’s parents and brothers controlled farms, businesses, banks and government contracts, the Guardian reported in 2010. Azuaje’s allegations were part of “wider complaints that the revolutionary socialist movement known as 'chavismo' [had] been hijacked by money-driven opportunists inside, or close to, the government,” the newspaper wrote. Journalists working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on a project known as the FinCEN Files found that “boligarchs” – as business tycoons close to the Chavez and Maduro governments are known – moved enormous amounts of public money out of the country. The cash often came from contracts for “housing and other basic services,” they reported. Saab figured in the FinCEN Files investigations, which were based on a leak of suspicious activity reports that banks made to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The Venezuelan newspaper Armando.info published reports revealing how, since 2017, Saab received millions of dollars through an offshore company based in Hong Kong that artificially inflated food prices under a government program to subsidize food for Venezuela’s poor. In January, Maduro’s lawyer hired a Washington lobbyist “as part of a $12.5 million effort to ease sanctions and reset bilateral relations as the U.S.-backed campaign to oust the socialist leader stalls” the Associated Press reported. VENEZUELA – The headquarters of PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company in Caracas, February 17, 2019. In June, Saab was arrested by police in Africa’s Cape Verde on a warrant from the United States, when his plane stopped in the island nation to refuel. The U.S. imposed sanctions on him in 2019 for allegedly “orchestrating a vast corruption network that has enabled [Maduro’s regime] to significantly profit from food imports and distribution in Venezuela” and is now trying to extradite him from Cape Verde. The FinCEN Files investigations found that Saab was involved in activities similar to those outlined by U.S. authorities. Maduro’s government says Saab “has diplomatic immunity and was on a humanitarian mission to secure food for the poor and medical equipment to combat coronavirus,” the Financial Times reported. Saab has done business with both the Chavez and Maduro governments, and has been accused of facilitating dubious government schemes, including a $4.5 billion contract with the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A, and helping the Venezuelan regime export gold of suspicious origin to Turkey and other countries. He has also been named in the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents exposing the operations of offshore banks.  Living situation in Venezuela  In his letter, Saab compared the living situation in Venezuela to that of Columbia for a person with $250, which he said is the average minimum monthly salary for Venezuelans, if government subsidies are taken into account. He claimed that “by the end of the month the Venezuelan has money and ate, and the Colombian has debts and didn’t eat.” However, a 2020 United Nations study found that one in three Venezuelans are facing hunger, and that more than a third of Venezuela’s 9.3 million people are either “moderately” or “severely"" food insecure. In 2019, nearly 65 percent of Venezuelan households lived under “multidimensional poverty” according to the National Survey of Living Conditions conducted by researchers at Andres Bello Catholic University. Venezuela produces only 30 percent of its food supply, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The country’s economic collapse, due mainly to the fall of oil prices and hyperinflation, has created a hunger and humanitarian crisis and sparked the exodus of an estimated 5 million people from the country (2 million more than the number cited by Saab in his letter.) Even when the Venezuelan government’s program of subsidies was working, it was plagued by mismanagement. In 2016, the Guardian wrote that beneficiaries of the government’s Gran Mision Vivienda program, launched by Chavez in 2011 to provide housing for poor Venezuelans, did not have running water in 2014, some three years later. By 2016, power outages had become routine.Faced with acute gasoline shortages in a country that possesses the world’s largest oil reserves, Maduro pledged in May of this year to scale back fuel subsidies and privatize service stations, the Wall Street Journal reported. With these changes, Venezuelans will have access to 32 gallons of gas per month (for almost 10 cents a gallon). If they need more, it will cost $1.90 a gallon, and will be sold at 200 gas stations around the country that have been privatized to unspecified businessmen, the Journal wrote. As Polygraph.info reported in June, Venezuela’s minimum hourly wage, 400,000 bolivares (currently worth $1.60), was not enough to buy 500 grams of butter ($2.60), 30 eggs ($3) or a kilo of powdered milk ($2.30) (based on the prices of products as of April 25 of this year).  VENEZUELA – A woman shows a flour package outside a supermarket as they shout slogans over food shortage in Caracas, Venezuela, June 11, 2016. The sanctions that the U.S. imposed on Venezuela for, among other things, alleged human rights violations and corruption, have kept crude oil buyers away, deepening the country's economic crisis. In November 2019, Maduro embraced dollarization – using U.S. dollars in addition to or instead of a country’s own currency, usually due to a devaluing of the local currency (as is the case in Venezuela) aimed at stabilizing the economy. A year later, Bloomberg reported that Venezuelan central bank officials were discussing plans for a system of dollars with local Venezuelan banks. The system would start next year.Since a disputed election in 2018, Maduro and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó have been locked in a political stalemate. The U.S. and some 65 other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s leader, while the U.N. still recognizes Maduro and has pushed for a negotiated resolution. After this year’s parliamentary elections (which took place on December 6 and were boycotted by the opposition), Maduro took back control of the National Assembly, consolidating his power in the country.On December 18, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement urging ""all countries committed to democracy to condemn the fraudulent December 6 elections and the illegitimate regime’s continuing efforts to destroy democracy in Venezuela.""";https://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/actualidad/mensaje-de-alex-saab-a-la-w-desde-su-detencion/20201214/nota/4094817.aspx,https://www.ft.com/content/c8584806-a6a4-4339-9f0c-033385e244c7,https://www.wradio.com.co/escucha/archivo_de_audio/expresidente-de-eeuu-bill-clinton-hablo-con-la-w/20131209/oir/2033378.aspx,https://www.wradio.com.co/escucha/programas/la-w/quienes_somos/iprograma/14085.aspx,https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019/results/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-critics-repression.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/18/hugo-chavez-revolution-corruption-claims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/18/hugo-chavez-revolution-corruption-claims,https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/how-banks-helped-venezuelas-boligarchs-extract-billions/,https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/09/20/nota/7984663/fincen-files-alex-saab-testaferro-nicolas-maduro-antigua-barbuda,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/ally-of-venezuelas-maduro-hires-d-c-lobbyist-to-build-ties,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm741,https://www.ft.com/content/c8584806-a6a4-4339-9f0c-033385e244c7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-pdvsa-contract-specialrepor/special-report-in-venezuelas-murky-oil-industry-the-deal-that-went-too-far-idUSKCN1061U9,https://armando.info/Reportajes/Details/2502,https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/13005986,https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1058051,https://reliefweb.int/report/venezuela-bolivarian-republic/wfp-venezuela-food-security-assessment-main-findings-data,https://es.reuters.com/article/venezuela-poverty-idLTAL1N2EE1MG,http://www.fao.org/in-action/agronoticias/detail/en/c/1071630/,https://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR_Venezuela%20Situation_25%20May%202020.pdf,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/venezuela-unrest-chavistas-maduro-protests-shortages,https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-in-historic-shift-moves-to-scale-back-fuel-subsidy-11590961477,https://www.polygraph.info/a/venezuela-maduro-covid-19/30699173.html,https://twitter.com/ReporteYa/status/1254431069245444096,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/maduro-says-thank-god-for-dollarization-in-venezuela-idUSKBN1XR0RV,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/venezuela-is-said-to-discuss-dollarization-plan-with-local-banks,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/venezuela-65-countries-support-guaido-backs-maduro-190215134801090.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuela-election-national-assembly-maduro-guaido/2020/12/06/8a9fee74-35d2-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html,https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-takes-actions-against-supporters-of-the-illegitimate-maduro-regimes-fraudulent-elections/;Detained in Africa, Maduro Ally Conjures Up a Venezuela Without Corruption;;;;;;
242;;;;Misleading;Global Times;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-india-galwan-clash/6742706.html;China’s Murky Claims About the India Border Clash;2020-12-08;polygraph;William Echols;"A December 4 article in China’s state-run Global Times accused the United States of trying to “stir up regional conflict” between China and India by weighing in on border clashes in the western Himalayas between the two nuclear-armed states earlier this year.The article was written in response to the release of the 2020 report to the U.S. Congress by the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission. Congress set up that body to inform the U.S. government about China’s activities on the global stage, including in matters of security, trade, politics and human rights.The report states that ""some evidence suggested” Beijing planned a massive June 2020 physical brawl involving Chinese and Indian troops in the Galwan River Valley, a disputed territory in eastern Kashmir.A map taken from the article, ""India-China border clash explained"", published in the South China Morning Post on July 2, 2020.Global Times cited a Tsinghua University academic who called the U.S. report “distorted,” accusing President Donald Trump’s administration of seeking to “exacerbate China's conflict with its neighbors to benefit the U.S.”The article further blamed India for what were the most violent border clashes between the two countries in decades.“The Galwan Valley clash broke out on June 15 between China and India’s border defense troops after Indian troops crossed the border and launched provocative attacks against Chinese personnel,” the Global Times claimed.“A later statement by China’s Foreign Ministry suggested that Indian border troops should bear full responsibility for the clash, as they were the first to illegally cross the Line of Actual Control (LAC). They violated the agreement and made provocations, and breached international norms to launch attacks, the statement said.”The claim that Indian troops instigated the fighting is misleading. No clear evidence of who or what sparked the incident has been made public by China, India or the United States.The fighting reportedly left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead (Indian media reported 43 Chinese fatalities). Those were the first deaths along the LAC since 1975.China has consistently maintained that India is entirely to blame for the incident.India’s External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in June that the skirmishes were a “pre-meditated and planned action” by China.While saying the Chinese were at fault, the U.S. commission report does not specifically say who initiated the bloody hand-to-hand melee. Soldiers reportedly used clubs spiked with barbwire and rods as weapons. The combat took place in freezing temperatures at an elevation of 4,300 meters.Video footage that the South China Post released, purportedly showing clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley, might actually be from an incident that happened in May, a military analyst told the paper on condition of anonymity.The U.S. claim that China orchestrated the clash relies on publicly accessible circumstantial evidence.For example, the U.S. commission said satellite images showed a large Chinese troop buildup in the Galwan Valley a week before the melee, “including potentially 1,000 PLA [People’s Liberation Army] soldiers.”The report stated that the “proximate cause of the clash appeared to be India’s construction of a strategic access road to support troops” along the disputed border in the Kashmir region.That satellite-related information came from Reuters and the Australian Policy Institute (ASPI), which analyzed pictures taken by Earth-imaging company Planet Labs.ASPI said the Chinese military did not have positions in the valley before May of this year. It added that China’s decision to move as many as 1,000 soldiers into the valley was apparently prompted by “recently established Indian positions closer to the LAC, and the construction of a road to supply these positions.”“Strategically, (Chinese) advances into the Galwan River Valley provide a superior vantage point for observing a supply route used by the Indian Army to reach its northernmost base, and the world’s most elevated airfield, Daulat Beg Oldi,” ASPI said.Beijing also has been building up infrastructure along the LAC.“China is constructing roads in the valley and possibly damming the river,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California’s Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told Reuters.Beijing is also building the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor “in the critical Gilgit-Baltistan region where China abuts Pakistan and India,” and to the west of a contentious Indian road that runs “almost parallel to the border separating Ladakh from China’s Xinjiang province,” the South China Morning Post reported.The U.S. commission further noted that during a panel discussion on the sidelines of the Chinese National People’s Congress (NPC) on May 23, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said it was necessary to use “fighting to promote stability.”However, he did not mention India.The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2020 report cited a vague threat published in the Global Times, which warned that India “would suffer a ‘devastating blow’ to its trade and economic ties with China if it got ‘involved in the U.S.-China rivalry’.”Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China on September 4, 2016.Since the incident, hostilities have risked boiling over again. In September, shots reportedly were fired for the first time in 45 years, contravening a 1996 bilateral agreement that banned the use of explosives and firearms within 2 kilometers of the LAC.Unsubstantiated media reports surfaced claiming that China deployed so-called microwave weapons to reclaim territory seized by Indian troops.The 1962 Sino-India war saw China redraw the LAC on its own terms, with Indian advances in the 1967 Nathu La and Cho La clashes further muddying the issue of sovereignty along the two countries’ Himalayan border.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman tweeted: “The Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the [LAC] in the west section of the China-India boundary.”India, for its part, says the LAC falls east of the contested portion of the valley.""The position with regard to the Galwan Valley area has been historically clear. Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to [the LAC] there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China's own position in the past,” India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The U.S. commission called Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty over the entire Galwan Valley ""a new claim and significant change to the territorial status quo.”";https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/2020_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-warns-china-of-serious-impact-on-ties-modi-talks-of-befitting-reply/story-pWgAXVlQT7yeQnepFpzj3O.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-china-battle/satellite-images-suggest-chinese-activity-at-himalayan-border-with-india-before-clash-idUSKBN23P38Y,https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/satellite-images-show-positions-surrounding-deadly-china-india-clash/,https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/world/article/3091480/China-India-border-dispute/index.html,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3086308/two-sessions-china-us-rivalry-high-risk-period-chinese-defence,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54067400,https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-india-microwave-weapon/30967109.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/china-claims-over-galwan-exaggerated-and-untenable-says-india-11592665578860.html;China’s Murky Claims About the India Border Clash;;;;;;
243;;;;Misleading;Svetlana Petrenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-extremism-investigation/6742704.html;Is Russia Investigating Navalny Under Extremism Law?;2020-12-07;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;On December 1, two Russian state-owned news outlets, Interfax and TASS, reported that the law enforcement agencies in Moscow are investigating Alexey Navalny, a Russian opposition politician and leader of an anti-corruption foundation, for purported extremism. Citing anonymous “informed sources,” the news agencies reported that law enforcement opened a probe on November 30 under the Article 280 of the Russian criminal code, a law prohibiting public calls to conduct extremist activities. The move followed an interview Navalny gave to Ekho Moskvy radio station last April 27. Other Russian media outlets also reported on the investigation, citing TASS and Interfax.The Russian Federal Investigative Committee responded the same day with a denial that such an investigation had been launched. “The information disseminated in the media, that the probe is being launched by the Main Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia in Moscow based on the statements by A. Navalny, does not correspond to reality,” said committee said in a statement posted on its website and signed by its spokesperson, Svetlana Petrenko.That statement is misleading.None of the media reports about the investigation named the Investigative Committee as the agency that had launched it. In fact, the reports did not identify any specific Russian law enforcement agency as running the alleged probe.In addition, the list of crimes the Investigative Committee is authorized to pursue does not include the call to extremist activities under Article 280, according to the committee’s website.Rather, Article 151 of the Russian Criminal Code gives the Federal Security Service (FSB) the authority to investigate crimes under Article 280. The FSB has not responded to the TASS and Interfax reports.In his April 27 interview with Ekho Moskvy radio, an independent media outlet, Navalny answered questions regarding his proposed five-step COVID-19 emergency response plan for Russia. The interviewer said: “Word is that the authorities have been considering something similar, but now, after your proposal, the authorities would never do it.” Navalny answered: “You know, if our authorities are such that, in order to not do anything that would please me, they would let 60 million people starve, such authorities should definitely be overthrown right now, probably even by violent means.”Alexey Navalny is currently in Germany recovering after being treated at a specialized toxicology center for suspected poisoning. In August, he was airlifted comatose to Germany from a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after falling seriously ill aboard a plane flying to Moscow. German experts, along with others, including from the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, concluded that while in Siberia, Navalny was poisoned with the military grade chemical agent Novichok. Moscow has denied he was poisoned in Russia.According to media reports, Western intelligence agencies suspect Russia’s FSB was involved in Navalny’s poisoning.On December 1, Navalny wrote on Instagram that the President Vladimir Putin personally ordered the new extremism probe, in order to prevent Navalny from returning to Russia. Responding to accusations that he had betrayed Russia [BY WHAT – GOING TO GERMANY, ACCUSING PUTIN, BOTH?], Navalny wrote that his only betrayal was “not dying when poisoned on the orders of the Bunker Grandpa” – meaning Putin.'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov neither confirmed nor denied the existence of an extremism probe targeting Navalny when asked about it during a December 1 press briefing. Instead, he commented on Navalny’s five-step-plan, saying that in making decisions, Putin does not take under consideration the opinions of “Navalny or any other opposition forces.” Echo Moskvy editor-in-chief Alexey Venediktov said that he watched his radio station’s interview with Navalny and “of course, there is no extremism in it,” and “that is why for over six months nobody made any claims” against Navalny. Venediktov noted that others in Russia had been prosecuted for extremism “for much less.” The latest investigation is an apparent attempt to “intimidate” Navalny and prevent him from returning to Russia, Venediktov wrote on Telegram on December 1.Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation are already the target of multiple investigations, including two criminal cases the Investigative Committee launched in 2019. In 2018, Navalny was barred from running in Russia’s presidential elections after a Moscow court convicted him of embezzlement, a charge Navalny denies. Putin won the presidency.Apart from criminal cases, numerous lawsuits against Navalny and his anti-corruption group are awaiting court hearings, including complaints by the Kremlin media-arm Russia Today, billionaire and Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, and relatives of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.Over the past decade of Putin’s rule, Navalny has been his most popular opponent and harshest critic. He has led nationwide protests against Putin and his political party, and his anti-corruption investigations have exposed top Russian officials and oligarchs close to Putin.Polygraph.info fact-checked and proved as false or misleading numerous claims that Russian government officials and state-owned media have made in denying the state’s role in Navalny’s poisoning. In some cases, the claims contradict one another.The version of Novichok used in poisoning Navalny is a Soviet-developed chemical weapon, targeting a victim’s nervous system. In 2018, the United Kingdom accused the Russian government of using Novichok to poison a former FSB spy and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury.;https://www.interfax.ru/russia/739401,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/10137207,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/01/12/2020/5fc5ff129a794700ae8525f6,https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1519196/,https://sledcomrf.ru/article/7.html,https://rf-upk.ru/chast-vtoraya/razdel-viii/glava-21/statya-151.html,https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2019069.html,https://echo.msk.ru/programs/razvorot-morning/2631218-echo/?fbclid=IwAR1Wc0FKSEm6p4N__CD0hWcugCTzjckVwW-USkaZ1mYtRT4IsT3IjLvojHM,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-poisoning-fact-checkl/30794262.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/novichok-navalny-poisoned-russia-fact-check/30817598.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-navalny-poisoning-disinfo/30802987.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/16/western-spies-privately-blame-russias-fsb-for-alexei-navalny-poisoning,https://www.instagram.com/p/CIP8uodlodR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,https://www.interfax.ru/russia/739415,https://t.me/aavst55/10228,https://www.znak.com/2020-10-19/kakie_ugolovnoe_dela_i_iski_zhdut_alekseya_navalnogo_v_rossii_spisok,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045,https://www.polygraph.info/a/classic-formula-russia-spins-multiple-navalny-poisoning-narratives/30821607.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/30949281.html;Is Russia Investigating Navalny Under Extremism Law?;;;;;;

Lai, along with Next Digital’s chief executive officer and chief operations officer, are accused of using the company’s offices for purposes not stated in the lease. But while Lai’s two colleagues were released on bail, Lai was ordered to remain in custody until April 2021, because he supposedly presents a flight risk, according to public broadcaster RTHK. Lai’s supporters and critics of the Hong Kong government say his arrest is part of an escalating campaign to silence its opponents. HONG KONG – Jimmy Lai is seen escorted by Hong Kong police at the Apple Daily office, on August 10, 2020. The November incident was Lai’s fourth arrest this year. The first was in February, for “taking part in an unauthorized antigovernment march,” as the Guardian reported. In April, he was arrested for his role in 2019 Hong Kong protests. Four months later, under Hong Kong’s new security law, Lai was accused of colluding with foreign forces, arrested and released on bail. Polygraph.info previously fact checked China’s Communist Party newspaper for falsely claiming that “[Lai] and his ilk want to be U.S. pawns in Hong Kong ... and dedicated to turning Hong Kong into a pivot. They are special allies of the U.S.” Hong Kong’s police has held Lai’s passport since the beginning of this year, meaning he is unable to leave the country, Mark Simon, a former business aide of Lai, told the Washington Post. According to Simon, “the issue was an 'ongoing commercial dispute' that has been ‘criminalized' by the authorities.” Claudia Mo, a former Hong Kong Democratic legislator, told Al Jazeera that the authorities’ actions were part of a “reign of fear” intended to undermine morale among government critics. And Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and commentator, tweeted that “charging this key political opponent with *fraud* for using office space for company secretarial services in breach of lease restrictions” was a classic case of “lawfare” – the term used to describe the selective use of legal tools to target political opponents of the Chinese government. Lai was detained the same day three pro-democracy activists, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison for participating in the 2019 protests – a turn of events The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined was “no coincidence.”  HONG KONG – Anti-government demonstrators attend a flash mob protest after violent China's National Day protests, at Central, in Hong Kong, on October 2, 2019. Massive protests broke out in Hong Kong in 2019 following the introduction of an extradition bill that would have sent Hong Kong residents to mainland China for court trials. The bill was suspended in June 2019 and withdrawn in September of that year. But since then, China stepped in “to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority,” the BBC reported. At the end of June, Hong Kong promulgated a National Security Law targeting the crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Potential penalties include life in prison. Since the new security law came into effect, the media has come under pressure. As the Los Angeles Times wrote, since Lai's arrest in August, ""reporters and editors have been hiding their notes, protecting contacts on encrypted messaging apps, and contemplating how much jail time they could get for violating Hong Kong’s new national security law."" In November, an RTHK reporter was arrested for a story on alleged police misconduct. Authorities argued that she illegally used a car registration search during her investigation, but fellow journalists said ""her arrest is a scare tactic to discourage reporting,"" according to the BBC.Lai’s newspaper, Apple Daily, which has consistently criticized Beijing, called the media crackdown “barbaric acts of red terror” and openly supported pro-democracy protests by inserting protest posters into its paper copies and highlighting the feats of protest leaders in its news reports. Lai also continued to speak out, writing in a commentary for The New York Times in May that “[t]he Communist Party was always going to try to tame Hong Kong, but its latest efforts are something else.” He added: “I have always thought I might one day be sent to jail for my publications or for my calls for democracy in Hong Kong.” On December 8, Lai was awarded a special prize during the 2020 Press Freedom Awards ceremony – for his newspaper's 2019 protest coverage and for daring to continue ""to openly criticize the Chinese​ regime."" The prize was accepted on his behalf by his son.";https://twitter.com/WilliamYang120/status/1334343673190838272,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1563348-20201203.htm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/18/hong-kong-activists-arrested-over-last-years-mass-protests,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-arrest/2020/08/09/d7312f20-daa4-11ea-b205-ff838e15a9a6_story.htm,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-53745241,http://polygraph.info/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/press-freedom-and-china-s-phony-narrative-about-the-arrest-of-jimmy-lai/30784012.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/jimmy-lai-hong-kong-jail/2020/12/03/fb3170d4-3520-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/3/hong-kong-court-denies-bail-to-jimmy-lai-over-fraud-charges],https://twitter.com/antd/status/1334291863277240321,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/world/asia/joshua-wong-agnes-chow-hong-kong.html],https://www.wsj.com/articles/jimmy-lai-chinas-lie-11606951156,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/china-unveils-details-national-security-law-hong-kong,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-08-15/hong-kong-media-freedom,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54786110,https://hk.appledaily.com/opinion/20200813/BEB23RGQJ5H6TFZOCTPIGMYV4Q/,https://hk.appledaily.com/search/democracy/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/hong-kong-china-national-security-law.html,https://rsf.org/en/news/2020-rsf-press-freedom-awards-three-winners-selected-and-special-prize-honors-jimmy-lai-founder];Hong Kong’s Exaggerations in the Latest Jimmy Lai Arrest;;;;;;
245;;;;Unsubstantiated;Jin Canrong;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-india-microwave-weapon/6742685.html;Was a Chinese Microwave Weapon Used Against Indian troops?;2020-11-25;polygraph;William Echols;In a recent article in the UK Times, a Chinese academic alleged China deployed “microwave weapons” to help reclaim territory during a border standoff in the disputed Himalayan region of Ladakh. The alleged attack occurred in late August on the southern bank of Pangong Tso Lake. The lake is divided by the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory. Part of Pangong Tso, some 12 kilometers east of the LAC, is claimed by India but administered by China. Indian paramilitary soldiers stand guard at a check post along a highway leading to Ladakh, at Gagangeer some 81 kilometers from Srinagar, India, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir.In June, clashes broke out between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh’s Galwan river valley, the first such skirmishes since China defeated India in a 1962 war. The hand-to-hand fighting, sometimes at elevations as high as more than 4,000 meters, reportedly left 20 Indian and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers dead.Following that incident, Jin Canrong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, claimed a prohibition on small arms fire and the superiority of Indian soldiers hand-to-hand combat abilities at such altitudes prompted the Chinese to deploy “microwave weapons” to reclaim two strategic hilltops. “The central military commission was quite furious, ‘How could you be so careless as to let India seize the hilltops?’, so it ordered the ground be taken back, but it also demanded that no single shot be fired,” he said. “Then they came up with the clever idea to use microwave weapons.”Jin claimed that “within 15 minutes of the weapons being deployed, those occupying the hilltops all began to vomit. They couldn’t stand up, so they fled … This was how we retook the ground.” On November 17, the Indian military released a statement calling the deployment of microwave weapons in Eastern Ladakh “baseless” and the news “fake”. Indian defense expert Lt. Gen. P. R. Shankar (Ret.) has dismissed the claim.Shankar argues that such vehicle-mounted Directed Energy Weapons, (DEWs) like Raytheon’s Active Denial System (ADS) or the Chinese-manufactured Poly WB-1 Anti-Riot System, “tend to be bulky and need large power generators.” “The WB-1, presented at the [10th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai] in November 2014, had a range of about 80 meters, though it can be expanded to 1 km. However, achieving ranges of 1 km means considerable extra power. Extra power is always at a premium in high altitudes,” Shankar said. He further argues such weapons would have to be transported on a “huge truck” or “platform.” At the 2014 air show, for example, the WB-1 Anti-Riot System was mounted on 4x4 truck chassis. Examining the recent claim, Forbes technology journalist David Hambling said the symptoms described by Jin were not consistent with ADS, which heats the water under the skin, causing an intense burning sensation, but not nausea or an inability to stand up. He noted, however, that China might have developed another weapon, like the Electromagnetic Personnel Interdiction Control (EPIC) device, which the Pentagon looked into in the early 2000s. Indian police detain Indian activists as they protest against China in New Delhi, India, on June 17, 2020.“This uses microwaves to vibrate tiny sensory hairs in the inner ear, disrupting balance and causing dizziness and disorientation.

The article highlighted Cabello’s claim that “[Venezuelans] can say today that of all the countries of the Americas, the most politically stable country on the continent is the Bolivarian Homeland, the Homeland of Chávez,” and that “they (imperialism and its lackeys) know it, hence the blockade, the sanctions, persecution and baseless accusations every day.” That claim is false. Venezuela currently has the highest inflation in the world and has faced an economic, political and humanitarian crisis for over half a decade, which was only exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Although Maduro’s government has been the target of worldwide criticism and U.S. sanctions – first imposed in 2015 and toughened under the Trump administration, intensifying the country's crisis – Venezuela’s instability is due, in great part, to its leaders’ failures.  VENEZUELA – Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez greets supporters who participated to a parade in Maracay, 100 km southeast of Caracas, Venezuela, 04 February 2001. Hugo Chavez rose to power in Venezuela in 1998, with promises of social and economic reforms. With the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, the year that Hugo Chavez was elected president, Venezuela’s state was renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (in honor of Simon Bolivar, the South American political leader who led the independence of six Latin American countries from Spanish rule). Under Chavez’s government, the unemployment rate halved, extreme poverty fell dramatically, education improved and per capita GDP more than doubled during a period of elevated global oil prices. Chavez’s promises to nationalize industries and direct an enormous amount of money to social programs were instantly met with hostility by the opposition. In addition, his presidency had its own issues. Despite unprecedented oil revenue for much of his tenure, Venezuela’s fiscal picture deteriorated over time. Under his government, inflation rose from 23.57 percent in 1999 to 26 percent in 2011, and nearly 31.6 percent in 2012. Murder rates almost doubled between 1999 and 2011. Three years into Chavez’s presidency, up to a million Venezuelans protested his appointment of political allies to top positions in PDVSA (Venezuela's state-owned oil company). The unstable climate gave space for an attempted coup, tacitly supported by the former George W. Bush administration, which briefly removed Chavez from power. The coup attempt intensified the conflict in the country for the remainder of 2002. In December of that year, the Venezuelan opposition launched a two-month PDVSA general strike, or oil lockout, in an attempt to force Chavez to resign. Toward the end of Chavez’s tenure, former supporters started to speak out about corruption and economic mismanagement under his government. As The Guardian reported in 2010, Wilmer Azuaje, who worked with the former president and his family, claimed Chavez’s parents and brothers pocketed farms, businesses, banks and government contracts. Azuaje’s allegations are part of “wider complaints that the revolutionary socialist movement known as 'chavismo' [had] been hijacked by money-driven opportunists inside, or close to, the government,” The Guardian wrote.  VENEZUELA – The headquarters of PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company in Caracas, February 17, 2019. Most of Chavez’s policies were sustained thanks to Venezuela’s oil reserves, the largest in the world. Oil exports (which account for almost all of Venezuela’s export revenues) allowed him to provide subsidized goods and services to the population. However, with the fall of oil prices, which started in late 2008, his social policies became unaffordable. And, as Vox reported, Chavez “paid no attention to diversifying the economy or investing in domestic production outside of the oil sector” – a problem for a country that relies on imports for most of its basic goods and services, like food, medicine and gas. Under Nicolas Maduro, who narrowly won the presidency after Chavez’s death in 2013, Venezuela has fallen deeper into crisis. The population is suffering shortages of basics like food, water, medication and electricity. The United Nations estimates 5 million people have fled the country in recent years.Maduro’s presidential win was quickly followed by the collapse of global oil prices in 2014, which sparked an economic free fall in the country. Maduro’s first response was to print more money, which led to hyperinflation (Venezuela currently has the highest inflation rate in the world).  Mass protests followed, but they were met with force. As Polygraph.info reported in September, a United Nations-backed fact-finding mission report alleged Maduro and other high-ranking officials have been involved in systemic human rights abuses against those who opposed his government between 2014 and 2018.Along with protestors, Maduro’s regime has persecuted opposition politicians and activists, and hundreds of people have been arrested or exiled (although Maduro said in a September 1 briefing that he was pardoning 110 of them). And, more recently, the government has targeted leftist activists. As the New York Times reported on November 19, people who once supported Maduro but have started to speak out against his government’s corruption and cronyism are being repressed (or killed) ahead of the parliamentary elections set to take place in December. These moves appear to be aimed at allowing Maduro to consolidate power for the elections. “The vote, boycotted by the opposition as a sham, could bring what used to be one of Latin America’s most established democracies to the verge of being a one-party state,” The Times wrote. Maduro’s critics, the newspaper added, say that “after having crushed the political parties opposed to his version of socialism… he has trained the state’s security apparatus on disillusioned ideological allies, repeating the path taken by leftist autocrats from the Soviet Union to Cuba.” VENEZUELA – Opposition supporters take part in a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro next to a poster of him in Caracas, Venezuela, October 26, 2016. In 2017, Venezuela’s government “ensnared dozens of senior officials, especially those linked to the all-important state oil giant, PDVSA” in what it called a ""historic fight against corruption,” as the Washington Post reported, pointing out that those moves were part of Maduro’s escalating efforts to consolidate power before the 2018 presidential election. Maduro was reelected in 2018 for a second six-year term, but analysts called it a “sham election” due to irregularities of the electoral schedule and the lowest voter turnout “since Venezuela's democracy was restored in 1958,” as The Associated Press wrote. Since then, Maduro and Juan Guaido, the opposition leader appointed by the National Assembly as acting president in January 2019, have been locked in a political stalemate over control of the country. Led by the U.S., some 65 countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s leader, while the U.N. still recognizes Maduro and has pushed for a negotiated resolution.";https://mazo4f.com/diosdado-cabello-el-pais-mas-estable-que-hay-en-el-continente-es-la-patria-bolivariana,https://www.historytoday.com/archive/simon-bolivar-and-spanish-revolutions,https://www.npr.org/2013/04/13/176783269/enshrined-and-oft-invoked-simon-bolivar-lives-on#:~:text=How%3F&text=Simon%20Bolivar%20is%20often%20called,liberated%20six%20from%20Spanish%20rule.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/oct/04/venezuela-hugo-chavez,https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/oct/04/venezuela-hugo-chavez,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1039101526679054593,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/18/hugo-chavez-revolution-corruption-claims,https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/recalling-when-hugo-chavez-was-elected-president-of-venezuela/2017/11/27/ea6f4418-b8d4-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html,https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/19/16189742/venezuela-maduro-dictator-chavez-collapse,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hugo-chavez-heir-nicolas-maduro-leads-in-polls-ahead-of-vote/2013/04/14/334cd2ba-a54b-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html?utm_term=.8534e37bc463,https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Freporting.unhcr.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FUNHCR_Venezuela%2520Situation_25%2520May%25202020.pdf&data=04%7C01%7Cftlis%40voanews.com%7C04cae626442c4c91522d08d88d860c82%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C637414954168597865%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=TROt2rJA1%2BX%2BSELzwDztsbKLkZQM3jE65mdzwKxVKj0%3D&reserved=0,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-venezuelan-foreign-minister-calls-un-report-a-plot-its-not/30850284.html,https://twitter.com/VTVcanal8/status/1300913339741110273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1300913339741110273%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygraph.info%2Fa%2Fmaduro-claims-without-evidence-that-trump-ordered-him-killed%2F30819552.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-critics-repression.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-venezuela-disintegrates-maduro-consolidates-power/2017/12/08/f9e5b366-dc27-11e7-a241-0848315642d0_story.html,https://www.ft.com/content/edd6c4a0-5906-11e8-b8b2-d6ceb45fa9d0,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/venezuela-s-sham-election/,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-05-20/the-latest-pope-francis-prays-for-venezuelans,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/venezuela-65-countries-support-guaido-backs-maduro-190215134801090.html;Cabello Falsely Calls Venezuela Most Politically Stable Country in the Americas;;;;;;
247;;;;Misleading;RT;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/obama-russia-super-power/6742677.html;Obama Book Reflects on Russia’s World Status – and RT Distorts What It Says;2020-11-19;polygraph;William Echols;On November 17, the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama, released his memoir, “A Promised Land.”Obama has promoted the book as “an honest accounting of my presidential campaign and my time in office,” covering a wide range of issues, from the global financial crisis that confronted him in 2008 to his controversial escalation of the U.S. drone program.A member of a security detail keeps watch as President Barack Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in the German Chancellery in Berlin, Germany on November 17, 2016.Regarding foreign affairs, Obama took aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said Putin had become “sharply critical of American policy,” and that “when U.S.-backed initiatives came before the U.N. Security Council, [Putin] made sure Russia blocked them or watered them down — particularly anything touching on human rights.”Obama’s book is unsparing toward Putin, calling him a “physically unremarkable man” who, “with the fastidiousness of a teenager on Instagram … [projected] an almost satirical image of masculine vigor.”He further likened Putin to a Chicago-style ward boss, “except with nukes and a U.N. Security Council veto,” who treated life as “a zero-sum game” where “a lack of scruples” and “a contempt for any high-minded aspirations beyond accumulating power, were not flaws” but “an advantage.”Russian-state broadcaster RT focused on the former U.S. president’s characterization of Russia’s international status in a news article headlined: “Russia isn’t a ‘superpower’ because it doesn’t project ‘military power across the globe' says former US president Obama.”Summarizing Obama, the article’s anonymous author writes:“If [Russia] wants to be taken seriously on the world stage, Russia should take a leaf out of Washington’s book and deploy more of its soldiers in other countries. That’s according to former US President Barack Obama.”This, however, mischaracterizes what Obama wrote.Nowhere does the former U.S. president state that Russia should deploy more troops in other countries to be taken seriously, nor did he say Russia is not a superpower because it “doesn’t project military power” across the globe.Rather, Obama argues that Russia is not a superpower because it lacks the capability to broadly project power like the U.S.“Despite having a nuclear arsenal second only to our own, Russia lacked the vast network of alliances and bases that allowed the United States to project its military power across the globe,” Obama wrote.GERMANY -- Two activists dressed up as U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin ride two atomic bomb models during a protest for a world without nuclear weapons in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, July 30, 2020It is open to debate whether or not Obama is right on that count. But it’s a far different point than the misrepresentation published by RT.Russia, in fact, has projected its military power beyond its borders, invading Georgia and Ukraine, as well as intervening militarily in Syria in 2015 and deploying troops to Venezuela in 2019.And, as has been the case with its 2014 annexation of Crimea and continued military involvement in eastern Ukraine, Russia has actually sought to obscure its role in various conflicts by deploying state-backed mercenaries or unmarked soldiers.The U.S. Africa Command has accused the Kremlin-backed Wagner paramilitary group of interfering in Libya. Moscow has denied that, although independent United Nations monitors have confirmed the presence of Wagner fighters in the North African country.The U.S. State Department believes as many as 2,500 Wagner troops were active in Libya during the first quarter of 2020.Wagner mercenaries have also been reported in the Central African Republic, Sudan, Mozambique and Madagascar.In August, Germany’s Bild newspaper, citing the country’s Foreign Ministry, reported that Russia seeks to build military bases in six African countries.On November 11, Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved a draft agreement on establishing a naval logistics base in Sudan to “meet the goals of maintaining peace and stability in the region.”In July, 33 members of Wagner were detained in Belarus, with Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko claiming they were there to interfere with the August 9 election. On August 14, all but one of the mercenaries — a Belarusian national — were sent back to Russia.Russia has also deployed “peacekeepers” in several neighboring states that have frozen and hot conflicts that erupted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, including Moldova, Azerbaijan and Georgia.A map from RFE/RL showing Russian military bases in Post-soviet countries.

""Since we've reinvested in border security under this administration, the results speak for themselves: Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed,” he wrote. The thread included a couple statistics about declining border crossings between the 2019 and 2020 federal fiscal years (FY), which end in September. “Illegal entries in areas of Yuma [Arizona] sector with new border wall system plummeted over 87% in FY 20 compared to FY 19,” Jennings wrote. He also cited a 79 percent decline in the Rio Grande sector. While border apprehensions are down, attributing the drop to the wall is misleading. The declines reflect a broad trend driven in part by the coronavirus pandemic and the effects of other Trump administration policies to discourage asylum seekers and make it easier to deport them. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Office of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did not respond to Polygraph.info’s requests for comment on this fact-check.  MEXICO – Commuters are seen walking to the United States wearing face masks as a preventive measure to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in Tijuana, Mexico, on the US-Mexico border. Taken on April 23, 2020. Pandemic pressures Amid the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump declared that “border security is also health security,” and his administration over the past year has rushed to meet his goal of constructing 450 new miles of border wall in his term of office. According to news reports, construction crews had been adding close to two miles per day – and bringing dozens of lawsuits against landowners in places like south Texas and cutting through national forests, wildlife preserves and other public lands under federal control. Between Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 and April 22, 2020, 170 miles of border wall were built by the administration. In the seven months that followed, 230 extra miles were built. The DHS, which includes the Customs and Border Protection office, celebrated the 400th mile of border wall on October 29. Authorities at CBP track the number of apprehensions of migrants who ask for asylum or try to avoid detection at the border or if encountered after crossing. Overall, the total count of southwest border encounters dropped 53 percent in recently ended fiscal 2020 to 400,651. According to the CBP data, the biggest decline in encounters/apprehensions happened this past March and April, when the U.S. entered a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic, allowing the president to take stricter border enforcement measures. By September, total monthly encounters had once again ticked up to their highest number this year. “Of course, when you compare numbers from 2019 and 2020, you have to take into account the pandemic, where we saw greatly reduced numbers of people trying to cross. Particularly in the beginning, particularly with families,” Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told Polygraph.info. The Yuma sector followed a similar pattern. CBP data show border apprehensions fell in April then rose in May through September. Apprehensions of ""unaccompanied alien children” in the Yuma area decreased 91 percent in fiscal 2020 from the prior year. “Family units” encounters decreased 94 percent and encounters of single adults were down 43 percent, CBP data show. Although those are big drops, they are roughly in line with some of CBP’s other sectors. For example, family encounters dropped 94 percent in the Rio Grande sector, 87 percent in Big Bend and El Centro, and 92 percent in El Paso, the data show. In all those areas, the border wall remains a work in progress. El Paso, CBP data shows, has approximately 24 miles of “new border wall system” completed, 41 miles under pre-construction and 92 miles under construction. Rio Grande Valley has three miles of completed wall, 93 miles under construction and 14 miles under pre-construction. El Centro has 17 miles of completed wall, 14 miles under construction and 13 miles under pre-construction (12 of which are secondary walls). At the same time, encounters/apprehensions also went up in some of the sectors where the wall is supposed to be a deterrent. In El Paso, for example, single adult encounters went up by 18 percent in the fiscal year. The Laredo sector, with 121 miles of border in pre-construction, saw a 35 percent increase in single adult encounters, a 62 percent rise in family unit encounters and a 5 percent increase in unaccompanied children.  MEXICO – Cuban migrants coming from the United States queue to renew the permit to remain in Mexico while U.S. authorities handle entrance requests under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Taken on July 08, 2020. ‘Remain in Mexico’  Rules established in March allowed the CBP to keep out anyone potentially presenting a COVID-19 risk at the border. But even before the pandemic, more restrictive Trump administration policies were put in place that help explain the decline in encounters. In the summer of 2019, Mexico agreed under the administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy (also known as Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP) to take back migrants picked up at all border locations rather than just a few, Bolter said. Under the policy, asylum seekers at ports of entry would wait for their U.S. immigration proceedings in Mexico instead of the United States. Mexico also stepped up its own immigration enforcement, making it harder for immigrants to cross through and reach the U.S. During the 2020 presidential race, then-candidate Joe Biden promised to end the MPP policy. Since his projected victory over Trump in the November 3 election, immigrants stuck on the Mexican side of the border have expressed hope that Biden will follow through, BuzzFeed News reported. The Biden transition team did not respond to Polygraph.info’s request for comment.In 2019, the U.S. also signed Asylum Cooperative Agreements (“ACAs”) with the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These agreements allowed the U.S. to deport asylum seekers to one of the three countries so long as they have “access to a full and fair procedure for the determination of their [asylum] claim” and aren’t at risk of their lives. (Critics say the agreements are illegal and fail to provide a safe haven for asylum seekers.) Based on the numbers, all these policies likely have had a deterrent effect. Total single adults apprehended at the Mexican border ticked up only 5 percent in 2020 to 317,864. Family encounters plunged a whopping 89 percent overall to only 52,230 from nearly half a million the prior year. Bolter attributes the latter drop mainly to the coronavirus and fear of contracting the virus while traveling. “Families are much less likely to subject their children to that,” she said.  MEXICO – An excavator removes a border fence, which will be replace by a new section of the border wall in El Paso, Texas, U.S., as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Taken on August 27, 2020. The Wall  Trump’s signature campaign promise in 2016 was to “build a wall” along the 2,000 miles of the southwest border. Before he took office, 654 miles already had barriers – 354 miles to stop pedestrians and 300 miles of vehicle fencing. As Polygraph.info reported in July, most of the border-wall construction under the Trump administration has replaced already existing barriers. On October 31, the BBC reported that 669 miles of the southern border had “primary barrier” and 65 miles of “secondary barrier” – built behind a primary structure. Only 15 miles of new, primary barriers had been built, the BBC said, citing a Trump administration report. The BBC said 350 miles of replacement or secondary structures were finished, while 378 miles of new and replacement barriers are “either under construction or in the 'pre-construction phase’."" Less than half of this will be in locations where no barriers exist now, according to CBP. Advocates for the wall and administration officials, such as the CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, argue that the old barriers weren’t proper walls and needed to be strengthened.";https://twitter.com/spoxdhs/status/1322031666739748864?s=21,https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-border-wall-push/2020/09/29/689bc740-f8f5-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html,https://archive.is/8jrzu,https://abc13.com/politics/feds-celebrate-400-miles-of-border-wall-construction/7449753/,https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration,https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration,https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration/usbp-sw-border-apprehensions,https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics/title-8-and-title-42-statistics,https://apnews.com/article/4b37a351ad294a52b3834ba0c4a23e27,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrants-mexico-us-reaction-biden-win],https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_1003_opa_fact-sheet-agreements-northern-central-america-countries.pdf],https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19-1115-Migration-and-Refugees-Guatemala-ACA.pdf,https://supportkind.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ACAs-and-N.-Triangle-Factsheet-FINAL.pdf,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-border-wall-mile-by-mile-11550152535,https://www.polygraph.info/a/trumps-border-wall-claims-fall-short/30733505.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46824649,https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-wall-system,https://twitter.com/CBPMarkMorgan/status/1321523397025763328;Twitter, Trump’s Wall and the Drop in Border Crossings;;;;;;

Currently, Russian ex-presidents cannot be detained, arrested interrogated or otherwise charged for any crimes that allegedly occurred during their tenure.The proposed changes to the law are intended to expand that immunity to cover a president’s entire lifetime.Only acts of high treason or other series felonies could result in a revocation of that immunity.Russian President Vladimir Putin attends the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council meeting via video conference in the Bocharov Ruchei residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, November 10, 2020.Russia’s TASS news service outlined the procedures for any such revocation.“Under the newly proposed bill, in order to deprive an ex-president of immunity, the State Duma would have to put forward accusations of high treason or gravely serious felonies. However, they would have to be confirmed by the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. Based on these accusations, the Federation Council [the upper chamber of Russian parliament] would have to make a decision on revoking an ex-president’s immunity,” TASS reports.“The State Duma’s decision on handing down charges and the Federation Council’s decision on rescinding immunity would have to be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all Russian senators and lawmakers at the initiative of at least one-third of the MPs of the lower house and if there is a conclusion of a special commission set up by the State Duma. After the lower house puts forward the accusations, the upper house would have three months to make a decision on stripping a former president of immunity. If this is not done, the accusations would be dismissed.”As reported by the Moscow Times, the bill followed another piece of legislation submitted by Putin that will give former presidents a lifetime seat in the country’s senate or Federation Council.Both bills are part of recently passed constitutional reforms which will pave the way for Putin to remain president until 2036, after his current term ends in 2024.On November 5, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the plan was “justified” by international norms.""Within the framework of this package, there is also [a draft law on guarantees to ex-presidents], which is a practice that is in place in many countries throughout the world, and it is rather justified,"" Peskov said.He said this was not a new international practice, adding it “fine tune[s]” the current status of presidential immunity.The legislation has sparked media reports that President Vladimir Putin, who was first inaugurated in 2000, is paving the way to step down as president in January due to rumored health complications. Peskov has dismissed those rumors as “utter nonsense.”In any case, Peskov’s claim that the proposed immunity changes are the norm worldwide is false.In the United States, for example, the Constitution does not explicitly say whether a setting president can be charged with a crime while in office, although decades-long Justice Department policy argues such a move would be “unconstitutional.”Instead, the U.S. Constitution provides a way to address misconduct with a political process: impeachment. Article II, Section 4 states that the “President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on December 18, 2019.He was acquitted on February 5, 2020, by a party line vote of the Republican-led Senate. There are no protections once a U.S. president leaves office.What about other countries?In the British Commonwealth, states including the U.K., Australia and Canada, have protections for leaders who allegedly commit while they are in office, although parliament can strip those protections if deemed necessary. As in the U.S., that immunity does not extend to a leader’s lifetime, and those rules concern prime ministers, not presidents.Throughout Europe, protections exist for sitting presidents and prime ministers, although lifetime protections are anything but the norm.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for example, was charged on October 26 for “membership in a criminal conspiracy” for allegedly accepting money from Libya to fund his 2007 presidential run.As noted by the Washington Post, several European states “treat their prime ministers, presidents or chancellors like normal members of parliament,” making it far easier to strip their immunity than the multistep U.S. impeachment process.What about outside of the West?According to a 2017 Library of Congress study, 32 countries provide for constitutional or statutory provisions concerning immunity for current and former presidents.However, only three states — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan — grant presidents “absolute immunity for any acts committed during office, including after leaving office.”In Equatorial Guinea, former presidents are deemed “for life” senators, “with all the rights, prerogatives and immunities, provided that they keep their dignity and social and political reputation.”In Rawanda, a former president is immune unless a case was initiated against them while still in office.Belarus considered granting immunity to former president in 2019, but did not follow through.Few states, however, appear to provide the sweeping protections being proposed for the Russian president.William Pomeranz, the Deputy Director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, told Polygraph.info the only reason these changes are being implemenimplemented Putin is looking to secure his post-presidential life.“Obviously, it depends on how he leaves office, and if his 2020 constitution remains in place after his departure. But the amendments and subsequent legislation suggests that he wants all the legal protection that he can get,” he said.Within Russia, reaction to the proposal has been mixed.The Riga-based online newspaper Meduza published an “incomplete list of crimes for which former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev “and someday Putin” will not be able to be tried.Russian political scientist Kiril Rogov argues the bill is intended to help Putin avoid the fate of former Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev, who was stripped of his ex-presidential immunity and charged with a litany of offenses in 2019.Atambayev was sentenced to 11 years in prison in June, freed by protesters during recent post-election unrest, and rearrested last month.“Putin's bill is obviously aimed at preventing such a situation: reprisals against a ‘former’ [president] with the help of fictitious criminal cases,” Rogov wrote.";https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/1049598-7,http://docs.cntd.ru/document/901780936,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/11/05/russia-moves-to-grant-ex-presidents-lifetime-immunity-from-prosecution-a71959,https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4564032,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-u-s-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/politics/trump-acquitted-impeachment.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54571540,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/08/22/how-other-western-democracies-prosecute-leaders-accused-crimes/,https://lenta.ru/news/2019/11/27/byvshiy/,https://meduza.io/feature/2020/11/06/byvshie-prezidenty-rossii-skoro-smogut-svobodno-narushat-ugolovnyy-kodeks-vot-nepolnyy-spisok-prestupleniy-za-kotorye-nelzya-budet-sudit-medvedeva-a-kogda-nibud-i-putina,https://www.newsru.com/blog/09nov2020/putin.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-atambayev/kyrgyz-ex-president-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison-idUSKBN23U1CS,https://www.khaama.com/kyrgyzstan-re-arrests-former-president-almazbek-atambayev-appoints-new-pm-989856/;Kremlin Justifies Lifetime Criminal Immunity for Putin with Erroneous Claim;;;;;;
250;;;;Misleading;Majid Takht Ravanchi;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-cheeck-iran-us-sanctions/6742659.html;Iran’s U.N. Envoy Distorts World Court’s Order;2020-11-06;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Speaking in New York on November 4, Iran’s envoy to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi accused the U.S. of violating the orders from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – also known as the World Court – by imposing new sanctions against his country. “Recently, in flagrant violation of the Court’s Order, the U.S. has intensified its pressures on the Iranian people in the midst of the pandemic outbreak, therefore exacerbating the situation with the intention to deprive Iran of accessing medicines, equipment and resources, which are much needed to effectively combat the deadly virus,” Takht Ravanchi said.The statement is misleading.Headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, the World Court is the United Nations’ highest judicial body. NETHERLANDS -- The delegations of the U.S., front left, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, front right, rise as judges, rear, enter the International Court of Justice, or World Court, in The Hague, October 3, 2018.Iran appealed to the court in July 2018, asking it to order the U.S. to waive sanctions that President Donald Trump’s administration imposed that May after the U.S. pulled out from the 2015 treaty in which Iran had agreed to restrict its nuclear program.Tehran claimed the U.S. sanctions violated Iran’s rights under a trade deal the U.S. signed with Iran in 1955 – the Treaty of Amity.On October 3, 2018, the ICJ ruled that “some” of Iran’s assertions were “plausible” and that “restrictions on the importation and purchase of goods required for humanitarian needs, such as foodstuffs and medicines, including life-saving medicines, treatment for chronic disease or preventive care, and medical equipment, may have a serious detrimental impact on the health and lives of individuals on the territory of Iran.” The ICJ said the U.S. “must remove, by means of its choosing, any impediments arising from the measures announced on 8 May 2018 to the free exportation to the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran of (i) medicines and medical devices; (ii) foodstuffs and agricultural commodities.”But the ICJ did not order the U.S. to remove all sanctions, as Iran had requested. Instead, the court called on both countries not to take any further steps that would escalate the situation.The U.S. maintains that trade goods the court ordered excluded were originally listed as exempt. As described in the 2013 U.S. Treasury Department’s guidance, “the U.S. maintains broad authorizations and exceptions that allow for the sale of food, medicine, and medical devices by U.S. persons or from the United States to Iran. U.S. sanctions laws provide similar allowances for sales of food, agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to Iran by non-U.S. persons … this Guidance underscores that these sales to Iran do not trigger sanctions under U.S. law.”An Iranian woman shops at a drugstore at the Nikan hospital in Tehran on September 11, 2018. - Judges at the International Court of Justice in The Hague unanimously ruled Washington should remove barriers to ""the free exportation to Iran of medicines.""Takht Ravanchi’s statement came roughly a month after the U.S., on October 8, announced another round of sanctions, blacklisting 18 major banks in Iran. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the move would still allow for transactions involving humanitarian aid.Nonetheless, experts interviewed by Reuters, Al Jazeera, the BBC and others, said that the latest sanctions “had effectively shut Iran out of the global financial system,” because they would allow the U.S. to also punish those who do business with those banks.Reuters reported that “[t]he sanctions Trump has reinstated target everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities. While they exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, many foreign banks are already deterred from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including for humanitarian deals.”In Iran, the financial sanctions are seen as particularly harsh given the hit Iran has taken from the coronavirus. Iranian officials even called the U.S. measures “genocidal.”IRAN -- A general view of empty prepared graves at the Behesht Zahra Tehran’s main cemetery in southern of Tehran, October 21, 2020.Iran’s health ministry reported on November 5 that the death toll of COVID-19 in the country is nearing 40,000 with more than 650,000 cases of infection recorded.On October 26, Iran's U.N. representative Mohammad Zareian told the General Assembly in New York that ""[t]he broad limitations imposed on Iran as a result of cruel and illegal U.S. sanctions, prevent my country from purchasing medicines, medical equipment and other necessary supplies to face the pandemic.""Human Rights Watch said restrictions on financial operations make it difficult for Iran to import drugs: “The consequences of redoubled US sanctions, whether intentional or not, pose a serious threat to Iranians’ right to health and access to essential medicines.”However, according to the Iranian Food and Drug Administration, Iran’s pharmaceutical companies are producing about 97 percent of the domestic market’s needed medicines and even exporting drugs to 30 countries.As recently as March 2019, Iran reported $26 million worth of exports of medical equipment and drugs to Iraq.Additionally, there have been persistent reports over many years that billions of dollars’ worth of medicine has been trafficked from Iran to Iraq. The latest report came on October 15, when Iranian military intelligence announced it had seized the “largest” cargo of drugs being smuggled from Iran to Iraq.The “19 trucks loaded with thousands of pieces of medicine” had been intercepted on a route taken to avoid customs, the report said. Iranian officials denied any ties to the cargo, saying that the consignments of medicine “were originally from other countries” and that attributing them to the Iranian government was “an international plot” by hostile countries.";https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Treaty-of-Amity-Economic-Relations-and-Consular-Rights-between-the-United-States-of-America-and-Iran-Aug.-15-1955.pdf,https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/175,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/iran_guidance_med.pdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/iran-sanctions-banks-united-states.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/10/9/fears-rise-over-human-toll-after,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54476894,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-sanctions/u-s-imposes-new-iran-sanctions-that-may-spook-european-banks-idUSKBN26T35H,https://en.irna.ir/news/84088475/Iran-will-never-forget-US-acting-as-accomplice-with-COVID-19,https://en.irna.ir/news/84099919/Official-COVID-19-kills-406-more-in-Iran,https://en.irna.ir/news/84089175/Report-on-human-rights-situation-in-Iran-part-of-US-maximum-pressure,https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/10/29/maximum-pressure/us-economic-sanctions-harm-iranians-right-health,https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/437152/Iran-exports-medicine-to-30-countries,https://iranintl.com/en/iran/export-26-million-medicine-and-medical-equipment-iraq,https://irannewswire.org/trafficking-behind-irans-insulin-shortage/,https://www.rferl.org/a/there-is-no-insulin-desperate-iranians-tweet-calls-for-life-saving-drug/30905516.html,https://smarthealthcarenews.com/who-dominates-irans-organized-smuggling-and-trafficking-of-goods/,https://www.alsharqiya.com/en/news/military-intelligence-thwarting-the-largest-smuggling-of-drugs-from-iran-to-iraq-through-diyala-province,https://en.irna.ir/news/84090877/Iran-denies-alleged-export-of-medicine-to-Iraq;Iran’s U.N.

251;;;;Unsubstantiated;Yu Qun;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/thai-protests-color-revolution-/6742657.html;Without Evidence, China Claims ‘Western Hands’ Behind Thai Protests;2020-11-05;polygraph;William Echols;On October 21, an editorial in the Chinese Communist Party paper Global Times claimed the West was behind ongoing student-led protests in Thailand.Yu Qun, who is a deputy director at China’s National University of Defense Technology, said anti-government forces are seeking to “bring in pro-West political proxies to rule the country with Western-styled democracy” via a “color revolution.”Pro-democracy protesters attend an anti-government protest, in Bangkok, Thailand October 18, 2020. REUTERS/Jorge Silva“It is unclear whether the Thai young generation, who are currently being used as cannon fodder by the US and its proxies, actually understand that a color revolution is not as beautiful nor peaceful as portrayed.”This unfounded conspiracy theory has also been advanced by some Thai royalists, who oppose protesters’ calls for reforms to the country’s monarchy. A small group of royalists staged a counter-protest on October 26 outside the U.S. embassy in Bangkok calling for it to “stop hybrid war in Thailand.”Hardline royalists have also blamed George Soros, the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and even Netflix for the protests against the government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.The U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Bangkok had earlier released a statement denying any such claims, saying “the United States government is not funding or otherwise providing support to any of the protests in Thailand.”In the editorial, Yu falsely characterizes the largely peaceful protests as “riots,” saying they “resemble the 2019 Hong Kong turmoil.” He specifically notes that Hong Kong student and politician Joshua Wong has “publicly supported Thai anti-government protests.”Wong’s support for the Thai protests, however, is unsurprising, given that online activists in Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been united around pro-democracy aspirations in the what’s called the “Milk Tea Alliance” (after a popular drink). Wasana Wongsurawat, an expert on China at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters in April that “anti-Beijing sentiment has become a part of Thais’ fight against authoritarianism.”That sentiment was mirrored by Thai protest leader Parit Chiwarak, who recently told The Atlantic magazine: “Everyone [in the alliance] is the victim of China and its authoritarianism.”Yu’s editorial argues that the protests are “mainly made up by [sic] young people,” adding that because they are “well-organized,” there is “no doubt that they are funded by some individuals or organizations behind the scenes.”Of course, there is no evidence that university students are incapable of organizing protests on their own.Yu claimed that protesters at an October 16 rally, where police deployed water cannons, “were well furnished with protective gear such as helmets, goggles and umbrellas,” adding: “[I]t is obviously difficult for common students to raise funds for such gear.”The notion that urban university students can’t afford umbrellas during the height of Thailand’s rain season is debatable. That doesn’t mean the protesters aren’t getting financial help, but Voranai Vanijaka, founder and editor-in-chief at the Thai online news portal Thisrupt, told Polygraph.info that it’s homegrown. “The funding [pro-democracy protesters] get are from donations from Thai people. That includes helmets and other gear. For example, the food [is] provided by the actress Sai Chareonpura. Barricades are makeshift. Mobile toilets and [other] gear are all [acquired] through donation money,” he said.Pro-democracy protesters make a three-finger salute as they march towards the Government House during an anti-government protest as they march in Bangkok, Thailand October 21, 2020. REUTERS/Athit PerawongmethaPolygraph.info spoke to a 32-year-old Bangkok resident and urban professional who had donated money to the protest movement and asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal. The individual had become aware of a fundraising campaign via Twitter that was organized by fans of Korean pop music (K-Pop). “I got the bank account [information] from Twitter. The group [I donated to] got 700,000 baht ($22,559 dollars). There are many K-Pop fans doing like this.”A screen shot provided by the donor was dated October 17, one day after the police crackdown at the rally. A screen grab from a Twitter page used to raise funds for Thai protesters via Korean pop music fans.Other media reports also have corroborated that K-pop fans helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Thai protesters.Yu asserts that “unidentified Westerners” have “openly instructed students to set up stages and barricades.” However, Voronai argues the “unidentified foreigners” are simply “residents living here [who] sympathize with the cause.”One such foreigner recently made headlines for critical social media posts that sparked a deportation controversy. No evidence has been presented that such foreigners have played any organizational role in the protests.Yu also posits that “a very professional camera team hiding in the crowd to capture ‘touching’ scenes,” as well as police attacks on unarmed protesters, has incited people to hate the government in a “clear recruitment campaign.”The protests have been attended by domestic and international media, and scenes of unarmed protesters being attacked by police have generated public sympathy. But there is no evidence this is a deliberate recruitment strategy.Voronai argues the decision by Chinese state media to promote a conspiracy theory fits with its regional ambitions. “[The] Chinese are betting on the present regime in their geopolitical expansion into Southeast Asia. The protesters are pro-democracy, which they see as undermining their cause. It’s better to have a [Prime Minister] Prayut & Co running things. [It’s] easier to align interests,” he told Polygraph.info.Supporters of Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha walk with a Thai national flag as they support their support for the government at a park in Bangkok, Thailand January 12, 2020.The first wave of the 2020 protest movement began after the opposition Future Forward Party was dissolved on February 21. The party, which called for democratic reforms and curbs on the military, broadly appealed to young voters. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a halt of political activity in Thailand, but in July student activists began organizing large-scale street demonstrations despite an ongoing state of emergency. The protesters have demanded Prayut Chan-o-cha's resignation, amendments to the 2017 constitution and the reform of the monarchy.The 2017 constitution was drafted under the Prayut-led military junta, which came to power following a coup in 2014. The country nominally returned to civilian rule following 2019 elections, with Prayut continuing on at the helm.The national charter has long been a sticking point for pro-democracy activists. Under it, Thailand has a 750-member bicameral parliament, with 500 elected members of the House of Representatives and 250 senators handpicked by the Royal Thai military, who also have a say in choosing the prime minister.The constitution binds elected governments to follow the 20-year economic roadmap drafted by the military junta, while also expanding the powers of the king. Since becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1932, Thailand has experienced 19 military coups and just as many constitutions.;https://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2020/08/31/u-s-embassy-denies-funding-anti-govt-protests/,https://th.usembassy.gov/statement-refuting-disinformation/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-china-internet/young-thais-join-milk-tea-alliance-in-online-backlash-that-angers-beijing-idUSKCN21X1ZT,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/milk-tea-alliance-anti-china/616658/,https://thisrupt.co/,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/03/asia-pacific/thailand-protests-kpop/,https://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/crimecourtscalamity/2020/11/02/expat-says-police-to-deport-him-over-facebook-posts/,https://prachatai.com/english/node/8709;Without Evidence, China Claims ‘Western Hands’ Behind Thai Protests;;;;;;

Published Reports Say He’s Wrong.;2020-10-25;polygraph;Mariana Castro;"On October 15, the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States (OAS) publicly denounced persistent human rights violations in Nicaragua and urged the government to release political prisoners, restore fundamental freedoms and respect the separation of powers and rule of law:“The government's has refused to comply with the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI), and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and to fulfill its duties under the Inter-American Democratic Charter.” Four days later, Nicaragua’s president, Daniel Ortega, dismissed allegations that political prisoners made of being tortured, calling them “lies” and an attempt to taint the country’s image. “There are always prisoners who make up that they're being tortured … they invent things simply to create a negative image on Nicaragua before international organizations run by the yanquis [referring to the United States], like the OAS,” Ortega said during a speech.Based on multiple published reports, Ortega’s claim that torture accusations are invented is false. NICARAGUA – A masked youngster protests against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's government in front of a line of riot police blocking a street in Managua, on September 13, 2018. Nicaragua under Ortega has faced extensive international scrutiny for violations of human rights. These include ""targeting civil society, human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, community and religious leaders, journalists and other media workers, students, victims and their family members, and individuals expressing critical views of the Government,” according to the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC).In April 2018, protests broke out in Nicaragua as fiscal reforms slashed social security. Protestors were met with a violent and lethal response from the government, fueling a civil uprising demanding Ortega’s resignation. More than 100,000 Nicaraguans have since fled the country.Between the start of the protests and September 2019, 651 people died, nearly 5,000 were injured, 516 were kidnapped and 853 have gone missing, according to the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (ANPDH). Twenty-two police officers died, as stated by the U.N.According to Human Rights Watch, many of those detained during the protests were subjected to prosecution and torture, including electric shocks, asphyxiation and rape. Detainees were also reportedly denied care in public hospitals.The organization interviewed 12 former detainees, 11 of whom described suffering one of more forms of abuse, and seven who said they witnessed 39 detainees suffering abuses. It also interviewed three doctors and a psychologist who treated some detainees. They reported that many “showed signs of physical harm consistent with physical abuse and torture similar to that described by the 12 detainees.” NICARAGUA – A university student holds a sign reading 'Unity for political prisoners freedom' during a protest in Managua, on February 3, 2020. This week, Monitoreo Azul y Blanco (Blue and White Monitoring), a group that since 2018 registers and consolidates complaints of human rights violations in Nicaragua, published a video by Expediente Publico (an investigative journalism magazine in Honduras and Nicaragua) with testimonies from former political prisoners about their experiences of ill treatments and torture while incarcerated. The testimonies mentioned the details of the event that resulted in the death of Eddy Montes, a Nicaraguan-American and U.S. Navy veteran who was shot dead in La Modelo prison in May 2019 after “a serious disturbance” inside of the prison, according to Nicaragua's interior ministry.The magazine also published an article on October 20 detailing testimonies of victims of abuse by the Nicaraguan police. They tell the story of J, an opposition protestor who between May 6 and May 13, 2019, was subjected to “constant questioning” and abuse by the police. Her complaint is one of dozens of cases.Between April 2018 and June 2020, the Nicaraguan Human Rights Collective Never Again (Colectivo de Derechos Humanos Nicaragua Nunca+) registered complaints of five rapes, eight sexual abuses, seven threats of rape to detainees or their family members and three witnesses of rape to one or more fellow inmates, the article reported.NICARAGUA – Members of the organization Mothers of April (AMA) hold portraits of their late loved ones outside the Cathedral in Managua on February 23, 2020.On June 19, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a resolution to promote and protect human rights in Venezuela, and requesting the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to ""enhance monitoring” and “continue to report on the situation of human rights in Nicaragua.”Amid increased international pressure, Ortega’s government has released some political prisoners, including 91 people whose sentences were converted to house arrest in December 2019. But some 100 political prisoners (estimates vary slightly) remain in jails.On September 30, more than 50 political prisoners went on a hunger strike as part of protests demanding their freedom. At least three of them sewed their mouths as part of protests and were then transferred to maximum security cells at the Jorge Navarro prison complex known as La Modelo. Amnesty International has described the complex as “one of the main destinations for those detained and punished for reporting human rights violations in the country.”During his October 19 speech, Ortega said prison doors were open to those calling out the government, including relatives of prisoners, for them “to visit them when they say they’re being tortured, they are saying, they have sown their lips.” But on the following day, representatives from the Permanent Commission on Human Rights (CPDH), one of Nicaragua’s oldest rights groups, went to visit the prison and were not allowed in, as La Prensa reported.Allan Gomez, a member of the Union of Political Prisoners (UPPN), told Nicaragua Investiga that the denial of abuses is nothing new, “but human rights violations are fully visible.” Earlier this month, the U.S. imposed its latest round of sanctions on top Nicaraguan officials, including the attorney general. According to The Associated Press, about two dozen people close to Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, have been sanctioned – including Murillo and three of the couple’s children – since late 2017.

253;;;;Misleading;Modeste Bakwanamaha;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/congo-prison-break-fact-check/6742638.html;East Congo Mayor Downplays Size of Prison Break by Islamist Militants;2020-10-23;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On October 20, Modeste Bakwanamaha, mayor of the city of Beni in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), told Reuters by phone that “around 900” out of a total of “more than 1,000” prisoners held in the city’s jail were freed in an attack by Islamic militants.Bakwanamaha’s numbers are misleading: According to multiple other sources, not “around 900” but 1,337 prisoners escaped, and there were 1,447 inmates held in the jail, not merely “more than 1,000.”Reuters, which initially published a report with a headline “Suspected Islamists free 900 prisoners from east Congo jail,” citing mayor Bakwanamaha, later corrected the escapee figure to 1,300.The misleading figures presented by mayor Bakwanamaha are significant in light of the prolonged international criticism of Congolese authorities for the chronic inhumane conditions in a detention system that’s been neglected for decades.According to Human Rights Watch, prisons in the country are overcrowded and filled to quadruple capacity, with food deficiencies and “life-threatening” sanitary conditions, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic.The United Nations Mission in DRC also reported in May that prison congestion is a “particularly acute” issue, estimating that “capacity on average is being exceeded three-fold,” with challenges “including poor living and working conditions, and overstretched resources in terms of security, personnel, healthcare, sanitation and budget.”The Kangbayi central prison in Beni is no exception; it’s been populated at four times its capacity, journalists reported.The early morning attack on Kangbayi central prison on October 20, when armed men took away more than 1,300 inmates, was carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) jihadi group.According to the Site Intelligence Group, the Islamic State also took credit for the raid in east DR Congo that came “just days” after an October 18 call by the IS spokesman Abu Hamza al-Qurasani for prison breaks globally.Congolese prisoners are seen inside the Kangbayi central prison in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo, October 20, 2020.Although some terrorism experts dispute direct ties between IS and the ADF, others cite the two groups as confirming their affiliation and both referring to ADF as part of Islamic State’s “Central African Province.”ADF, formerly the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda, is one of the oldest militant groups in DR Congo, rooted in the eastern mountainous regions that are rich of mineral resources. The group is notorious for its grim record of attacks against civilians.The United Nations Human Rights office said in July that attacks by ADF may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.Democratic Republic of CongoArmed militants have previously attacked the same prison in Beni.

254;;;;Misleading;Ramzan Kadyrov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/chechnya-kadyrov-france-beheading/6742634.html;Kadyrov’s Delusive Claim That French Provoked Teacher’s Beheading;2020-10-22;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;On October 17, head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov posted a statement on his Telegram channel regarding the previous day’s deadly attack in France, where, according to law enforcement, a Chechen teenager had beheaded a teacher for demonstrating caricatures of Prophet Muhammed to his students.France -- A woman lights a candle on Republique Square during a demonstration Sunday Oct. 18, 2020 in Paris.Kadyrov is well-known for his brutal treatment of all dissent, and Chechnya has been a crucible for persecution of LGBTQ+ persons. The U.S. State Department’s human rights report for 2019 summarizes many of the allegations against Chechen authorities. In July 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued sanctions on Kadyrov and his family, citing “gross violations of human rights.”Yet Kadyrov, responding to the beheading, criticized France. “This is not the first time when France attempts to blame all its problems on the Chechens. I assure you all, Chechens have nothing to do with it,” Kadyrov wrote in a statement on the killing. “This tragedy forces to think about how the French society, speaking of democratism, often confuses it with permissiveness, with the demonstration of the unacceptable treatment of the Islamic values. Such actions can’t be called anything but provocative.” Citing French law enforcement’s brief detention of the killer’s relatives, Kadyrov complained that, “[W]hen we arrest terrorist accomplices – the whole world cries of human rights violations.” He also added that, “We condemn this act of terrorism” and “express condolences to the family of the diseased.”Kadyrov’s statement is misleading given Chechya’s record, and it misrepresents the response by French law enforcement.French President Emmanuel Macron pays his respects by the coffin of slain teacher Samuel Paty in the courtyard of the Sorbonne university during a national memorial event, in Paris, France October 21, 2020.The 18-year-old attacker, Abdullakh Anzorov, was an ethnic Chechen, born in Russia, who came to France with his family as a refugee seeking asylum. He was shot dead by the police soon after stabbing and then decapitating Samuel Paty, 47, a junior high school teacher in the Paris suburb. A few days earlier, Paty had displayed cartoons of Prophet Muhammed in his class on freedom of expression. Police said video and pictures of the attack shared via social media and messenger applications, with an accompanying text taking responsibility for the killing, were found on Anzorov’s mobile phone.Kadyrov’s claim that France blames all its problems on Chechens is disputed by his own countrymen. There is “no anti-Chechen hysteria in France’s society,” Mairbek Vatchagaev, a Chechen scholar and author living in Paris, wrote on his Telegram channel. “The only politician who suggested that there is something wrong with Chechens was the leader of the Insubordinate France political party Jean-Luc Melenchon, but even the French have little interest in his opinion,” Vatchagaev said. Melenchon remarked on the attack saying, “I think there is a problem with the Chechen community in France” and called for the expulsion of Chechens who act on Islamism, The Canadian reported. He later apologized for the “mistake.”Suleiman Djambulatov, leader of the Chechen association in France “Bart Marsho,” told the Russian outlet Caucasus Knot his organization is preparing a lawsuit against Melenchon accusing him of defamation and ethnic profiling.Gerald Darmanin, France’s minister of interior, called Melenchon’s comment about the Chechen community “unacceptable.”Kadyrov’s attempt to draw parallel between the detention of Anzorov’s relatives to the methods employed by the law enforcement in Chechnya is far-fetched. The French police released all the Anzorov family members on Tuesday after determining they were not complicit in the attack. None reported any abusive treatment while in custody.In comparison, Kadyrov stands accused of a “systemic practice of collective punishment” in Chechnya, where the law enforcement reportedly burned the houses of relatives and arrested and tortured family members of alleged insurgents and dissenters.RUSSIA -- Presiden Vladimir Putin (Left) talks to Chechen head Ramzan Kadyrov at Novo-Ogaryovo residence.There are recorded instances of entire families being expelled from Chechnya for allegedly aiding their kin militants.Similar tactics have been reportedly used under Kadyrov’s orders against Chechen journalists and bloggers critical of his rule. One of the latest cases is of the Chechen blogger Salman Tepsurkayev, who was running a Telegram channel that routinely hosted dissidents, including those critical of Kadyrov and the Kremlin. Tepsurkayev disappeared on September 5. The independent Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta reported that Tepsurkayev was kidnapped by the Kadyrov’s special operations unit and held at a secret compound near Grozny, the capital.On September 7, the 19-year-old Tepsurkayev appeared in a widely shared social media video, naked and standing on his knees. He introduced himself as the administrator of the anti-Kadyrov Telegram channel 1ADAT and then sat on a glass bottle, saying, “I am punishing myself for spreading lies.” Human Rights Watch said the blogger’s case “once again highlights the Chechen leaderships’ unrelenting brutality and Moscow’s active tolerance of their lawlessness and violence.” Tepsurkayev is still missing.Russia. Chechnya. The abduction of Salman Tepsurkayev. A screen grab from the video provided by the Committee against Torture.Lastly, Kadyrov’s condemnation of the beheading came amid praise for the killer by the two Chechen members of his mixed martial arts club, “Akhmat MMA,” which he named after his father.Zelim Imadaev, a professional mixed martial arts fighter who competes on the world arenas, posted a picture of Anzorov on his Instagram feed with the caption, “The Hero of Islam.” On September 5, Imadaev lost a UFC fight to Brazilian Michael Pereira in Las Vegas, Nev.Another mixed martial arts fighter, Albert Duraev wrote, “In France, the free speech lost its beginning” finishing the sentence with a laughing emoji. Both later deleted their posts and Instagram suspended their accounts.Kadyrov takes special pride in having his own martial arts club and keeps close relations with its members. Four years ago, he made his toddler son fight in the arena on live TV, sparking a controversy.The cartoons that Paty displayed in the class were published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo first in 2012, then in 2015, prompting a revenge attack by Islamist militants that killed 17 people, including 11 of the magazine’s employees.Chechnya -- Ramzan Kadyrov (R) rides in a Rolls-Royce Cabriolet as he escorts the Muslim relics, Prophet Muhammad's cup and carpets, from an airport to Grozny central mosque, Sep. 21, 2011.“We will not allow anyone to offend our Prophet Muhammed! The one who attempts to do that, that one is our enemy! For us there is no difference between the Wahhabi extremists and those printing caricatures,” Kadyrov wrote back in 2015 on his now deleted Instagram page.Charlie Hebdo republished the caricatures again in September after the trial of 14 suspects in 2015 attack opened in the Paris court.In late September, two employees of a French TV production company were attacked by a man with a meat cleaver near the former Charlie Hebdo offices. The suspect said he was enraged by publication of the cartoons.The trial is expected to continue into November.;https://t.me/RKadyrov_95/1008,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-security-idUKKBN2720BG,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/10/video-demonstrates-chechnya-leaderships-brutality#,https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RUSSIA-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf,https://www.state.gov/public-designation-of-russian-national-ramzan-kadyrov-due-to-involvement-in-gross-violations-of-human-rights/,https://news.yahoo.com/france-clamps-down-closes-mosque-144154618.html,https://thecanadian.news/2020/10/20/melenchon-admits-an-error-after-his-remarks-on-the-chechens/,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/355535,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/355535/,https://t.me/mairbekv/1308,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/beheaded-teacher-france-7-face-possible-charges/,https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/02/russia-stop-collective-punishment-chechnya#,https://oc-media.org/kadyrov-officially-sanctions-collective-responsibility-for-families-of-terrorists/,https://www.rferl.org/a/chechen-teen-who-appeared-in-humiliation-video-was-kidnapped-russian-paper-says/30829825.html,https://www.hrw.org/node/376356/printable/print,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/355558/,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/355492,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2722292-ramzan-kadyrov-the-most-dangerous-man-in-mma-is-not-a-fighter,https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4412812/zelim-imadaev,https://www.gazeta.ru/sport/2020/10/19/a_13323775.shtml,https://www.polygraph.info/a/chechnya-kadyrov-social-media-surveilance-/28983182.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/kadyrov-children-mma-mixed-martial-arts-criticism-russia/28035237.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-charlie-hebdo/30833696.html,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/355492,https://cpj.org/2020/09/as-police-investigate-fresh-attack-amid-charlie-hebdo-trial-french-media-unify-around-free-expression/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/world/europe/france-attack-suspect-terrorism.html;Kadyrov’s Delusive Claim That French Provoked Teacher’s Beheading;;;;;;

October 18, 2020. One year after the popular mobilization.""  The tweet is incorrect. The photo Marin posted actually was from protests in 2019.Marin’s colleague, Paola Dragnic (a correspondent of teleSUR), vehemently defended its authenticity even as other Twitter users raised questions of misrepresentation.Chile's president, Sebastian Pinera has been a vocal opponent of Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicholas Maduro and his government, and vice-versa. In January 2019, Pinera joined the United States and other countries in recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s president after a disputed election.And in April, Pinera said on Twitter: “We reiterate our full support for President Guaido and democracy in Venezuela. Maduro's dictatorship must end by the peaceful force, and within the constitution of the Venezuelan people. This will restore freedom, democracy, human rights and progress in #Venezuela."" To be sure, Pinera has been the target of persistent protests. In early October 2019, a 4 percent fare increase in Chile’s capital, Santiago de Chile, metro system ignited mass demonstrations over economic and other inequalities. Students used social media to organize rallies against transit fares, occupying and rioting at stations and later taking unrest to the streets. As demonstrations grew, Pinera called for a state of emergency and sent troops to respond. Pinera imposed curfews nationwide – but he also rolled back the fare increase and promised to address economic issues. The moves failed to quell longstanding grievances. “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years,” one protest slogan goes.CHILE -– A demonstrator protects himself from the spray of a police water cannon with a makeshift shield during a protest against the government in Santiago, on November 26, 2019. A year after demonstrations began, they have resumed with smaller crowds.The photo posted by Marin is from Plaza Baquedano, in the capital, Santiago de Chile. Marin’s post was then retweeted by Venezuela’s minister of foreign affairs, Jorge Arreaza, and by Maduro himself.Half an hour after her post, another Twitter user commented that the photo was from 2019, to which Dragnic responded by publishing a different photo from the square, saying “No ma'am, it's not 2019.” Dragnic went on to publish the same photo as a rebuttal to a different user who also disputed the date.Polygraph.info examined both photos by Marin and Dragnic and found them to be from different years.Each photo shows an object extending out from the crowd. In the photo on the left (below, from Marin’s original tweet) Chile’s flag stands out – whereas the photo on the right (below, from Dragnic) shows a white banner.  Side by side photos of Chile protests in Baquedano Square. On the left side is the photo shared by Patricia Villegas Marin, and on the right side the one shared by Paola Dragnic. The same flag was visible during mass gatherings in Baquedano Square on October 25, 2019, (as seen in this video). On that day, an estimated 1 million people marched in Chile’s capital, Santiago, calling for, among other things, Pinera's resignation. That day marked the largest gathering to date.Galeria CIMA, an art gallery in Santiago located by Baquedano Square – and which has started to broadcast livestreams of the plaza since October 2019 – captured both events in 2019 and 2020.At the 4:23 hour mark in the 2019 video, a large Chilean flag is set up by the crowd in the bottom center of the frame, with writing saying ""#Chile desperto” (“Chile woke up”) and “#no estamos en guerra” (“we are not at war”). The flag then makes its way further into the crowd.Screenshot from Galeria CIMA's Youtube video on October 25, 2019. A reverse image search shows the exact photo Marin published circulating on social media last year. It was published in a tweet from October 26, 2019, stating, “More than 1 million people got together to be part of the largest march in the history of Chile. Oct 25, 2019. Chile fights for its future,” as well as in an October 27 post on 9gag, the Hong Kong-based, user-generated social platform.  In Galeria CIMA's 2020 video, people appear at the top of the video frame at around 12:30 p.m. (34:09 in the video) with the distinct white banner.  Screenshot from Galeria CIMA's Youtube video on October 18, 2020. A minute later, the banner is erected. The stream also shows considerably fewer people in 2020 when compared with the 2019 demonstration. Screenshot from Galeria CIMA's Youtube video on October 18, 2020. Maduro himself tweeted a video on October 26, 2019, showing the protests on the capital’s square, writing that “the prophecy of Salvador Allende and Víctor Jara was fulfilled, the wide avenues have been opened, through them free men and women who rebel against the neoliberalism that oppresses and generates inequality pass. Long live Chile! Long live the Great Homeland!” Salvador Allende was a Marxist politician and the 28th president of Chile, having won the 1970 elections. His presidency, however, did not please then president Richard Nixon — who ordered the CIA to oust him. Jara was a Chilean activist-folk singer who was killed after the coup that installed Gen. Augusto Pinochet.On September 11, 1973, the military junta led by Pinochet seized power and ended three years of socialist rule. Allende killed himself as troops stormed the presidential palace.Chile’s Pinera was the first conservative president to rule the country since the end of its dictatorship in 1990. He was first elected in 2010 and served for four years until being replaced by socialist Michelle Bachelet. Pinera was re-elected in 2018.";https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-chile/chile-recognizes-opposition-leader-guaido-as-venezuelas-president-idUSKCN1PH2L0,https://twitter.com/sebastianpinera/status/1123216919635664898,https://twitter.com/hashtag/Venezuela?src=hashtag_click,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/world/americas/chile-protests-pinera.html,https://twitter.com/pvillegas_tlSUR/status/1317971454785355777,https://twitter.com/PaoladrateleSUR/status/1318020094015012865/photo/1,http://ttps://www.pond5.com/es/stock-footage/item/118730775-12-millions-people-protesting-against-goverment-and-system-p,https://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/personas-protestan-santiago-chile-medio-estallido-social.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMaSEx506p0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INkqL1gaD2w,https://9gag.com/gag/aMYYPvW,https://twitter.com/NicolasMaduro/status/1188154371680473096,https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/us/victor-jara.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11558721;Venezuelan Officials, Taking a Swipe at Chile, Misrepresent Protest Photos;;;;;;
256;;;;Misleading;Gerhard Schroeder;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-schroeder-navalny-poisoning/6742608.html;Taking Russia’s Side, Germany’s Ex-Chancellor Questions Navalny Poisoning;2020-10-02;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Germany’s ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has questioned whether leading Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, as the German government maintains and testing labs in France and Sweden have determined.According to Der Spiegel, Schroder said in a podcast he produces that the German government’s assessment is “essentially speculation” and claimed that “there are no reliable facts” establishing that Navalny was poisoned when returning to Moscow from an August trip to Siberia.Der Spiegel said Schroeder called on the German government to agree to the joint investigation proposed by Russia and hand over all data in Navalny’s case.Schroder’s claim that “there are no reliable facts” establishing that Navalny was poisoned is misleading.Apart from a specialized laboratory in Germany, two independent facilities in France and Sweden tested Navalny’s samples and reported the presence of Novichok, a class of military grade nerve agents that were developed by the Soviet Union.GERMANY -- A poster with a picture of Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny captioned ""poisoned"" is seen outside the Russian embassy on Unter den Linden in Berlin, Sept. 23, 2020.Russia has denied any involvement in Navalny’s illness and disputed that he was poisoned. Instead, Russian narratives of what happened to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic have included self-poisoning, metabolic disorder, alcohol poisoning and a drug overdose.Most recently, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia has “intelligence” that Navalny was working with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. (In response, Navalny said the claim is false and that he will sue for defamation.)Navalny, 44, is out of the hospital and recovering in Berlin, where he was taken for treatment that involved inducing a coma. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in September that there was “unequivocal proof” Navalny was poisoned in what she termed an effort to silence him.“This raises very difficult questions that only the Russian government can answer, and has to answer,” Merkel said.Schroeder reportedly developed a close friendship with Putin during his time as Germany’s chancellor. He currently serves as the head of the board of directors of the Nord Stream AG pipeline construction company, which built two natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany. He is also chairman of the supervisory board of Rosneft, the Russia oil giant.Nord Stream AG’s sister company Nord Stream 2 AG, which is wholly owned by Russia’s giant natural gas monopoly Gazprom, is in charge of a 746-mile-long pipeline project to bring natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. The $11 billion project is nearly complete but has been hobbled by sanctions the U.S. has imposed or threatened due to fears over European dependence on Russian energy and “threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.”RUSSIA – Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schroeder, city of Vyborg, Sept. 6, 2011.Some German politicians have suggested canceling the Nord Stream 2 project in retaliation for the Navalny poisoning. The New York Times quoted a member of Germany’s parliament, Norbert Rottgen, as saying: “We need to respond with the only language that Putin understands, the language of natural gas.”Schroeder’s description of Navalny’s poisoning as “speculation” unsubstantiated by “reliable facts” echoes claims made by Russian officials, who have demanded that Germany provide medical information, including biological samples, to support their poisoning claim.According to a Deutsche Welle report, Christian Democrats and the Green Party politicians have called on Schroeder step down from ""all his positions in Russia,"" accusing him of ""lobbying for the Kremlin."" Novichok is categorized as a chemical weapon of mass destruction and is prohibited by the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

One hundred volunteers there will take part in the clinical trials beginning Oct. 1, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), developer of the vaccine, announced on Sept. 28.The Russian health ministry approved the vaccine on Aug. 11 ahead of final phase 3 clinical trials, which were launched 17 days later.Denis Loginov, lead scientist at Moscow’s Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed the vaccine, defended its speedy approval. Sputnik V is based on the Ebola virus vaccine, which took the center 20 years to develop. “We simply changed the warhead of this rocket,” Loginov said.RUSSIA -- A nurse inoculates volunteer Ilya Dubrovin, 36, with Russia's new coronavirus vaccine in a post-registration trials at a clinic in Moscow, Sept. 10, 2020.Sputnik V is a two-shot vaccine, delivered with three weeks between doses. It uses live human adenovirus as a vehicle to deliver a weakened SARS-CoV-2 gene, in order to induce a protective immune system response to the coronavirus. Adenoviruses are natural viruses that can cause a variety of cold or flu-like symptoms, which typically are mild. Because these viruses are common, one obstacle for an adenovirus-based vaccine is that some individuals may have antibodies in their system that will attack the vaccine itself.Fingertip-sized patches with dissolvable microscopic needles, a potential COVID-19 vaccine, are seen at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Commenting on the participation of Belarusian volunteers, Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, made several claims about the “Western developers” of competing vaccines.Dmitriev claimed they had postponed introducing their vaccines in civilian trials, thus sabotaging the fight against the coronavirus. He also claimed the Western vaccines relied on “experimental technologies,” while Sputnik V employed the human adenovirus platform, which has been proven safe over decades of studies. Those assertions are false. First, the Russian vaccine is not the only adenovirus-based coronavirus vaccine. The World Health Organization’s database of 191 vaccine candidates includes at least 11 that use similar technology. Forty are at the same clinical evaluation stage as Russia’s Sputnik V, but approval is pending until the required human trials are completed. At least seven out of the 40 vaccines already in the final evaluation stage are, in fact, adenovirus based. These include two Chinese, two Italian and two U.S. versions.Dmitriev’s claim that the “Western” developers have postponed clinical testing ignores reality. Other vaccine developers are adhering to standard multiphase testing procedures, while Russia has abandoned such procedures, having approved its vaccine before final, large-scale tests were conducted.The standard human testing protocol involves three stages: small-group tests to see if the vaccine produces immunity, Phase 1; larger test on several hundred people that also may involve use of placebos, Phase 2; and widespread testing involving placebos and randomization on tens of thousands of people to establish how effective the vaccine is and identify any problematic side effects, Phase 3. In this last phase, patients aren’t told if they have received the vaccine or a placebo.A handout photo provided by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) shows samples of a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in Moscow, Russia August 6, 2020.According to Sputnik V’s website, the Russian developers have been strictly following all the normal steps required for vaccine approval. The large-scale trial of Sputnik V that started in August aims to involve 40,000 volunteers. The researchers at the Gamaleya Center refer to it as the “post-approval clinical studies.”The Russian journalist Andrey Abramov, who volunteered for the ongoing Sputnik V trial, shared what was written in the consent forms he was asked to sign. He wrote that the only information about previous tests described the trials on Syrian hamsters, monkeys and a single human trial of 21 volunteers. The latter would correspond with a Phase I trial.It is unclear whether the consent form information is complete; the forms are not publicly available, and Polygraph.info could not confirm Abramov’s account. Dmitriev’s claim that the human adenovirus vector-based vaccines were tested for decades and proven to be safe is partly true. However, although the technology is well-studied, it is currently used only in one commercial vaccine, against rabies.Moreover, the potential effectiveness of human adenovirus-based vaccines remains a matter of debate. Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine researcher at Flinders University in Australia, has said that human adenovirus-based vaccines “don’t work” if they are too weak but “become toxic” when too strong. They also can be problematic in certain demographic groups with weakened immune systems.Questions about the safety of the Russian vaccine arose after it was approved in August. The leading U.S. virus expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he “seriously” doubted Sputnik V’s safety.“We have half a dozen or more vaccines,” Fauci told National Geographic magazine in August. “So, if we wanted to take the chance of hurting a lot of people or giving them something that doesn't work, we could start doing this, you know, next week if we wanted to. But that's not the way it works.”Danny Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, warned of potential “collateral damage” from the release of a vaccine “that was less than safe and effective.” The consequences “would exacerbate our current problems insurmountably,” he said.The WHO “cautioned” Russia not to “compromise on safety.”Responding to the criticism, on Sept. 4, the Russian health ministry published a report on the first two phases of Sputnik V’s testing in the British medical journal The Lancet.RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, meets with Kirill Dmitriyev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, January 17, 2020.“The publication in one of the world’s leading medical magazines the Lancet confirms the high safety and effectiveness of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V and demonstrates the recognition of the Russian scientists by the world scientific society,” Dmitriev said in a statement released on the same day.However, the Russian report only increased alarm and doubt among the scientists who read it. Some 40 scientists from nine countries signed an open letter questioning the data. Then 15 scientists from different countries sent a formal letter to The Lancet detailing their concerns about the accuracy of the Russian data.Alexander Ginsburg, director of the Gamaleya Center, defended Sputnik V in a Sept. 29 interview with Russian media. A “properly vaccinated” person develops “certain number of antibodies” and is permanently immune against coronavirus, Ginsburg said. Only a small proportion of people do not “respond to the vaccine” - about 5-10 per cent, he said.RUSSIA -- The director of Nikolai Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Alexander Ginsburg attends a meeting of the Collegium of Russia's Ministry of Health.On Sept. 24, Russia announced that the residents of all its regions and foreigners could volunteer for the Sputnik V trial, dropping the requirement that only Moscow residents could volunteer.Abramov said the consent form had several “odd things” – a disclaimer that “the effects of the vaccine on male sperm are unknown” and a requirement not to conceive children for at least three months after the vaccination. He also reported that shot had made him “very sick,” causing a high fever and hallucinations for two days. In addition, he wrote that his girlfriend broke up with him because she “really wanted to have children,” and he “forgot to ask her” before signing up for the trial. There is a popular conspiracy in Russia that Sputnik V permanently affects male fertility.The Russian Direct Investment Fund said more than 50 countries have formally applied for Sputnik V and that supply agreements have been reached with Mexico (32 million doses), Brazil (50 million doses), India(100 million doses) and Uzbekistan(35 million doses). The first deliveries can begin as early as this November.RUSSIA -- An emergency doctor wearing protective equipment transports a woman to a hospital for COVID-19 patients in St. Petersburg, September 24, 2020.Domestically, the distribution of Sputnik V is far more limited: 50 free doses have been promised to each of Russia’s regions. Meanwhile, the country is reportedly facing “dramatic rises” of infection.As of Sept. 29, the number of confirmed infections in Russia exceeded 1 million, with more than 20,000 deaths.";https://rdif.ru/fullNews/5829/,https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/,https://www.kp.ru/daily/217182/4287066/,https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/sputnik-v-vaccine,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/adenovirus.html,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/fourth-large-scale-covid-19-vaccine-trial-begins-united-states,https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation,https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/top-5-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-explained,https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/,https://rdif.ru/fullNews/5706/,https://www.mos.ru/city/projects/covid-19/vaccine/,https://www.kp.ru/daily/217187.5/4293464/,https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/Adenoviral-vectors-new-COVID-19/98/i19,https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/vector-based-vaccines-come-to-the-fore-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-67915,https://www.axios.com/fauci-doubts-russia-coronavirus-vaccine-safe-1ec5b7de-8b66-450b-a8af-e7f2dc87d920.html,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/08/fauci-seriously-doubts-russia-coronavirus-vaccine-is-ready-cvd/?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=social::src=twitter::cmp=editorial::add=tw20200811science-faucirussiavaccinecoronavirus::rid=#close,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-putin-intl/index.html,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/who-cautions-russia-on-covid-19-vaccine/1938509,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext,https://rdif.ru/fullNews/5714/,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2GB5JJ,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9584209,https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/80238073/,https://www.kp.ru/daily/217187.5/4293464/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-strikes-deals-to-sell-its-coronavirus-vaccine-internationally-11600610554,http://windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2020/09/will-moscow-send-its-coronavirus.html,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html;Developer of Russia’s Sputnik V Falsely Claims that ‘the West’ is Foot-Dragging on a Vaccine;;;;;;
258;;;;Misleading;Sergey Lavrov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/vote-by-mail-russia-fact-check/6742588.html;Russia’s Two Minds on Vote by Mail;2020-09-17;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On Sept. 3 the intelligence analysts at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned federal and state law enforcement that Russian actors were working to undermine faith in the U.S. election.A redacted version of the evidence has been released to the public. The unclassified document says there “high confidence,” that “Russian state media, proxies, state-controlled social media trolls are likely to promote allegations of corruption, system failure, and foreign malign interference to sow distrust in democratic institutions and election outcomes.”The report specifically cited disinformation about the validity of mail balloting, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly disparaged with unproven assertions of widespread fraud and potential manipulation. The Washington Post fact checker called it a “fusillade of falsehoods” by Trump in a comprehensive examination of his claims.Trump’s conservative backers, including the Heritage Foundation, a longtime vote-by-mail critic, have amplified his assertions about the potential for fraud, which are disputed by academics, other think tanks and past the experience of states where vote-by-mail is routine practice.The U.S. assessment of Russian interference is based on the analysis by the DHS Cyber Mission Center in coordination with DHS agencies.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded to the U.S. charge of undermining vote-by-mail. ""Although, sometimes we still get surprised. I mean the recent statement, which voiced accusations against Russia that we are trying to abuse and utilize in the interests of one or another candidate the planned in the U.S mail in vote,” Lavrov said in remarks on Sept. 11. “I was amazed by such an accusation because up until now I thought, that the mail in vote was a problem between president Trump, who categorically does not want to allow such voting, and the Democrats, who require spreading mail-in vote to a maximum.”That is misleading.The Russian state-owned media have played up the vote-by-mail and election fraud coverage, as shown in the R-T (Russia Today) coverage below.EmbedshareThe Russian state-owned media have played up the vote-by-mail and election fraud coverage, as shown in the RT coverage below.EmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:00:410:00Domestically, the topic also seems to be closely watched. Yandex.ru, the Russian search engine similar to Google, returns more than 9 million results for “mail in vote in the U.S.”; that number rises to more than 11 million when the key words are “mail in vote in the U.S. + Trump.”Much of the interest is in news reports about Trump’s tweets or interviews on vote in mail. And the most dominant headlines focus on his opposition to vote-by-mail. The arguments vary from “the entire democratic system in the U.S. is falling apart” to the “vote-in-mail will turn the states deep blue,” that is, from Republican (Trump’s party – red) to Democrat (opponent Joe Biden’s – blue).The Sept. 4 analysis published by the Russian state-owned Sputnik, for instance, predicts “an inevitable bloody November” if the U.S. votes by mail, because the voting results on the election night will be very different from the finals, which will include the ballots sent by mail. “The most likely scenario this will create resembles that of a cheap Hollywood civil war blockbuster,” the Sputnik report predicts before going into the apocalyptic details of the “bloody electoral drama unfolding in the U.S.” with the victor not Trump or Biden but a “total chaos” -- all because of vote in mail system.Another most prevalent narrative in the Russian reports is the speculation about mass falsifications, the opportunity for which, according to the Russian experts, the mail voting presents to the U.S. Democratic Party, though they fail to explain how exactly the Democrats are more equipped to manipulate U.S. post offices.While Russian state media are critical of mail balloting in the U.S., it’s getting carefully worded positive attention in Moscow. The Russian Central Election Commission is reportedly “studying” the U.S. vote-by-mail system for its potential application domestically. On Sept. 11, Marsel Garayev, the election monitoring expert in Russia’s region of Tatarstan praised the U.S. vote-by-mail system as one of the world’s most successful time-tested democratic election tools. A duality of narratives is not a novelty for the Russian state media. They frequently target different messaging to the U.S. public and domestic audiences, as Polygraph.info reported in this fact check about Black Lives Matter protests in major U.S. cities. Lavrov dismissed the U.S. intelligence report. “So, frankly speaking, we’ve got used to such attacks. In this case, just like in the case of poisonings in other countries of the world, we will go by concrete facts if they are presented to us,” he said.The poisoning reference was in apparent response to German, U.S. and European allegations that leading opposition figure Alexey Navalny was confirmed to be poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent while on political travel in Siberia last month.Navalny is recovering in Germany. The Kremlin has steadfastly disputed any involvement or that the agent Novichok was used.";https://www.scribd.com/document/474711820/DHS-Russia-Intel-Sept-3-2020-Voting-w-Redactions,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/11/trumps-fusillade-falsehoods-mail-voting/,https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/trump-suggests-we-may-need-redo-presidential-election-possible,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/02/low-rates-of-fraud-in-vote-by-mail-states-show-the-benefits-outweigh-the-risks/,https://scholars.org/sites/scholars/files/ssn_key_findings_minnite_on_the_myth_of_voter_fraud.pdf,https://www.dhs.gov/mission-centers,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2020/09/1/14/14f86315-a4b1-4387-bf3b-940b3ee0ebb8_240p.mp4,/a/vote-by-mail-russia-fact-check/6741177.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741177.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741177.html&text=The+Russian+state-owned+media+have+played+up+the+vote-by-mail+and+election+fraud+coverage%2c+as+shown+in+the+RT+coverage+below.,/a/6741177.html,/embed/player/Article/6741177.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://yandex.ru/search/?text=%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%87%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%B2%20%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B0&lr=109838,https://yandex.ru/search/?text=%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%87%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%B2%20%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B0%20%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF&lr=109838,https://rg.ru/2020/09/13/tramp-nazval-provalnymi-vse-vybory-s-golosovaniem-po-pochte.html,https://tjournal.ru/analysis/194733-sinee-smeshchenie-i-pole-dlya-falsifikaciy-kak-ustroeno-pochtovoe-golosovanie-v-ssha-i-pochemu-ego-opasaetsya-tramp,https://uz.sputniknews.ru/columnists/20200904/14904207/Izbirateli-pod-prikrytiem-SShA-obrecheny-na-krovavyy-noyabr.html,https://vz.ru/news/2020/9/4/1058619.html,https://tass.ru/politika/9408391,https://www.tatar-inform.ru/news/politics/11-09-2020/ekspert-mnogodnevnoe-golosovanie-uspeshno-ispolzuyut-v-ssha-i-evrope-5770607,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-george-floyd-protests/30653379.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/novichok-navalny-poisoned-russia-fact-check/30817598.html,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=salisbury&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10;Russia’s Two Minds on Vote by Mail;;;;;;

Hamilton Mourao;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-brazilian-leaders-rebut-criticism-of-amazon-fires-with-bizarre-video/6742582.html;Brazilian Leaders Rebut Criticism of Amazon Fires with Misleading Video, Squishy Numbers;2020-09-13;polygraph;Mariana Castro;"On Sept. 2, the Articulation of Indigenous People of Brazil (APIB) tweeted a video about a new campaign, called “Defund Bolsonaro,” which urges investors and international corporations doing business with the country to push for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. The video, narrated by children, starts with the question, “Can you smell the smoke? The Amazon forest is burning, again.” It closes with more questions: “Which side are you on? The Amazon or Bolsonaro?”  A week later, Brazil's vice president, Gen. Hamilton Mourao, and minister of the environment, Ricardo Salles, published a video to counter the campaign. Also narrated by a child, it began with: “Are you smelling smoke? Of course not! Because the Amazon is not burning again.”The video goes on to say the Amazon biome is home to 1 million farmers, most from indigenous communities and small producers, with only 5 percent using fires to clear land and plant. “Therefore, these fires are cultural and of small proportion,” the narrator says. The video also claims Brazil is the country that most preserves forests, with 66.3 percent of its native forests protected, and that only 29 percent of Brazil’s land is designated for food production: “[T]he food you consume is produced in a responsible and sustainable way. The most sustainable in the world.” Speaking in support of the video on Sept. 9, Mourao exclaimed: ""Brazil is the country that most preserves its native forests in the world. That's the truth. We take care!”  That characterization is misleading. In fact, data show that deforestation in the Amazon hit a 10-year high in 2019, and that pressure on the rainforest continues, according to researchers and first-hand accounts alike.Nonetheless, the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the pace of deforestation since he took office in 2019 and provided questionable statistics or assessments. For instance, as Polygraph.info noted in June, 59 percent of the Brazil’s land is forested (second only to Russia), not 66.3 percent, as the video says. Last year, Brazil recorded the world’s biggest loss of tropical primary forests, accounting for one-third of the overall global decrease, or 1.36 million hectares, roughly the area of Connecticut – according to satellite imagery analysis for loss of tree covers conducted by the University of Maryland. Ninety-five percent of the decline happened in the Amazon rainforest.  Deforestation between August 2018 and July 2019 reached 3,800 square miles, up 30 percent compared to the same period of 2017 and 2018, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Fires in the Amazon have continued this year. ""There aren't two sides. There is no 'the Amazon is burning' or 'the Amazon isn't burning.' There's only the side of evidence. You can have access to the fires through satellites from INPE and NASA,"" said Christian Braga, a Brazilian photographer and documentarian whose work has focused on the Amazon and its communities for the past eight years. Braga documented the fires with Greenpeace in July and August. He said occurrences were up: “We flew over five states, and in August we saw illegal burning of both pasture, which was banned, in theory since July 16 … and also forest burning."" BRAZIL -- Smoke billows from forest fires in the municipality of Candeias do Jamari, close to Porto Velho in Rondonia State, in the Amazon basin, August 24, 2019.In June, the number of fires in the Amazon biome (2,248) was the highest since 2007, according to data from the Fire Program (Programa Queimadas) of INPE, which monitors fires around different Brazilian ecosystems. Amid an increase of the spread of fires and pressure from business and investors, fires have been banned in the Amazon since July 16 for 120 days. Although outbreaks overall fell by 5 percent in August compared to a year ago, the number of fires increased by 7.8 percent in protected areas, according to Greenpeace. However, due to a technical issue in NASA's satellite tracking fires on Aug. 16, monitoring in some areas of the country are lagging behind.In the first week of September, 8,373 fire outbreaks were already registered in the Amazon, up 13 percent from August, according to Reuters. Most of these fires are not being started by people in traditional communities or to clear pasture by small ranchers. Rather, most are by land grabbers known as grileiros.“Satellite data shows that the areas where the fire is taking place are not traditional communities, they are forests and newly deforested areas,” Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental organizations, told Polygraph.info.“Fires for cleaning pasture or grass doesn’t create these columns of fire in the Amazon,"" he said. ""What creates these columns are environmental crimes.”During his trip, Braga saw that many of the areas that were burning last year had become pastures, some with cattle. “It confirms that many of the fires weren’t natural. They happened illegally and purposefully,” he said.MATO GROSSO – Smoke rises from a burnt area of land a the Xingu Indigenous Park, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, in the Amazon basin, on August 6, 2020.

According to a 2019 analysis by the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM), about 34 percent of fires are in newly deforested areas – the final step for squatters to take over the land. Thirty percent were forest fires – with a goal of burning forests to then occupy them or incorporate them into farms – and 36 percent were in farmlands – used for management, renewal of pasture and elimination of grass pests.In September, 27 percent of the largest fires were in virgin forests, according to an analysis from the non-governmental organization Amazon Conservation, Reuters reported.

When it comes to sustainability in food production, Brazil is far from being “the most sustainable in the world.”According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Brazil is third-highest in pesticide use, behind only China and the United States. As for greenhouse gas, Brazil is the seventh-largest emitter, according to Climate Watch.   The Defund Bolsonaro campaign is the latest initiative by a wide range of organizations, investors and governments to urge action on deforestation of the Amazon. At the end of July, three of the biggest private banks in Brazil jointly released an integrated plan for Amazon conservation and sustainable development. Also that month, the investment firm Nordea Asset Management dropped from its funds the Brazilian meat giant, JBS SA, over its role in deforestation, among other issues, The Wall Street Journal reported.Brazil’s plans to participate in a trade pact between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American Free Trade Zone, was put on hold in 2019 over concerns about the Amazon. Bolsonaro's government continues to defend its environmental protection record. In a July radio interview, Mourao said, “Rest assured enforcement continues to happen, and with good results.” Speaking this week to journalists about the “Defund Bolsonaro” rebuttal video, he said: ""Those groups that consider that we are not dealing properly with the Amazon issue do their propaganda work. We have to do the counter propaganda. This is part of the deal.""";https://twitter.com/ApibOficial/status/1301133212840796165,https://www.defundbolsonaro.org/,https://twitter.com/GeneralMourao/status/1303868724513038341,https://twitter.com/rsallesmma/status/1303820431166705665,http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/deforestation/biomes/legal_amazon/increments,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-brazil-bolsonaro-deforestation/30662765.html,https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/06/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019,https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/global/?map=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&menu=eyJkYXRhc2V0Q2F0ZWdvcnkiOiIiLCJtZW51U2VjdGlvbiI6IiJ9,https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/11/18/desmatamento-na-amazonia-cresce-entre-agosto-de-2018-e-julho-de-2019-diz-inpe.ghtml,https://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/blog/agosto-tem-queimadas-sem-controle-na-amazonia/,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2020/07/em-junho-amazonia-teve-maior-numero-de-queimadas-dos-ultimos-13-anos.shtml,https://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/blog/agosto-tem-queimadas-sem-controle-na-amazonia/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-fires/brazils-amazon-fires-worsen-in-september-threaten-virgin-forests-idUSKBN2601NP,https://ipam.org.br/fogo-em-area-recem-desmatada-na-amazonia-disparou-em-2019/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-fires/brazils-amazon-fires-worsen-in-september-threaten-virgin-forests-idUSKBN2601NP,http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data/RP/visualize,https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?chartType=line&end_year=2016&regions=TOP&source=CAIT&start_year=1990,https://www.dw.com/pt-br/maiores-bancos-privados-do-brasil-se-unem-em-defesa-da-amaz%C3%B4nia/a-54276966,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nordea-asset-management-drops-jbs-over-deforestation-corruption-worker-health-11595963107,https://www.dw.com/en/austria-deals-first-blow-to-eu-mercosur-trade-pact/a-50489747,https://www.gov.br/pt-br/noticias/meio-ambiente-e-clima/2020/07/em-programa-de-radio-mourao-fala-sobre-fiscalizacao-na-amazonia,https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/09/10/mourao-e-salles-compartilham-video-com-animal-da-mata-atlantica-para-rebater-criticas-sobre-queimadas-na-amazonia.ghtml;Brazilian Leaders Rebut Criticism of Amazon Fires with Misleading Video, Squishy Numbers;;;;;;
260;;;;Misleading;Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-charlie-hebdo/6742580.html;Iran’s Supreme Leader Spins Charlie Hebdo Case Into a Western Conspiracy;2020-09-11;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"The French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo republished controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad last week as the trial of 14 suspects in the deadly 2015 terror attack on the outlet began in Paris.Seventeen people, including 11 employees of the weekly, died in the January 2015 rampage, which the Islamist militants said was in “revenge” for the magazine’s publication in 2006 and 2012 of cartoons depicting the Muslim holy figure.The artwork of French street artist Christian Guemy aka ""C215"" depicting members of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo is painted on a facade near the magazine's offices at Rue Nicolas Appert, on Jan. 7, 2020 in Paris.In Iran, protesters responded to the re-publication by burning Israeli and U.S. flags in front of the French Embassy in Tehran on Sept. 9.A day earlier, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, addressed the nation, accusing the U.S. and “Zionists” of using Charlie Hebdo to “distract the nations and governments of West Asia” from their “sinister plots.”“The cardinal and unforgivable sin of a French magazine in insulting the holy face of the Prophet once again revealed the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community,” Khamenei said.That characterization is misleading.Overlooked by Khamenei: Charlie Hebdo has aimed its satire at other religions, not just Islam. And Western politicians at times have criticized the magazine for going too far.Charlie Hebdo is a satirical, atheist and far-left publication that regularly targets a broad array of institutions. According to the BBC, the magazine is part of a tradition in French journalism going back to the 18th century that “combines left-wing radicalism with a provocative scurrility that often borders on the obscene.” The magazine’s original version, a monthly publication called Hara-Kiri, was established in 1960 and banned twice by the government – in 1961 and 1966. It has operated since 1970 under the name Charlie Hebdo. Over time, the magazine has been accused of anti-Semitism and published cartoons mocking Jesus, the Catholic Church and disaster victims.Charlie Hebdo cartoon, captioned: “Italians, it is not Charlie Hebdo that built your homes, it’s the mafia!”To take just one example of the magazine’s in-your-face style, editors in 2016 published a cartoon depicting the corpses from an Italian earthquake as filling in a lasagne. After outraged politicians condemned the insensitivity, the magazine’s editors doubled down with another sardonic cartoon, captioned: “Italians, it is not Charlie Hebdo that built your homes, it’s the mafia!”The magazine published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2006, 2011 and 2012. The 2012 cartoon included a nude depiction that caused the most outrage in the Muslim world. At the time, White House spokesman Jay Carney questioned “the judgment” behind “publishing something like this.” The French government tried to persuade Charlie Hebdo from publishing; when that failed, it shut down embassies and schools in 20 countries for fear of reprisals.France’s then-foreign minister, Laurent Fabious, forcefully criticized the magazine, saying the “absurd” cartoons “awakened strong emotions in many Muslim countries” and asking whether it was “really sensible or intelligent to pour oil on the fire?”A policeman stands guard outside the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Feb. 9, 2006, after the publication reprinted cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and published one of its own on its front page.In 2011, Charlie Hebdo’s office was fire-bombed and its website hacked after it announced that Muhammad would be “editor-in-chief” of its next issue. The issue carried a cover drawing of the prophet making a sarcastic comment. The January 2015 terrorist attack put the magazine in the international spotlight, with the violent assassination of its 11 staffers garnering worldwide condemnation. But the magazine’s editorial choices have not had universal sympathy.In April 2015, six prominent Western writers withdrew as guest hosts from the annual gala of PEN America, an anti-censorship group that decided to give the magazine its annual Freedom of Expression Courage Award. The writers said they disagreed with the magazine’s promotion of “cultural intolerance.” One of them, Teju Cole, wrote in the New Yorker magazine that although Charlie Hebdo claimed to offend all parties, recently it had “gone specifically for racist and Islamophobic provocations.”In August 2017, Western politicians condemned Charlie Hebdo for publishing a cartoon critical of Islam on its front page after terrorist attacks in Spain killed 15 people and injured more than 100 others. Stephane Le Foll, a member of France’s parliament and former government minister, called the cartoon “extremely dangerous.” ""When you're a journalist you need to exercise restraint because making these associations can be used by other people,"" he said.PAKISTAN -- Supporters of hardline Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan carry placards and shout slogans during a protest against the reprinting of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad by French magazine Charlie Hebdo, in Rawalpindi, Sept. 4, 2020.Charlie Hebdo’s republication of the Prophet Muhammed cartoons prompted protests in Muslim countries beyond Iran. In Pakistan, thousands marched and burned French flags. Pakistan’s foreign ministry said on Twitter the move was “a deliberate act to offend the sentiments of billions of Muslims” and “cannot be justified as an exercise in press freedom or freedom of expression.”In a harsh condemnation, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hami Aksoy said the republication likewise dismissed a free speech rationale and complained of a “new generation of fascists and racists in France and Europe” acting to “increase anti-Islamism and xenophobia.”In an editorial explaining their decision, Charlie Hebdo’s editors wrote: “We have often been asked since January 2015 to print other caricatures of Muhammad. We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited – the law allows us to do so – but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate.”In the trial that began Sept. 9 in Paris, alleged accomplices in the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo’s office face various charges that include providing weapons and logistical support for the attacks, which terrorized the French capital for three days. Three defendants are being tried in absentia who are believed to have been killed in Syria while fighting for Islamic State.Twelve were gunned down in the attack on the magazine’s office, including 11 employees and a police officer; a female police officer was killed the following day; and four persons were killed at a kosher supermarket two days later. The three gunmen were killed in a police raid on Jan.9.";https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-cartoons-trial-france.html,https://www.france24.com/en/20200901-france-to-relive-charlie-hebdo-attacks-as-landmark-terror-trial-opens-in-paris-court,https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/09/10/Iranian-protesters-burn-US-Israeli-flags-in-Tehran-over-Charlie-Hebdo-cartoons,http://revealed-West-s-hostility-to-Islam,https://time.com/3657256/charlie-hebdo-paris-attack/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/france.pressandpublishing,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-causes-outrage-italy-earthquake-cartoon-depicting-dead-lasagne-a7223991.html,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/19/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-91912,https://nationalpost.com/news/magazines-nude-mohammad-cartoons-prompt-france-to-shut-embassies-schools-in-20-countries,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/europe/french-magazine-publishes-cartoons-mocking-muhammad.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35220633,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/nyregion/six-pen-members-decline-gala-after-award-for-charlie-hebdo.html?_r=0,https://www.newsweek.com/barcelona-attack-charlie-hebdo-publishes-controversial-front-cover-about-islam-653959,https://twitter.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1300834536914386944?s=20,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkey-slams-charlie-hebdo-for-anti-muslim-cartoons/1961102,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/01/charlie-hebdo-reprints-muhammad-cartoons-prophet-terror-trial,https://www.france24.com/en/20200908-charlie-hebdo-attack-survivor-recalls-horror-at-trial,https://webdoc.france24.com/france-paris-charlie-kosher-terrorism/;Iran’s Supreme Leader Spins Charlie Hebdo Case Into a Western Conspiracy;;;;;;
261;;;;False;Dmitry Peskov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-navalny-poisoning-disinfo/6742556.html;Russia Will Investigate Navalny’s Poisoning… As a Foreign Attempt to Destabilize the Country;2020-08-26;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On Tuesday, Aug. 25, President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov dismissed allegations that the Kremlin was complicit in the poisoning of leading opposition leader Alexey Navalny, calling them “empty noise.”""We do not understand why our German colleagues are in such a hurry to use the word 'poisoning' and so on,” Peskov said. “The substance must be found first, to understand what caused this condition. There must be grounds for investigation. For now, we are seeing a comatose patient.""That claim is false.There was no “hurry” in the German doctors “use of the word poisoning.” The Charite hospital in Berlin, to which Navalny was transported last Saturday, Aug. 22, from the Siberian city of Omsk, announced the first results of its examination of him on Monday, Aug. 24 – two days after he was admitted.Charite hospital said in a statement that “Navalny underwent extensive examination” and that “clinical findings indicate poisoning with a substance of cholinesterase inhibitors.” While the “specific substance involved remains unknown,” the German doctors indicated they had no doubts that Navalny was poisoned. “The effect of the poison… was confirmed by multiple tests in independent laboratories,” the hospital said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan are among the many foreign officials who have asked the Kremlin to launch an independent investigation into Navalny’s poisoning.Peskov said the Kremlin deemed such an investigation groundless because the exact “substance has not been found” and that the “patient is comatose.” He also said that the doctors in Germany had not said anything about Navalny that was different from what those who initially treated him in Omsk had said.However, unlike the doctors in Berlin, the doctors in Omsk have publicly denied that any of their testing found that Navalny was poisoned.In media reports, the suspicion that Navalny was poisoned was originally attributed to Navalny’s press secretary, Kira Yarmysh. Yarmysh was the first to tweet about Navalny being poisoned, but later said she was only repeating what emergency room doctors in the Omsk hospital told her.On Monday, Aug. 24, the Omsk hospital’s deputy head doctor, Anatoly Kalinichenko, confirmed Yarmysh’s information. “The emergency room doctors diagnosed him with toxic poisoning and that is why the patient was admitted to the toxicology unit,” he said. Kalinichenko added: “But the labs in Moscow and Omsk did not find any traces of toxic substances, so we’ve moved away from the poisoning diagnosis.”Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor of the Omsk hospital, complained during the same press conference that Navalny’s wife Yulya “never thanked” him or any other doctors for “saving her husband’s life.”RUSSIA -- Yulia Navalny, the wife of the Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny speaks to the press outside the Omsk Hospital .Navalny, the opposition leader and a long-time opponent of President Putin, was delivered to Murakhovsky’s care on Aug. 20 – after he fell ill on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Navalny’s relatives and supporters have criticized Murakhovsky. Oleg Navalny, the opposition leader’s younger brother, accused the doctor of endangering his brother’s life by resisting his evacuation to Germany, concealing test results and claiming that he had not been poisoned. Oleg Navalny accused Murakhovsky of acting on the orders of Russia’s security services.Murakhovsky told journalists on Aug. 21 that Navalny’s condition was due to a “metabolic disorder” and a “sudden drop” in blood sugar levels. The Omsk hospital chief doctor repeatedly denied that the opposition leader had been poisoned. Murakhovsky was echoed by several Russian state media reports claiming that the “metabolic disorder” was the result of Navalny’s “alcohol abuse.” A whole narrative about a “drunken night” on the outskirts of Tomsk was created. That story – just one of the many disinformation narratives that emerged in Russia as Navalny remains in a coma – has been debunked, including by the Tomsk resident in whose house, according to Russian media, Navalny “poisoned himself with samogon” (Russian moonshine).Moreover, according to a report in the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK.ru), during his trip to Tomsk, Navalny was under round-the-clock surveillance ordered from Moscow, “because even the feds did not know what his plans were.” MK.ru reported that two teams of plain clothes agents from two cities followed Navalny and his team, recording and documenting their every move. Citing a law enforcement source, the newspaper said that Navalny and his team did not purchase any alcohol.RUSSIA -- Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his brother Oleg take a selfie picture during a march in memory of murdered Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov in central Moscow on February 24, 2019.MK.ru also reported that they drove to one of his follower’s home village of Kaftanchikovo, some 12 miles outside of Tomsk, for Navalny to take a swim in the local river – his long time tradition when visiting new places.Murakhovsky claimed that the initial decision not to allow Navalny to be evacuated to Germany was because the doctors at Omsk hospital reached a consensus that he was “non-transportable.” He also claimed “none of our German colleagues objected” to that decision.But that was not what the German doctors said: they insisted, that Navalny was “fit to be airlifted and transported to Berlin.”The Omsk hospital’s refusal to release Navalny for transfer to Germany, as demanded by his family, delayed his evacuation for nearly 24 hours.Many social media users wrote that they believed Putin directly ordered that the Omsk doctors do not allow Navalny to be flown to Germany. These suspicions were reflected by Russians who hit the streets in Moscow and other cities, holding pieces of paper with “Putin, let Navalny go!” handwritten or printed on them. Arrests followed.Murakhovsky denied any political influence or pressure, as did Dmitry Peskov.Peskov promised the Kremlin would do everything it could to expedite Navalny’s transfer, if asked for help, and a day later claimed no one had made such a request. But Navalny’s wife Yulia published a copy of her request for such a transfer that she had addressed to Vladimir Putin and mailed to the Kremlin. She tweeted that she was “surprised to learn from the press, that it has not been received.”Navalny remains in a coma and his prognosis is unclear. The Charite hospital in Berlin said there is the “possibility of long-term effects, particularly those affecting the nervous system.”Meanwhile, a toxic disinformation campaign targeting Navalny is only accelerating in Russia, with top lawmakers, government agencies and celebrities joining the chorus.On Tuesday, Aug. 25, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of Russia’s parliament) ordered an investigation to determine whether the Navalny case is an attempt to destabilize Russia from abroad.";https://twitter.com/ChariteBerlin/status/1297906232251027458?s=20,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-kremlin/kremlin-defies-calls-to-probe-navalny-illness-says-poisoning-not-yet-certain-idUSKBN25L14Z,https://meduza.io/news/2020/08/25/kreml-ne-nashel-povoda-dlya-ugolovnogo-rassledovaniya-otravleniya-navalnogo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZuJ-xGeaIc&feature=youtu.be,https://twitter.com/Kira_Yarmysh/status/1297919021413740545?s=20,https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/776762-vrachi-navalnyi-omsk-lechenie-brifing,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/08/24/we-saved-navalnys-life-russian-doctors-say-a71226,https://ria.ru/20200824/navalnyy-1576220131.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/navalny-poisoning-fact-checkl/30794262.html,https://www.proekt.media/narrative/kreml-protiv-navalnogo/,https://www.mk.ru/incident/2020/08/21/otslezhen-ves-marshrut-navalnogo-pered-otravleniem-on-kupalsya.html,https://youtu.be/vZuJ-xGeaIc,https://www.dw.com/en/alexei-navalny-poisoning-omsk-berlin/a-54645234,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9256751,https://twitter.com/navalny/status/1296770523603574784?s=20,https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2020/08/25/837729-v-mid-nazvali-gluboko-oskorbitelnimi-obvineniya-po-delu-navalnogo?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://politros.com/176077-volodin-poruchil-profilnomu-komitetu-gd-proverit-incident-s-navalnym?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop;Russia Will Investigate Navalny’s Poisoning… As a Foreign Attempt to Destabilize the Country;;;;;;
262;;;;Misleading;Nicolás Maduro;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/maduro-continues-to-downplay-the-depth-of-venezuela-coronavirus-crisis/6742555.html;Maduro Again Downplays the Depths of Venezuela’s Coronavirus Crisis;2020-08-25;polygraph;Mariana Castro;"On August 18, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro tweeted a video of Norkis Obispo, a member of the pro-government political organization Frente Francisco de Miranda (FFM), talking about her experience being treated for COVID-19 at the Dr. Egor Nucete Hospital. In the video, Obispo says that she, in her role as an FFM member, has been involved in various activities to help the population deal with COVID-19, and that this is likely how she contracted the virus. She notes that she and other activists were getting COVID-19 tested weekly, and that she had tested positive for the virus five weeks earlier. Obispo discusses her experience at the hospital where she was treated, saying she received the necessary care, including daily vitamins and medication, along with four quality meals a day.Maduro accompanied the video with a message: ""The simple and heartfelt testimony of Norkis Obispo, a warrior from the [Venezuelan] Plains recovered from the Coronavirus, thanks to the treatments, care and care of all health personnel.” The video and the president’s message are misleading, and misrepresent how the coronavirus outbreak is impacting Venezuela. Just two days after Maduro’s tweet, members of the nursing staff at Dr. Egor Nucete Hospital launched a sit-down strike. They refused to further treat COVID-19 positive patients until they were guaranteed proper biosafety equipment and supplies, along with “decent and optimal working conditions” to treat patients without putting themselves at risk. ""We do not have biosecurity equipment, in addition to this there is no water or medical supplies or medical equipment to protect our lives. All these conditions violate the rules and laws [of the country],” they said, citing “deplorable conditions” at the hospital. Since the pandemic hit Venezuela, experts and international organizations have expressed concern over the effect it would have on its already-crippled healthcare system. As Polygraph.info reported in late June, Maduro has consistently downplayed the outbreak in Venezuela. Alianza Rebelde Investiga (ARI), a Venezuelan news media collaborative, reported on June 7 that ""hospital equipment, medical personnel and provision of basic services are insufficient” in the country’s 47 hospitals designated to treat coronavirus patients. Only 57 percent of the hospitals have a continuous water supply, and 43 percent have insufficient or no protective gear – such as gowns, surgical and face masks – for doctors and nurses. The investigation also found that only 15 ambulances were in operation for the entire hospital network. Venezuela has relied heavily on humanitarian aid from allies like Turkey and China, and international organizations like the United Nations, to acquire PPE and other medical resources. However, such aid has not been sufficient to counter the consequences of a crippled infrastructure, power outages and a scarce water supply. In the video, Obispo urges people to get tested if they have coronavirus symptoms, but widespread and reliable testing is also an issue in Venezuela.Rafael Orihuela, a former Venezuelan minister of health, told the Voice of America that there are not enough labs for COVID-19 testing, even though more could be built (and were promised). “It seems that there is an attempt not to do so in order to keep [the figures] murky,” he said. “Currently, we have only one that is in Caracas where the test is done and it takes three weeks to deliver the results.” CARACAS – People wearing face masks walk along Sabana Grande Boulevard after the government intensify a nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, in Caracas, on July 15, 2020. Federico PARRA / AFP During the last week, international media have reported on how Venezuela’s government is handling the pandemic, including deploying security forces and putting those who test positive in warehouses with sub-minimal living conditions. The New York Times reported on Aug. 19 that Venezuelans who are returning to their country because of the pandemic – denounced as “bioterrorists"" by Maduro – are being put into crowded rooms with limited protection, food and water, and ""held under military guard for weeks or months for coronavirus tests or treatment with unproven medications.” In cities like Maracaibo, the capital of Zulia state, police patrol streets looking for Venezuelans who returned home without official approval, the Times reported. In early June, 20 people infected with the virus asked to be released from the University Hospital of Maracaibo because they had no food or water. The state's doctors’ association has decried a lack of hospital beds and supplies, use of low-budget hotels to quarantine coronavirus patients and the limited use of face masks. Bloomberg reported on August 24 that patients and doctors are avoiding being tested so as not to be sent to state-run quarantine centers. “Venezuela was already very short on medical staff. People are afraid. Now patients arrive immediately needing intensive care because they lived with the disease at home until they just couldn’t any longer,” Maria Graciela Lopez, head of Venezuela’s Society of Infectology, told the news agency. Some people are relying on the black market for tests, so they are not monitored by the government. On June 1, Maduro’s government and the opposition-led National Assembly, along with the Pan American Health Associations (PAHO), signed an agreement committing to work together to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. They also committed to create official channels for PAHO to help in fight the pandemic in Venezuela, by delivering assistance aimed at increasing diagnostic capacity, protecting health workers, responding to confirmed cases, increasing epidemiological surveillance and improving risk communication with the population. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, as of August 23, Venezuela had recorded a total of 39,564 COVID-19 cases and 329 deaths.

263;;;;False;Felipe Neto;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/with-a-fake-tweet-smear-campaign-targets-bolsonaro-critic/6742525.html;With a Fake Tweet, Smear Campaign Targets Bolsonaro Critic;2020-08-05;polygraph;Mariana Castro;"Over the past week, Brazilians social media users have been furiously attacking Felipe Neto, one of the country’s most famous YouTube producers. Neto’s videos attract a massive young audience on the site, with 39 million followers. The false attacks smear Neto by suggesting he’s an apologist for pedophilia. The claim is unsupported, and Neto has strenuously denied the accusations and condemned them as politically motivated, as have his supporters. Journalists, celebrities and politicians used the hashtag #TogetherWithFelipeNeto (#JuntosComFelipeNeto in Portuguese) to express solidarity, including famous Brazilian TV host Luciano Hulk and Gabriela Prioli, political commentator for CNN Brasil.    One post with defamatory innuendo has been widely shared on social media: It shows a screenshot of a supposed May 31 tweet from Neto saying “[a] child is like candy, I eat hidden.”   The tweet is fake.Neto has been attacked by President Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters and allies for the past three years for his political views. The latest campaign began in mid-July after Neto published a video with The New York Times, titled “Trump Isn’t the Worst Pandemic President.”  In the video, Neto condemned Bolsonaro’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, stating that Bolsonaro is the “worst COVID president in the world.” Polygraph.info has published recent fact checks about the COVID-19 problem in Brazil, the country with the second-highest cases and deaths after the U.S. Both Bolsonaro and Trump have staunchly defended their responses to the pandemic.The fake Neto tweet has been debunked by Brazilian media organizations. (The same message was found to have been used in a meme against Pope Francis and the Catholic Church.) The tweet cannot be found on Neto’s Twitter page. The only tweet by Neto in which he used the word “criança” – Portuguese for child – was posted on May 30, in which he discussed the movie “Faroeste Caboclo,” a Brazilian drama from 2013 inspired by the homonymous song by the band Legião Urbana.Neto responded on Twitter, calling the fake tweet “a disgusting lie, which shows how far they are able to go to try to ruin the reputation of opponents.” But at that point, the attacks against him had expanded. The hashtag #AllAgainstFelipeNeto (in Portuguese #TodosContraFelipeNeto) was trending on Twitter and was shared by the former Education Minister, Abraham Weintraub, that same day. “The safety of your family's children depends on you. #TodosContraFelipeNeto…Don’t leave the Big Bad Wolf with your kids. Use the MEC material made by the teacher @CarlosNadalim,” said the post, which also was retweeted by Eduardo Bolsonaro, one of the president’s sons.Two days later, on July 29, a group of Bolsonaro’s supporters showed up outside of Neto’s house with a car outfitted with speakers to intimidate him, according to media reports. Among them was Leandro Cavalieri, who threatened Neto and accused him of destroying the “most important institution of all, which is the family."" Cavalieri – known on social media as “Bolsonaro’s warrior” – was later identified as one of those involved in setting off fireworks at the Supreme Court in the capital, Brasília, in mid-June, the Globo newspaper reported. That incident reflected dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court and Congress among many in Bolsonaro’s base who believed the institutions were blocking the president. On July 30, Neto participated in a live video on YouTube with Supreme Court Justice Luís Roberto Barroso to discuss politics, youth and fake news.The event was flooded by opponents whose critical comments and dislikes appeared in volumes disproportionate to the actual number of viewers. Neto later blamed bots and organized groups. On August 3, Pedro Bruzzi, a partner in the company Arquimede, which analyzes social media, spoke to Globo about how the attacks against Neto played out. He said that between July 22 and July 28, there were 1.2 million mentions of Neto on social media – 49 percent of them attacking him. The hashtag #AllAgainstFelipeNeto garnered 400 thousand mentions. Bruzzi said that the use of the same arguments and hashtag suggested orchestration.Neto has been on YouTube for more than 10 years. He started a channel to talk about gossip and entertainment in a comical way. More recently, the focus is on entertainment and gaming, and the channel is particularly popular with children.On Twitter, Neto has 12 million followers. His involvement in politics intensified after 2018, when he rose as an opposition voice to Bolsonaro and far-right politicians. In May, he appeared on the prominent Brazilian talk show Roda Viva, which he said marked a turning point for organized attacks against him.The same month, social media platforms took down another screenshot of a fake tweet attributed to Neto and falsely tying him to pedophilia The fabricated tweet was fact-checked and debunked by Brazilian news outlets.";https://twitter.com/senadorhumberto/status/1287821180125184000,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/opinion/coronavirus-covid-brazil-bolsonaro.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/bolsonaro-top-health-official-flubs-a-key-virus-fact/30751052.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/bolsonaro-son-counters-coronavirus/30714771.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-latin-america-covid19-cases/30678417.html,https://g1.globo.com/fato-ou-fake/noticia/2020/07/28/e-fake-que-felipe-neto-fez-post-pedofilo-no-twitter-associando-criancas-a-doces.ghtml,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/07/27/verificamos-felipe-neto-violencia-sexual/,https://twitter.com/search?q=crian%C3%A7a%20(from%3Afelipeneto)%20until%3A2020-06-01%20since%3A2020-05-30&src=typed_query,https://twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1287792920997834752,https://twitter.com/AbrahamWeint/status/1287881399718928384 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6577QBSdI4,https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/autor-de-ameacas-na-casa-de-felipe-neto-estava-no-grupo-que-jogou-fogos-de-artificio-no-stf-24559889,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mT2OpPnuOQ,https://twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1288911550263316481,https://oglobo.globo.com/podcast/como-foi-articulado-ataque-felipe-neto-nas-redes-sociais-24563694,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ1CQqNveac,https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2020/08/02/exclusivo-detalhes-ineditos-da-investigacao-do-facebook-que-derrubou-perfis-bolsonaristas.ghtml,https://www.twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1265329948249784321,http://twitter.com/felipeneto/status/1265329948249784321;With a Fake Tweet, Smear Campaign Targets Bolsonaro Critic;;;;;;

Often It Goes a Little Too Far;2020-07-31;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On July 29, Iran's Mehr news agency carried a statement by Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force leader. Mehr is a Tehran-based multilingual news agency owned and operated by the Islamic Ideology Dissemination organization, which observers describe as the government’s “propaganda arm.” Hajizadeh’s statement came on the second day of an Iranian military drill in the Strait of Hormuz and in the broader Persian Gulf region. One target in the drill was a mockup of a U.S. military ship – a replica of the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers the U.S. Navy routinely sails in the Persian Gulf waters.Iranian news agencies reported that the drills ""simulated a real warzone engagement” and were “meant to send across a message of warning to those potentially seeking to undermine the country’s security.”Nour-1, Iran’s first military satellite, which was launched in April, monitored the wargames and simultaneously transmitted “high resolution” images of the U.S.-operated al-Udeid Airbase in Qatar, the Iranian news agencies reported.Iranian state TV channels broadcast live video of the exercise, followed by footage of the destruction of the mockup vessel in their hourly news programs and special features.According to Mehr, General Hajizadeh said the drills demonstrated the IRGC’s extensive capabilities, including the launch of missiles:""During the Payambar-e Azam 14 (The Great Prophet) war games in south Iran, IRGC successfully launched underground ballistic missiles for the first time in the world.""That claim is false.It may be a first-time success for Iran, but the world has been launching missiles from the underground platforms called “silos” for decades. Nazi Germany built the first underground missile-launching hubs around 1943. The Nazis constructed silos in occupied France and the Baltics, using the latter as a test site for long-range missiles (V-2, A-4) which, at the time, were top secret. By the beginning of 1944, U.S. intelligence had identified and bombed 96 Nazi silos, preventing them from becoming operational.FRANCE -- Among the wreckage of St. Lo, France, on July 31, 1944, now being cleared by U.S. engineers, is the tower of Notre Dame Cathedral almost isolated. Shattered buildings are seen all around - evidence of the fierce fighting between American and Nazi forces.After World War II, the U.S. military adopted the technology for intercontinental nuclear missiles, building hundreds of silos across the country during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and other countries followed suit.According to the Arms Control Association, 31 countries have ballistic missiles, and few still launch them from the underground hubs. The U.S. considers launching silos “vulnerable” and the technology “outdated.” It now focuses on mobile launch technologies.Many of the U.S. missile silos have been decommissioned. Some have been purchased by private citizens and turned into houses or safe bunkers. Following the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the market for silos heated up.Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are considered especially dangerous as weapons of mass destruction because of their ability to carry nuclear, biological or chemical warheads. They are relatively precise and fast, and some are capable of hypersonic speeds.U.S. -- The Titan Missile, shown from above during a tour of the 103-foot Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) site which was decommissioned in 1982, at the Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Arizona, February 2, 2019.During Iran’s latest exercises, U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia and Qatar were briefly put on high alert after detecting the missile launches in Iran, the Pentagon said.Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokesperson for the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, called Iran’s behavior “irresponsible and reckless.” Still, she said the drills have “not disrupted coalition operations in the area nor had any impacts to the free flow of commerce in the Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters.”The U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet has been deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), a multinational effort, currently led by the U.K., to safeguard maritime traffic in the region.In November 2019, the U.S. launched Operation Sentinel “to increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation in light of recent events in the Arabian Gulf region.”Based in Bahrain, Operation Sentinel includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Australia and the United Kingdom.For decades, Iran has opposed any Western naval presence in the Persian Gulf, but Tehran’s actions have seldom crossed the threshold of verbal threats and occasional harassment of the U.S. vessels. Experts say “extreme escalation” in the Gulf would be a “double-edged sword” for Iran, cutting it off from its main supply routes. The New York Times reported on July 18 that Iran and China had forged a wide-ranging economic and security partnership, under which Beijing will invest billions of dollars in Iran’s energy and other sectors.The agreement with China is a “game changer” for Iran, Elisa Catalano Ewers and Ariana Tabatabai wrote in the War on the Rocks blog.The deal “would allow Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz without losing its ability to export oil and forfeiting corresponding revenues. It would also allow Iran to sustain energy supplies to China, thus avoiding the political backlash that might come from taking more offensive actions in the Strait of Hormuz,” they wrote.";https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2019/09/25/iran-trying-to-expand-influence-into-kashmir/,https://youtu.be/UuxWvc7RjV4,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/07/29/630696/Iran-IRGC-wargame-drills-Persian-Gulf-warning-message-enemies,https://youtu.be/peycBNdOzbo,http://www.allworldwars.com/V-Weapons%20Crossbow%20Campaign.html,http://www.allworldwars.com/V-Weapons%20Crossbow%20Campaign.html#10,https://www.nps.gov/articles/minuteman-missiles-on-the-great-plains.htm,https://www.dw.com/en/intercontinental-ballistic-missiles-and-their-long-shared-history-with-sputnik-1/a-39658661,https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/missiles,https://fas.org/nuke/intro/missile/icbm.htm,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/how-a-missile-silo-became-the-most-difficult-interior-decorating-job-ever-73593480/,https://www.army-technology.com/features/feature-the-10-longest-range-intercontinental-ballistic-missiles-icbm/,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/07/29/in-latest-message-to-us-iran-launches-underground-ballistic-missiles-during-exercise-targeting-mock-carrier/,https://news.usni.org/2020/01/30/u-k-royal-navy-takes-lead-in-persian-gulf-shipping-protection-mission,https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/1911282/us-central-command-statement-on-operation-sentinel/,https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2020/03/16/allies-shoulder-for-influence-in-the-gulf-region-as-naval-security-remains-top-priority/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/world/asia/china-iran-trade-military-deal.html,https://warontherocks.com/2020/07/how-irans-oil-infrastructure-gambit-could-imperil-the-strait-of-hormuz/;Iran’s Military Bragging is Classic.

265;;;;False;Aleksandr Lukashenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/belarus-lukashenko-fact-check/6742514.html;‘Landlord’ of Belarus Smites the Press and Women in Politics;2020-07-29;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On July 23, Aleksandr Lukashenko, president of Belarus, expressed frustration with the way officials in his administration and government ministries have been handling hard-hitting media coverage of opposition protests in the country since May. Lukashenko said his administration, press secretary and ministries have been doing nothing to stop the “dirt-spitting” press. “We are the landlords of this country! So do your duties, if you can’t just say so, others will do the job!” he said in a video meeting with the officials. Lukashenko then scolded Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, who stood and listened with his head down. “In the foreign ministry everybody just sits and waits for the president’s orders! Why do you tolerate them? You’ve accredited them here, so don’t wait for an end of the election campaign, expel them!” Lukashenko said.That was after claiming the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) “go beyond biased reporting” and “call for mass riots.”That claim is false.In their extensive coverage of the protests and upcoming presidential election in Belarus, neither the BBC nor RFE/RL has “called for mass riots.”Ad Fontes Media, an independent group that monitors media bias, rated BBC “neutral/balanced” in terms of bias and “most reliable” in terms of trustworthiness.The Media Bias/Fact Check website, a partner in the Poynter Institute’s global fact-checking network, rated RFE/RL as “least biased” in terms of using “neutral language” and “balance of coverage.” The website rated RFE/RL’s reporting as mostly factual, though at times tilting pro-USA.Lukashenko, 65, a former communist and political officer in the Soviet army, has been ruling Belarus since 1994, when the office of president was established after the country regained its independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.Lukashenko’s popularity has diminished over the last several years as the country struggled with economic stagnation and low wages. In May, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to protest his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said could not cause harm if people drank vodka every day and took a sauna more often.Then, on Tuesday, July 28, Lukashenko announced that he was an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier. “Ninety-seven percent of Belarusians who contract the virus will recover without showing any symptoms,” he said.According to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, Belarus had 67,366 confirmed COVID-19 infections and 543 reported deaths as of the day Lukashenko revealed his infection.Experts the tally puts Belarus is among the worst counties in eastern Europe in terms of its government’s response to coronavirus.The “coronavirus protests” that started in the capital Minsk in May, became known as the “slipper revolution” after a leading opponent referred to Lukashenko as a “cockroach” and called on voters to “squash the pest” in the Aug. 9 presidential election. Author Daniel Kalder, who has written books about the literature of dictators, describes the genesis of the revolution in a recent analysis published by the online magazine UnHerd.""[T]he dam seems to have burst when a popular YouTuber, Sergei Tikhanovsky, cracked a gag about Lukashenko’s moustache, comparing it to a cockroach, and then took to driving around in a van with a giant slipper — the most popular form of pest control in the country — on it. All of a sudden, protestors took to the streets of Minsk with slippers in hand and foreign analysts were talking up a potential “slipper revolution.""Lukashenko has said he personally ordered Tikhanosvsky’s arrest. In mid-June, he also accused his leading rival, Viktor Babariko, of corruption. Reuters reported that the accusation came the day after local offices of Russia’s Gazprombank, headed by Babariko, were raided in a tax evasion case. Babariko, who gathered 400,000 signatures for his candidacy, was jailed.A third candidate, former ambassador to the United States Valery Tsepkalo was disqualified after officials rejected most of the 160,000 signatures his campaign collected, a ruling Tsepkalo said was political. He has since fled to Moscow with his children.With his male political rivals barred from registering as candidates and/or arrested, Lukashenko now faces an unexpected challenge: an all-female trio representing the united opposition. The front-runner is Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, the wife of the jailed blogger and mother of two, who first stepped in as a placeholder for her husband. Also, in the group is Tsepkalo’s wife, Veronika.Lukashenko’s reaction? Sexist and patronizing.On May 29, during a meeting with the workers at the Minsk tractor factory, a man asked Lukashenko his opinion about political opponents. Lukashenko mentioned “these men who do nothing but brag on the Internet,” then, turned to the women candidates.“Nobody will vote for a woman. The Belarusian society is not mature enough to vote for a woman. Our constitution is not fit for a woman because it gives the president a lot of power. The president will be a guy, I am absolutely sure of it.”Anger over Lukashenko’s comments was the reason they “turned into politics,” Belarusian women interviewed by BBC explained. Many joined opposition protests for the first time because the president’s sexism reflected the overall marginalization of women in society, and that needs to change, they said.On June 20, when speaking at the WWII memorial in the city of Mogilev, Lukashenko’s attempt at damage control backfired. “There are attempts now to push me against the women. Remember, I said once that in Belarus a woman can’t become a president yet,” he complained to the crowd. “What I meant was that our Constitution is such that even for a tough guy it is hard to carry its burden. If you load that on a woman, she will collapse, poor thing. That’s what I meant, not because I don’t respect women.”Tikhanovskaya, described initially as a “reluctant candidate,” has since spoken to crowds of thousands, delivered a TV address and received endorsements from across the political spectrum, becoming Lukashenko’s main challenger. According to the Guardian newspaper, it was her interview with the BBC that caused Lukashenko’s anti-media outburst.“We have a dictator as a head of our country. You can’t say anything, do anything, everything is forbidden,” Thikhanovskaya told BBC in a July 22 interview. She was “afraid” because the state “can do anything” to her, she said, even take her children away and place them in an orphanage. Asked whether she believed if she can win the presidential bid, Tikhanovskaya said, “We don’t believe in honest elections. But I still believe that our president will understand, that his time is over. People don’t want him anymore.”Minsk, Belarus - Participants ride bicycles during a protest flash mob.None of the past five presidential elections in Belarus has been rated free and fair. International observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe accused Lukashenko of abusing administrative powers to forge the votes and secure his victory.Observers are skeptical the Aug. 9 vote will be any different, with Lukashenko holding a “monopoly on violence and control of the ballot box,” Markos Kounalakis, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in an analysis of the situation.The constitution of Belarus sets one presidential term at five years. Initially, it included a two-term limit for the same person to serve as president. That was lifted in 1996.";https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=belarus,https://www.rferl.org/s?k=belarus&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/,https://apnews.com/AlexanderLukashenko,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/08/belarus-lukashenko-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-containment-economy-russia/,https://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-recovers-from-asymptomatic-coronavirus-infection-132075-2020/,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2020/06/how-poor-handling-covid-19-has-caused-uproar-belarus,https://www.voanews.com/europe/slipper-revolution-shakes-belarus,https://unherd.com/2020/07/why-europes-last-dictator-has-survived/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-opposition-election/2020/07/23/86f231f6-c5ca-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election/belarus-president-accuses-election-rival-of-corruption-after-raid-idUSKBN23J2R1,https://apnews.com/8bd00ebaf8d41845996bae512148babb,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election/hundreds-protest-in-belarus-after-two-main-challengers-barred-from-election-ballot-idUSKCN24F10W,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election-opposition/dismissed-as-poor-things-three-women-try-to-unseat-male-president-of-belarus-idUSKCN24N1PT,https://www.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-otvetil-na-vopros-o-svoih-vozmozhnyh-simpatijah-k-potentsialnym-kandidatam-na-vyborah-392809-2020/,http://president.gov.by/ru/news_ru/view/otkrytie-memorialnogo-kompleksa-pamjati-sozhzhennyx-dereven-mogilevskoj-oblasti-23855/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/belarus-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-unseat-alexander-lukashenko,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-53491514/belarus-election-snatched-from-the-streets-in-europe-s-last-dictatorship,https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/8/191586.pdf,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/opinion/article244446567.html;‘Landlord’ of Belarus Smites the Press and Women in Politics;;;;;;

Pazuello’s comment came as he responded to a question about his ministry’s proposals to reopen some areas of the country.“You have to have screenings everywhere. If the [governor or mayor] decides to open an essential or production area,” he said, “there has to be a screening structure and medical monitoring of initial symptoms."" That strategy is accepted by most medical experts. But then Pazuello added:“If the case is asymptomatic, [the employee] is working, but also doesn’t transmit [the virus]. If the case is symptomatic, he has to appear [at a testing center].""  The claim that asymptomatic people do not spread the virus is false.To be sure, the notion of asymptomatic spread has been the subject of debate and intensive research. The issue rose in prominence on June 8, when a World Health Organization official suggested that such silent transmission was “very rare” and that asymptomatic patients were not driving virus spread.The WHO walked it back the next day: “I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that that’s [a] misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on the coronavirus pandemic, during a question-and-answer session.She added that while the WHO couldn’t say how much virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers, it certainly happens.That same day, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, citing the WHO, asserted that the “the transmission through asymptomatic [people] is practically zero.” He suggested it could “signal to a faster opening of commerce and the extinction of those restrictive measures” that had closed stores and prohibited public gatherings. He did add, however, that “nothing is proven in the coronavirus issue.”Asked about the issue on June 11, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC’s Good Morning America: ""We know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms.” Evidence for silent spread As the pandemic enters its fifth official month, numerous studies have found that symptomless transmission is spreading the virus. The Washington Post reported on July 18 that studies trying to pinpoint the “patients zero” in outbreaks show commonalities among the likely sources – one being people who are infected but asymptomatic. A recent study from China, which sampled the body surfaces of 13 COVID-19 patients (including two asymptomatic ones), revealed that asymptomatic people can contaminate their surroundings.Another study by scientists at Italy’s University of Padova and Imperial College London, released on June 30, found that more than 40 percent of positive cases in Vò, a northern Italian town, showed no symptoms.Confusing the matter is the distinction drawn between “asymptomatic” and “presymptomatic” cases.Asymptomatic cases are those in which individuals test positive for coronavirus but never develop symptoms. But some of those who test positive while not showing symptoms develop them later. These cases are classified as presymptomatic.Researchers have shown that individuals can spread the virus before developing symptoms – and may actually be most contagious during that time. It is possible that patients who are asymptomatic turn out to be presymptomatic and highly infectious.The risk from such silent spread explains the importance of widespread testing – so that these a- or pre- symptomatic cases can be discovered early and quarantined.A study by Chinese researchers, published in mid-April by the journal Nature Medicine, found that viral spreading began 2 to 3 days before the appearance of symptoms. By July, U.S. and Canadian researchers suggested that more than half of infections could be attributed to asymptomatic and presymptomatic “silent transmission.”Also in July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighed in with an assessment based on multiple studies.“[I]n the aggregate, these diverse studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by persons with presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, which may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the CDC concluded.

Pazuello’s July 23 statements followed a record of mixed signals from Bolsonaro’s government, which critics say ignored health warnings while pushing to reopen the economy quickly.Brazil’s Estado de São Paulo newspaper reported on July 22 that Pazuello had been alerted in May by a Health Ministry technical committee that, without isolation measures, it could take up to two years to control the pandemic. The minister nonetheless continued to push for reopening. In June, Pazuello’s administration temporarily stopped publishing overall data on Covid-19 cases and deaths. Pazuello later said the change was only a proposal.Bolsonaro himself has consistently minimized the dangers of COVID-19, initially describing it as a “small cold” and calling the alarm over the pandemic “hysterical.”Then, on July 7, Bolsonaro said he tested positive for coronavirus and was taking the hydroxychloroquine – the controversial anti-malaria drug that hasn’t been proved effective on the virus. Two weeks later, Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus a third time.On July 25, however, Bolsonaro said he’d tested negative and released a photo of himself with a box of hydroxychloroquine. Pazuello, an army general who specializes in logistics, has no experience in health care. Since the outbreak, two Bolsonaro health ministers left their posts amid disagreements with him about isolation measures and the use of hydroxychloroquine.";https://www.facebook.com/minsaude/videos/205254654239814/?v=205254654239814,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RcJ2yyNkUk,https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/06/09/bolsonaro-cita-declaracao-da-oms-sobre-transmissao-por-assintomaticos-cientistas-alertam-que-estudo-e-limitado.ghtml,https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-10-20-intl/h_3cd73ecd8ce1910f69541e91534e39bc,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/18/coronavirus-superspreading-events-drive-pandemic/,https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/3/e00442-20,http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2488-1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/02/2008373117,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-1595_article?deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM27448,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,ministro-da-saude-foi-avisado-de-que-efeitos-da-covid-19-durariam-ate-2-anos,70003373144,https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/06/09/pazuelo-diz-que-divulgacao-de-mortes-por-covid-19-por-data-e-nao-dia-do-registro-e-proposta-maia-cobra-transparencia.ghtml,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbBvuXlNWjE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbBvuXlNWjE,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-brazil-bolsonaro-tests-positive/2020/07/07/5fa71548-c049-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html,https://valor.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/07/22/bolsonaro-testa-positivo-para-covid-19-pela-terceira-vez-e-seguir-em-isolamento.ghtml,https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1286994557440348160 ,https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/A-Paratrooper-General-Is-Brazils-New-Health-Minister-20200516-0004.html;Bolsonaro’s Top Health Official Flubs a Key Virus Fact;;;;;;

The revelation came after two straight months of steep increases in coronavirus cases in Brazil, where Bolsonaro has downplayed the risks and lashed out at health officials and other critics. Brazil trails only the United States in reported COVID-19 cases at nearly 1.7 million and is second with deaths at 67,000, according to statistics as of the day after Bolsonaro’s announcement about his health. Bolsonaro said he was tested for the virus after having a fever but felt “very well” and was taking hydroxychloroquine, a controversial anti-malaria drug with no scientific proof of being effective against COVID-19. Some of his aides previously tested positive, and Bolsonaro’s efforts to minimize the pandemic – including flouting masks – have been widely criticized. On June 27, Carlos Bolsonaro, a city council member in Rio de Janeiro and one of President Bolsonaro's sons, accused journalists and political opponents of misrepresenting the country’s effort against the coronavirus pandemic.On Twitter, the younger Bolsonaro wrote: ""You won't see this type of information in most TV stations … and even less in the posts of the ‘journalists’ of the affiliates of those who always raped the country."" The tweet was followed by a video with statistics chosen to demonstrate the country’s fiscal output for fighting the virus and bolstering the economy. Bolsonaro’s tweet and video are misleading. Pandemic spending The first slide of the video, produced by the presidential communications department (known as Secom), purports to show Brazil’s investment in fighting the pandemic as a percentage of its economy (as measured by gross domestic product, or GDP). Brazil made ""one of the biggest volumes of investment against the pandemic in the entire world:” 5.8 percent of GDP, compared to an average 4.5 percent in developed countries, the slide says. The date of that estimate is unclear. According to a government publication in May, however, the numbers were different. Announced pandemic measures amounted to only 4.8 percent of GDP, while the average of developed countries was 4.3 percent. Moreover, not all this money has been spent. A budget breakdown from a congressional budget office shows that, as of July 6, the federal government announced pandemic fiscal measures amounting to $94 billion. From that, about 42 percent had been used and $58 billion reserved. That includes the universe of pandemic spending categories, such as unemployment and aid to businesses, states, cities and for public health.According to the COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Index, which tracked the pandemic responses of 168 countries, Brazil ranked 22nd in overall fiscal commitments. (The ranking is based on International Monetary Fund data through late June and early July.) Where the money goes Columbia University economist Ceyhun Elgin, who co-authored a paper on the index, said one problem with making comparisons is that “size is not everything, unfortunately.” Elgin said it’s expected that countries hit the hardest will spend more. As important is how the money is used. “For example, if in a country most of the package is just going [for] cheap credit or low-interest credit to businesses, it is not helping the labor market much,” he said.Brazil allocated most of its pandemic resources to emergency assistance money, followed by credit lines for small and medium-sized companies – an amount greater than federal assistance to states and municipalities.Ranked on a per capita basis, Elgin said Brazil’s overall commitment drops to around 50th place.The country’s economy remains imperiled. Nearly 12 million Brazilians were unemployed in the second week of June, a five-week high, according to the latest government survey. News reports said many who went to the bank to get assistance said their money wasn’t available, and some payments went out to dead people.Artists hold a banner reading ""Who's gone is someone's love, 30,000 dead"" amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Brasilia Rising virus cases Nor does the coronavirus outbreak show any sign of slowing; both cases and deaths have been climbing steeply since May, according to Johns Hopkins data. President Bolsonaro’s critics say lack of a coordinated national response gave states unprecedented autonomy but allowed the crisis to drag on. As in the United States, where the virus is resurgent, some Brazilian states lifted lockdowns early.Cases are also underreported thanks to limited testing. According to John Hopkins, Brazil has performed an average of 32 daily tests per 100,000. That compares with 63 in the U.S. The BBC reported that a study by the Health Intelligence Laboratory of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School said a more accurate estimate of COVID-19 cases is close to 9 million. The inability to keep a health minister has affected the country's response. President Bolsonaro fired his first minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, because of disagreements over quarantine orders. The second minister, Nelson Teich, resigned partly due to the president's push to mass produce hydroxychloroquine (the anti-malaria drug that hasn't been proven effective to prevent COVID-19).The country has gone nearly two months without an official minister. Mortality data The second slide of Carlos Bolsonaro’s video shows Brazil ranking 18th among countries with 214 deaths per million – based on data sourced from the country’s Health Ministry and the tracking site Worldometers. Timing of that estimate is unclear.As of July 8, the tracking site Our World in Data shows Brazil with 314 deaths per million people, and Worldmeters shows 316. BRAZIL -- A woman wearing a face mask and shield to protect from the spread of the new coronavirus, takes part in a protest against racism and police violence during a ""Black Lives Matter"" demonstration in Duque de Caxias, Brazil, Wednesday, June 10, 2020 The final slide in the video ranks Brazil as second in recovered cases. Since Brazil has the second-most reported case, that doesn’t necessarily signal special success at managing the outbreak. The United States, with the most confirmed cases, also has the most recovered cases. Slander investigation Carlos Bolsonaro has been at the center of an investigation opened by the president of Brazil’s Supreme Court, Dias Toffoli, in March 2019 into the use of false information to threaten and slander Supreme Court justices. On April of this year, Folha de SP reported that the federal police identified him as an organizer of the scheme. Carlos dismissed the claims on his Twitter as a ""joke"" and said it was media manipulation.";https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus.html ,https://twitter.com/CarlosBolsonaro/status/1276937006510215168 ,https://www.gov.br/economia/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2020/maio/brasil-investe-mais-que-a-media-dos-paises-avancados-no-combate-ao-coronavirus,https://www2.camara.leg.br/ig-orcamento/ ,http://web.boun.edu.tr/elgin/COVID.htm ,https://voxeu.org/article/economic-policy-responses-pandemic-covid-19-economic-stimulus-index,https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/07/03/cerca-de-11-milhao-de-pessoas-voltaram-ao-trabalho-no-pais-na-segunda-semana-de-junho-diz-ibge.ghtml ,https://g1.globo.com/ba/bahia/noticia/2020/07/02/auxilio-emergencial-foi-pago-a-mais-de-1300-mortos-na-bahia-irregularidades-geram-prejuizo-de-r-26-milhoes-aponta-tcu.ghtml ,https://g1.globo.com/go/goias/noticia/2020/06/13/fraudes-e-usuario-dado-como-morto-sao-alguns-dos-problemas-enfrentados-na-busca-pelo-auxilio-emergencial-em-goias.ghtml,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-brazils-uncoordinated-approach-to-covid-19-gave-the-country-the-second-highest-death-toll-in-the-world-2020-06-18 ,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/international-comparison,https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-53287455 ,https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-covid-deaths-per-million ,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdUOA? ,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/entenda-o-inquerito-do-supremo-contra-fake-news-e-conheca-os-pontos-polemicos.shtml ,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2020/04/federal-police-names-carlos-bolsonaro-as-organizer-of-fake-news-criminal-scheme.shtml,https://twitter.com/carlosbolsonaro/status/1254158645505515520?lang=en ;Bolsonaro’s Son Counters Coronavirus Attacks with Spin-tistics;;;;;;

In the latest (2019) Global Health Security Index study of 195 countries, Venezuela’s health care capacity ranked 146th.""The coronavirus COVID-19 has forced [the government] to decree an ‘state of alarm' with mandatory closures, which indicates a paralysis of the productive, educational and recreational sectors, in a country with accumulated inflation of 740.9% since January 1 until May 31, 2020,"" said Maryorin Mendez, a Venezuelan journalist for NTN24 news channel. (Editor’s note: Estimates of inflation in Venezuela can vary greatly.)In mid-March, Maduro first ordered a nationwide lockdown, with which many Venezuelans realistically couldn't comply. Among other things, they needed access to basics, like clean water and food markets.He later introduced a new intermittent system (known as Sistema 7-7), under which restrictions alternate every seven days. ""'Seven days of work plus seven days of quarantine,"" as the country's executive vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, announced. But critics said the system, similar to one developed in Israel, might not work under Venezuela’s conditions. And COVID-19 cases continued to climb.Venezuela has reported 4,365 positive COVID-19 cases and 38 deaths as of June 25. But these numbers are highly disputed. Early in the pandemic, Maduro claimed to have carried out 1 million coronavirus tests when the United Nations put the number at only about 1,800.In a study released on May 8, the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences concluded that ""the tests carried out so far in Venezuela are insufficient to adequately estimate the true size of the COVID-19 epidemic in Venezuela."" It also concluded that ""underreporting is estimated to be 63% at best and at worst 95% of symptomatic cases as of April 23, 2020.""Following the study's publication, the head of the pro-government Constituent National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, dismissed the study and ordered an investigation into it. The academy said on Twitter that it was being threatened for ""doing [its] work.""Doctors Carlos Martinez and Maria Martinez wait in line to get fuel at a gas station, during a nationwide quarantine due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Caracas, Venezuela April 7, 2020.Maracaibo was once an oil boom town but is now struck by a gasoline shortage and regular blackouts. The Zulia state doctors’ association has decried a lack of hospital beds and supplies, use of low-budget hotels to quarantine coronavirus patients and the limited use of face masks.According to the Alianza Rebelde Investiga (ARI), a Venezuelan news media collaborative, a government survey of the country's 47 hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 patients shows ""both hospital equipment, medical personnel and provision of basic services are insufficient.""ARI’s investigation, published June 7, found that the number of available treatment beds, according to communications minister Jorge Rodríguez, did not match the number in a report by the country's Ministry of Health. In March, Rodríguez said there were 23,762 beds for COVID-19 patients – counting public hospitals, private clinics, diagnostic centers, (part of Venezuela's social welfare program, Mission Barrio Adentro) and hotels. That number translates to about 0.8 beds per 1,000 people, fewer than the 3 per 1,000 recommended by the World Health Organization.ARI also reported that only 57 percent of hospitals have continuous water supply, and 43 percent have insufficient or no protective gear – such as gowns, surgical and face masks – for doctors and nurses. It also notes that there are only 15 operational ambulances for the entire hospital network.For nearly a decade amid the country’s political and economic turmoil, Venezuela's healthcare system has severely deteriorated. PAHO reported in 2018 that about 22,000 out of the country's 66,138 doctors (one third of registered physicians) had left the country by 2014. Tomas Páez, a migration expert at the Central University of Venezuela, told the Washington Post in 2018 that the exodus was leading hospitals to close down entire floors. Illnesses including malaria, measles and tuberculosis have resurfaced in the country, and chronic diseases like cancer are left untreated. Since 2016, measles outbreaks have spread. From 2016 to 2017, Venezuela saw a 69 percent increase in malaria cases – the largest increase in the world. Between 2017 and 2018, most HIV patients stopped treatment because of lack of medication, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal.In February, a general surgeon in Maracaibo told U.S. public broadcaster PBS the country’s health care system was like ""living in the 19th century, when the hospitals didn't have water, when there was no electricity.""By June, a survey by the nonprofit Venezuelan Observatory of Public Services (OVSP) said 60 percent of respondents didn't have quality services to adequately deal with the quarantine. Nearly 65 percent said they lacked enough water to maintain hygiene practices, and 62 percent said they lacked internet capacity to remotely work or attend school. Famine is also a growing concern, in part due to the fact that Venezuela has the world's highest rate of inflation. The minimum monthly wage in Venezuela is 400,000 bolivares, which currently is worth about $2. That’s not enough to buy 500 grams of butter ($2.60), 30 eggs ($3) or a kilo of powdered milk ($2.30), per the prices of products on April 25.""The economic collapse dates back to times when Hugo Chávez ruled and was accelerated with his successor,"" said journalist Mendez.Production of Venezuela’s main export – oil – has plummeted to the lowest level since 1945, according to Bloomberg News. Venezuela has the world's largest reserves of crude oil but lacks refineries and must import gasoline. And U.S. sanctions – for alleged human rights violations and corruption, among other things – have kept crude oil buyers away.VENEZUELA -- The Iranian oil tanker Fortune is anchored at the dock of El Palito refinery near Puerto Cabello, May 25, 2020.Maduro, Chávez's anointed successor, blames the country's economic collapse on the U.S. sanctions. His leading political opponent, Juan Guaidó, has accused Maduro of covering up the severity of the pandemic. Nonetheless, the Maduro government’s Health Ministry and health officials with the Guaidó-led National Assembly agreed on June 1 to work together to combat the virus.Since a disputed election in 2018, Maduro and Guaidó have been locked in a political stalemate over control of the country. Led by the U.S., some 65 countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s leader, while the U.N. still recognizes Maduro and has pushed for a negotiated resolution.";https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-venezuela-west/venezuelas-zulia-state-emerges-as-coronavirus-hot-spot-idUSKBN23U2ZH,https://twitter.com/NicolasMaduro/status/1274831496164016131,http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR_Venezuela%20Situation_25%20May%202020.pdf,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/26/venezuela-urgent-aid-needed-combat-covid-19,https://www.ghsindex.org/country/venezuela/,https://www.as-coa.org/articles/where-coronavirus-latin-america#venezuela,https://acfiman.org/2020/05/08/estado-actual-de-la-epidemia-de-la-covid-19-en-venezuela-y-sus-posibles-trayectorias-bajo-varios-escenarios/,https://versionfinal.com.ve/politica-dinero/diosdado-cabello-informe-de-la-academia-de-la-ciencia-es-una-invitacion-a-un-tun-tun/,https://twitter.com/acfimanve/status/1260763656716988422,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-venezuela-west/venezuelas-zulia-state-emerges-as-coronavirus-hot-spot-idUSKBN23U2ZH,https://alianza.shorthandstories.com/covid-19-la-crisis-de-los-hospitales-no-es-un-caso-importado/index.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJzTJh-T2Y,https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/04/04/venezuelas-humanitarian-emergency/large-scale-un-response-needed-address-health,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30344-7/fulltext#articleInformation,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/sick-venezuelans-struggle-to-survive-amid-crumbling-health-system-lack-of-care,https://www.observatoriovsp.org/ovsp-alrededor-del-60-de-los-consultados-carece-de-calidad-en-los-servicios-de-agua-y-telecomunicaciones-durante-el-confinamiento/,https://twitter.com/ReporteYa/status/1254431069245444096/photo/1,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/venezuela-s-oil-production-plunges-to-lowest-level-since-1945?sref=eb344U1i,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/venezuela-65-countries-support-guaido-backs-maduro-190215134801090.html;Maduro Downplays Venezuela’s Coronavirus Disaster;;;;;;

The last sentence reads: “Beat whites until they turn black!” The text was reposted on the Telegram by Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT (state-owned news outlet Russia Today) and published in a more polished form (although still containing racial language) in one of Russia’s most popular newspapers.The author of the post is Dmitry Steshin, special political correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP), a national tabloid. It appeared in the paper’s “World politics” section.KP distributes more copies than any other newspaper in Russia – about 40 million monthly - and its website has 20 million visits a month.Since the protests over Floyd’s death in police custody began in the U.S. on May 25, Komsomolskaya Pravda has run a series of reports from different American cities. Each has cited a local resident, an eyewitness who happens to be a “Russian girl” asking to remain anonymous.The life stories of these girls are slightly different, though oddly they all came to the U.S. from Siberia. At first glance, their accounts of U.S. events seem fairly credible, but there are distortions.Komsomolskaya Pravda, June 1, 2020 report about the protests in Minneapolis, MN.A June 1 KP story about Minneapolis, which described the city “drowning in hatred,” quoted a “Russian girl” describing chaos and peoples’ fear of being “abandoned by the police” and left to the mercy of violent protesters.""In the news, they are now are talking about the first people killed and even raped in Minneapolis,” she is quoted as saying.This is false.While violence, injuries, looting and damaged property have been widely reported, VOA was unable to find any media or law enforcement reports of protest-related rapes in Minnesota.According to the Associated Press, at least 11 people have been killed nationwide during the protests, with three cases directly linked to the unrest and others still under investigation, including the one in Minneapolis. (The news report about Minneapolis death came out on June 2 – a day after KP piece was published.)The same KP story reported that “walking to the vigil people created at the site of George Floyd’s death is prohibited after the Pentagon brought the troops in.” That is also false. On May 28, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declared a state of peacetime emergency and activated the National Guard, but no troops were brought in from out of state. The nighttime curfew which Waltz ordered the following day only prohibited outdoor activities from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.The site of George Floyd’s death is open to the public and has become a place for people to gather and share their grief.Margarita Simonyan is the chief editor of the Russian government’s multimillion-dollar media conglomerate MIA Rossiya Segodnya, which includes RT and Sputnik. She did not explain why she shared Steshin’s Telegram post.When Simonyan’s re-post came under scrutiny from Bellingcat, an investigative website, RT’s Twitter account tweeted that many in Russia are ignorant of the racist connotation the label “negro” has for some in the U.S. Simonyan lived and studied in the U.S. during her senior year of high school. She has previously used the word “negro/s”.Another prominent Russian capitalizing on the U.S. unrest is Ramzan Kadyrov, the governor of Chechnya, who has been repeatedly criticized by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the U.S. government for a range of civil rights violations and attacks on journalists.“With horror I am watching the situation in the U.S., where the rights of common citizens have been brutally violated by the authorities,” Kadyrov wrote in a statement published on the website of Ekho Mosvky (Echo of Moscow) radio station.In the United States, various commentators took note of the irony in Russia’s response to the Floyd protests.“America’s heartbreak brought considerable joy to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, but the gloating also exposes the deep ugliness of his regime,” U.S. analyst Julia Davis wrote in a Daily Beast piece about Russian media coverage.Iran and China also accused the U.S. government of hypocrisy and cited the events to defend their own controversial policies, such as China’s crackdown on the Hong Kong protests, which politicians, the State Department and others have criticized.“The whole world has watched as things unravel in the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday, according to the Washington Examiner. “American politicians had better get their own house in order.”Zhao’s comment came just ahead of the June 4 anniversary of the Chinese government’s violent suppression of protests in Tianamen Square in 1989. Hundreds are believed to have been killed.The network analysis firm Graphika issued a report Wednesday that used artificial intelligence to review social media traffic. The report cited a graphic posted by Russia’s Sputnik outlet stating: “America 2020: Where anti-racists are terrorists and racists are president.”According to NBC, the Graphika analysis did not find evidence of a covert Russian campaign to influence the protests.Russia’s response to the Floyd protests has historic precedent.Jelani Cobb, a Columbia Journalism School professor, wrote an article published in The New Yorker magazine in 2018 headlined, “The Enduring Russian Propaganda Interests in Targeting African-Americans."" Cobb was writing in the context of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election in an effort to help Trump win.""During the Cold War, Soviet school curricula highlighted the exploitation of black people as a prime example of both American hypocrisy and of the rapacious nature of the capitalist system,” Cobb wrote. “Communist publications in the United States hired black writers and advocated for racial equality. That propaganda tradition of the old Soviet Union came back into view with Vladimir Putin, former KGB agent.""A screenshot of the Russian state-owned Sputnik news agency front page report on June 4, 2020.A study of social media posts conducted for the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that prior to 2016, Russian state-backed internet operatives “created an expansive cross-platform media mirage targeting the Black community, which shared and cross-promoted authentic Black media to create an immersive influence ecosystem.”That included posting thousands of YouTube videos relating to Black Lives Matter and police violence and maintaining 30 Facebook pages directed at African Americans that attracted more than 1 million followers.At the same time, Russian operatives created anti-Black Lives Matter accounts on social media, purchasing ads and promoting white supremacist ideology, The Washington Post reported.In a blog post summarizing its study, Graphika noted that Russian media and media posts about the Floyd protests attacked Human Rights Watch, falsely accused former President Barack Obama of inciting violence, called Trump a “coward” and condemned attacks by police on journalists covering the demonstrations.“Overall, however, the Russian coverage and commentary on the U.S. protests focused more on the nationwide unrest and the authorities’ response, in line with earlier practice of reporting on genuine grievances in the West and letting the events speak for themselves,” Graphika said.";https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/leni-riefenstahl,https://t.me/s/margaritasimonyan/6157,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27136.5/4227260/,https://mediaguide.ru/?p=house&house_id=04,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27136/4228934/,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27135/4227757/,https://mn.gov/governor/news/executiveorders.jsp,https://apnews.com/864cb5c14ba08b4411a16577042d0773,https://mn.gov/governor/assets/EO%2020-64%20Final_tcm1055-433855.pdf,https://mn.gov/governor/assets/EO%2020-65%20Final_tcm1055-434635.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=Margarita%20Simonyan&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-simonyan-fara-russia-us/28868377.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-fara-fact-check/28858396.html,https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1267728936672415745?s=20,https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/19/living/biracial-black-identity-answers/index.html,https://www.goodhouse.ru/stars/news/margarita-simonyan-rasskazala-o-zhizni-v-amerike-i-poprosila-proshcheniya-u-druga-yunosti/,https://t.me/margaritasimonyan/6165,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=kadyrov&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://echo.msk.ru/blog/rkadyrov_95/2653162-echo/,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-gloating-about-us-unrest-is-racist-af,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/china-and-russia-use-george-floyd-unrest-to-make-case-against-democracy,https://graphika.com/posts/briefing-china-iran-and-russia-state-accounts-on-u-s-protests/,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-enduring-russian-propaganda-interests-in-targeting-african-americans,https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/533-read-report-internet-research-agency/7871ea6d5b7bedafbf19/optimized/full.pdf#page=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/russian-operatives-used-facebook-ads-to-exploit-divisions-over-black-political-activism-and-muslims/2017/09/25/4a011242-a21b-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html,https://graphika.com/posts/briefing-china-iran-and-russia-state-accounts-on-u-s-protests/;U.S. Protests Incite Racist Words, Mockery from Moscow;;;;;;
270;;;;Misleading;Donald Trump;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/trump-antifa-tweet-fact-check/6742437.html;Trump’s Antifa Tweet: Conflation and Confusion;2020-06-02;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Protests erupted in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25 after the video the arrest and death of African American George Floyd spread across social platforms and the news media.Peaceful demonstrations in cities across the country sometimes turned violent and destructive, with buildings and vehicles crashed and on fire from Texas to California and even Washington, D.C.In Minnesota, the state authorities initially blamed the violence on “outside” radical extremist groups – a claim that media reports contradicted, citing police arrest data that included mostly locals.Then, on Sunday, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter with a post citing the far-left, loosely organized anarchist group “antifa” (short for anti-fascist) as instigator of the violence.“The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Trump tweeted on Sunday.The statement is misleading.While the law allows the United States to designate foreign groups as terrorists, providing the imposition of sanctions, there is no parallel domestic terrorism law to authorize such a designation.Instead, cases of alleged domestic terrorism are typically investigated as criminal matters under other federal and state laws. The Justice Department and FBI also work in conjunction with state and local law enforcement as part of Joint Terrorism Task Forces.Trump’s tweet prompted wide debate – with critics questioning his authority to make such a designation and others claiming it really didn’t matter, since there were plenty of laws that applied.It also sparked debate about the nature of antifa – an “organization” with no leaders and members who often group in small cells with the shared goals of being disruptive and anti-authoritarian.Although thought of in the U.S. as a domestic group, antifa has members who identify with the cause worldwide. In Canada, antifa expanded as a movement against the far-right and white supremacy. “Antifa is not a group,” one member of the movement told the Jesuit Review in a 2018 article. “It is an objective.”In the U.S., Trump and allies have tried to associate antifa with the radical left. Attorney General William Barr, in a pair of statements over the weekend, first said, “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchistic and far-left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics.”“The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” he added the next day, echoing Trump.Neither the Justice Department, the FBI nor the White House has provided direct evidence of that antifa incited any of the violence. Some reports have suggested right-wing groups could be involved. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, authorities identified a young white animal-rights activist as an alleged instigator.“The truth is, nobody really knows,” Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s Democratic attorney general said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”The president’s supporters say the Patriot Act, passed after the 9/11 terror attacks by al Qaida in New York City, Washington and Pennsylvania, defines domestic terrorism and could provide grounds to designate antifa a terrorist organization. The act states that:“the term “domestic terrorism” means activities that—(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;(B) appear to be intended—(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States;” Others argue that a designation is beside the point.“There is no need to designate a domestic insurrectionist group as a terrorist organization, because there is an extensive panoply of laws, at the state and federal level, by which such groups can be investigated, prosecuted, and otherwise thwarted,” Andrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney wrote June 1 in the National Review.McCarthy led the prosecution of perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a case that played out before the 1996 law that allowed for designating foreign terror organizations.“The lack of a designation process did not matter a whit. Because the jihadists’ plotting and attacks took place on U.S. soil, the full scope of U.S. law applied to all their activities,” McCarthy wrote.A proposed amendment to the U.S. anti-terrorism law to specifically target antifa was proposed in 2018 but stalled in the U.S. Congress.The issue surfaced again last year after a white supremacist gunned down 20 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. He left a manifesto complaining of a “Hispanic invasion.” The president of the FBI Agents Association called on Congress to make domestic terrorism a crime to “ensure that F.B.I. agents and prosecutors have the best tools to fight domestic terrorism.”The American Civil Liberties Union and other rights groups have been suspicious of such a law and the potential for abuse. Even former prosecutor McCarthy says such a law could be problematic.“Since we already have a slew of criminal laws for investigating terrorists, the only point of such a designation would be to permit the surveillance of Americans in the absence of probable cause that they have committed crimes,” he wrote. Still, “We should absolutely treat Antifa as a terrorist organization.”Trump’s critics noted that antifa can’t really be described as an “organization” because it has no official leadership or hierarchy.A 2017 intelligence assessment by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI describes antifa as a network of coordinated cells organized for “domestic terrorist violence.”Historian Mark Bray of Rutgers University is author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook."" Writing in the Washington Post on Monday, June 1, Bray said Trump’s characterizations of antifa “intentionally misrepresent the anti-fascist movement in the interest of delegitimizing militant protest and deflecting attention away from the white supremacy and police brutality that the protests oppose.”“But antifa itself,” Bray wrote, “is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity.”It should be noted that Bray, in an earlier Washington Post op-ed published in 2017, described antifa as “a radical pan-leftist politics of social revolution applied to fighting the far right,” whose adherents “are predominantly communists, socialists and anarchists who reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy.”Whatever the true nature of antifa, the Trump administration is blaming it for the wave of rioting in U.S. cities.Asked on CNN about the violence and property destruction, Trump’s new national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said: “This is being driven by Antifa. Whatever they are, they’re — they’re militants who are coming in and burning our cities, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.”On Monday evening, Trump in the Rose Garden called on mayors and governors to use “overwhelming law enforcement presence” to put down violent protests. Shortly after, a phalanx of officers with shields and helmets fired rubber bullets and used tear gas to move peaceful protesters away from a church near the White House.Trump then walked to the church with Barr and other officials and posed for cameras while raising a Bible.";https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007159353/george-floyd-arrest-death-video.html,https://apnews.com/c743eaecd9a5948a4576565b12e3230d,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests/fires-burn-near-white-house-in-violent-us-protests-idUSKBN2370HH,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-blame-outsiders-for-violence-in-minnesota-but-contradict-each-other-on-who-is-responsible/2020/05/30/d722e9d6-a2b1-11ea-b5c9-570a91917d8d_story.html,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552?s=20,https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-intimate-history-of-antifa?source=search_google_dsa_paid&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgb7o7_Lg6QIVibWzCh3AuAOpEAMYASAAEgKeWvD_BwE,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/domestic-terror-law.html,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/antifa-terrorist-organization-designation-trump.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/what-antifa-trump.html,https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2018/08/13/how-canadas-antifa-groups-are-organizing-fight-growing-far-right?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIufjM4M_h6QIVxR6tBh341w9kEAMYASAAEgJD_vD_BwE,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barrs-statement-riots-and-domestic-terrorism,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-protests-white-supremacists-antifa.html,https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2020/5/31/21276134/george-floyd-protests-officials-blame-differing-groups-outsiders-violence-antifa-lightfoot-hopkins,https://www.voanews.com/usa/four-extremist-groups-suspected-involvement-protest-violence,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/protests-white-instigators/2020/06/01/b916bd98-a426-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html,https://www.nationalreview.com/videos/trump-wants-to-label-antifa-a-terrorist-group/,https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/george-floyd-protests-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization-not-necessary/,https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr6054/BILLS-115hr6054ih.pdf,https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/antifa-crackdown-a-proposal-not-law/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/domestic-terror-law.html,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/antifa-terrorist-organization-designation-trump.html,https://publicintelligence.net/dhs-fbi-anarchist-extremists/,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/01/antifa-charlottesville-violence-fbi-242235,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/01/trump-antifa-terrorist-organization/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/08/16/who-are-the-antifa/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/can-trump-use-military-to-stop-protests-insurrection-act/2020/06/01/c3724380-a46b-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-push-to-tear-gas-protesters-ahead-of-a-trump-photo-op/2020/06/01/4b0f7b50-a46c-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html;Trump’s Antifa Tweet: Conflation and Confusion;;;;;;

Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been demonstrating for weeks leading up to and after the action by the National People’s Congress, the Communist Party’s rubber-stamp legislature in China.China's President Xi Jinping (C), Premier Li Keqiang (R) and Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Wang Yang (L) applaud after the vote on a proposal to draft a Hong Kong security law during the closing session of theIn an editorial from the Congress, China’s state news agency Xinhua said adoption of the law “showed that all the Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, have demonstrated their common belief and strong determination to safeguard national security.""The implication of broad support in Hong Kong is misleading.Taking protests aside, last November’s local elections in Hong Kong, combined with follow-up polling, suggests that a majority of residents have issues with China’s influence on local government.Fueled by younger voters, pro-democracy candidates won what was reported as a landslide victory in local district council seats. The result was widely seen as a rebuke of the Chinese government and its allies on the council, including Mayor Carrie Lam. In mid-December, the Reuters news agency followed-up with a survey that showed 59% support for the pro-democracy movement. More of those who responded said they had attended protests in the summer of 2019 that Chinese government officials condemned.The demonstrations began in opposition to a Hong Kong government bill to allow accused criminals to be sent to China for trial. The bill eventually was dropped, and Lam’s popularity nosedived.To be sure, the Reuters poll results did not show a complete divorce from China. Only 17% said they supported Hong Kong’s independence from China, while only 20% opposed the “one country two systems” arrangement under which the British agreed in 1997 to return Hong Kong to eventual Chinese control after 50 years.Under that agreement, Hong Kong residents were to retain such rights as freedom of speech and assembly, along with a free media and independent judiciary.The new security law is China’s latest and strongest declaration of authority in a series of escalating skirmishes with Hong Kong.CHINA -- Protesters set up defense shield using umbrellas on a road in Mongkok, Hong Kong, Wednesday, May 27, 2020. Hong Kong ProtestsProtests over the transfer agreement and autonomy erupted in 2014 in the so-called “Umbrella Revolution.” The issue then was whether Hong Kong residents had the right to freely elect their leaders. The protests ended with no political concessions.The new law would allow the Communist Party-run mainland government more power to suppress protests and shut down activists for national security reasons.The new legislation passed on Thursday would allow mainland authorities to suppress the protests and shut down activist groups under the guise of national security. The move has been criticized by the United States, Japan and Germany, among others, as a crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy and violation of “one country, two systems.” The Trump administration has retaliated by saying it will remove some of Hong Kong’s special trade privileges with the United States, a potentially major blow to the city’s status as an international hub for finance and commerce.On May 27, the day before the Chinese security bill was approved, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted:“Today, I reported to Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China, given facts on the ground. The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong.”China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, earlier sought to minimize the reach of the law, the South China Morning Post reported on May 24.""The NPC decision is targeted at a narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardize national security,"" Wang said.

This is fake and disinformation in the spirit of previous American administrations,"" said Andrey Krasov, deputy chair of Russian Duma Defense Committee.The claim is false.Reports about Russia air assets going to Libya appeared a week before the AFRICOM’s statement. On May 21, Fathi Bashagha, the GNA’s security chief in Tripoli, told Bloomberg News that “at least six MiG 29s and two Sukhoi 24s had flown into the east from the Russian-controlled Hmeimim Air Base in Syria, escorted by two Su-35 Russian air force jets.”Some analysts questioned Bashagha’s claim.Commenting on the reported deployment of Russian military aircraft to Libya in his blog, The Aviationist, Rome-based freelance journalist David Cenciotti wrote that he was ""not sure this actually happened, at least not the way it has been reported.""However, in an update to his May 21 blog entry, Cenciotti reported that a satellite image showing one MiG-29 being towed at al-Jufra air base had confirmed the presence of at least one such Russian fighter jet in Libya. On May 26, The Aviationist discussed the impact of this development on the power balance in Libya.On May 21, another confirmation came from Jeffrey Bardin, a U.S. Air Force veteran and a cyber intelligence analyst, who posted on LinkedIn a satellite image of al-Jufra air base, showing “the presence of a MiG-29 fighter and a number of other fighters.”The Drive, a website that covers military affairs and cars, reported on May 21, 26 and 27 the presence of multiple Russian fighter jets on the airbase in the LNA-controlled territory. The site said the jets “were indeed at Russia's air base in western Syria just days before the MiG-29 was spotted in Libya.”Airwars.org, a U.K.-based military aviation watchdog, has been monitoring this situation since May 20, Chris Woods, the website’s director, told Polygraph.info.“It's reasonable to conclude that fighter aircraft have recently been supplied to the LNA by Russia,” Woods said. “What remains unclear is whether those aircraft will be flown by mercenaries or by pilots with the Russian air force.” On May 26, the LNA's Army Twitter account also retweeted the AFRICOM's report about the deployment of the Russian aircraft, without denying it.According to the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik, an LNA representative speaking on Al Arabiya TV called AFRICOM’s statements about the arrival of Russian military aircraft in Libya “strange.” However, there was no indication the LNA representative denied it had happened.The United Nations imposed Arms embargo on Libya in 2011.The civil war in Libya is becoming “increasingly internationalized,” Airwars.org’s Chris Woods said. On one side, Turkey is providing military support to the Tripoli-based GNA; on the other, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia are backing the LNA forces lead by Khalifa Haftar.Russia has denied involvement in Libya, but a recently leaked U.N. report said Moscow has deployed about 1,200 mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group to strengthen Haftar’s forces.Central Asian sources report that Wagner has been actively recruiting mercenaries in war-impoverished Syria “using the same tactics as ISIS” – promising big rewards but instead using the new recruits as cannon fodder.Libya has been in turmoil for the last nine years. The UN estimates that hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands injured, while millions have reportedly been forcibly displaced and are in dire need of humanitarian aid.";https://www.africom.mil/media-room/pressrelease/32789/russia-deploys-military-fighter-aircraft-to-libya?fbclid=IwAR0lgtBQLZcUsA2KJRPsjaZyhoGoxD9UYrIf7raG5ksJXgQ-Qv-y5dOSsPc,https://www.dvidshub.net/image/6220925/russia-deploys-military-fighter-aircraft-libya,https://twitter.com/DeptofDefense/status/1265365996606353408?s=20,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/haftar-s-forces-announce-air-campaign-against-turkey-in-libya,https://theaviationist.com/2020/05/21/lets-talk-about-the-claim-that-russia-moved-six-mig-29s-and-two-su-24s-escorted-by-ruaf-su-35s-to-libya/,https://theaviationist.com/2020/05/26/u-s-africa-command-confirms-russia-deployed-military-fighter-aircraft-to-libya-shares-images/,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbardin?trk=public-post_share-update_actor-text,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6669368543496175616,http://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6669368543496175616/,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33618/mysterious-mig-29-fighter-appears-at-libyan-air-base-held-by-russian-backed-forces,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33666/mig-29-fighters-were-at-russias-air-base-in-syria-just-before-showing-up-in-libya,https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33698/russia-now-has-at-least-14-combat-jets-in-libya-as-satellite-images-reveal-new-details,https://twitter.com/LNA2019M/status/1265250229193969671,https://sputniknews.com/world/202005271079426122-lna-surprised-by-claims-of-russian-aircraft-in-libya---spokesman/,https://www.undocs.org/en/S/RES/1970%20(2011),https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-usa-idUSKBN2321RQ,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/russian-military-group-deployed-1200-people-libya-report-200507113646940.html,https://central.asia-news.com/ru/articles/cnmi_ca/features/2020/05/21/feature-01,https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/05/interview-libyas-chaos-explained,https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/first_quarter_civilian_casualty_report_2020_0.pdf,https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/acting_srsg_briefing_to_the_security_council_-_19_may_2020.pdf;MiGs in Libya, Contradicting Moscow's Denials;;;;;;

Second, he said, Trump was angry at Iran for refusing U.S. coronavirus humanitarian aid. Third, he said Trump is trying to boost oil prices by threatening possible military action in the Middle East.The last sentence in the Sputnik report implies that Washington has been hiding military casualties suffered in the January Iranian missile strike in Iraq, which was in retaliation for the U.S. airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.""On the night of January 8, Iran launched a missile strike on the American military infrastructure in Iraq. The number of victims of this attack was not disclosed.""The claim is false.The sentence echoes a previously debunked Iranian claim that the missile strike killed 80 U.S. troops.The U.S. initially reported no casualties, but later announced 11 troops had been treated for concussion symptoms after the attack, and the number of those suffering traumatic brain injuries eventually grew to 111.Along with American troops, the bases targeted by Iran housed military personnel from at least seven other nations participating in the coalition to defeat ISIS. These included Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Norway and Poland. None reported casualties.After Trump’s “shoot and destroy” tweet, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, issued his own rejoinder that any actions threatening Iran forces “will be met with an immediate and decisive response.”U.S. officials say Iran has escalated harassment of U.S. naval vessels patrolling the Persian Gulf oil shipping lanes.According to an April 15 U.S. Navy Central Command press release, “11 Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) vessels repeatedly conducted dangerous and harassing approaches” while six U.S. vessels were “conducting joint integration operations with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters in the international waters of the North Arabian Gulf.”The Iranian navy has been videoing these interactions, and the videos have been broadcast on Iran’s official channels.Some U.S. and EU analysts agreed with Ibragimov that Trump was calculating the impact that such a move would have on oil prices.Still, the views of this Kremlin-linked expert echo Tehran’s, and similar opinions have been pushed extensively by regime-controlled Iranian media.Iran’s disinformation campaign in the wake of Soleimani’s killing on Jan. 3 featured some unusual claims, including that the CIA’s Iran chief died in a plane crash in Afghanistan.Iran initially denied the Jan. 8 shoot down of a Ukrainian passenger airliner departing Tehran. Leaders later admitted that its air defenses mistook the airliner for a U.S. military jet. All 178 people on board died.";https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252932181447630848?s=20,https://radiosputnik.ria.ru/20200422/1570433885.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-saudi-oil-price-us-lng-fact-check/30482432.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/trump-soleimani-strike-russia/30359204.html,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-these-images-of-us-soldiers-coffins-don-t-show-iran-s-revenge-1635819-2020-01-10,https://apnews.com/c7116313efdb56f4e928289faa1ad8cd,https://news.trust.org/item/20200117170342-xr08c,https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/voa-news-iran/11-us-troops-treated-concussion-symptoms-after-iranian-attack,https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-military-raises-injury-toll-in-iran-missile-attack-in-iraq/30448623.html,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a30444584/iran-missile-attack/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-targets/iran-believed-to-have-deliberately-missed-u-s-forces-in-iraq-strikes-sources-idUSKBN1Z7283,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/top-iranian-general-warns-us-against-dangerous-behavior-in-persian-gulf-after-trump-threat/2020/04/23/659b44c0-8551-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111_story.html,https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/IMAGERY/igphoto/2002282012/,https://www.cusnc.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/2151642/irgcn-vessels-conduct-unsafe-unprofessional-interaction-with-us-naval-forces-in/,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/04/23/623722/Iran-dismisses-Trump-military-threats-hollow-self-defeating?jwsource=cl,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/oil-rally-continues-iran-reacts-to-trump-shoot-down-threat,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-oil-sees-double-digit-rise-as-traders-point-to-escalating-middle-east-tensions-2020-04-23,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/04/23/623729/Trump-anti-Iran-threats-aimed-diverting-public-attention-COVID-19,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/04/23/623722/Iran-dismisses-Trump-military-threats-hollow-self-defeating,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/false-claims-spread-online-after-iran-missile-attack-on-iraqi-airbase,https://www.polygraph.info/a/iran-russia-cia-afghanistan-fact-check/30416888.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/iran-ps752-missile-fact-check/30371408.html;Russia Seasons Escalating Trump-Iran Tensions With Disinfo;;;;;;

Children do not die, do not get ill, do not end up in intensive care up to 20 years old.""The claim is false.Globally, statistics concerning children with COVID-19 come largely from a few studies from China that some scientists say are unreliable. These studies suggested that children younger than 18 were less likely to develop serious or critical conditions compared to adults.Still, these studies showed that children are not immune. Of 2,143 pediatric patients in one Chinese study, most had mild symptoms – but one child, a 14-year-old boy, did die. Among children, infants had a higher risk of severe disease.In another one-month study of 1,391 cases at Wuhan Children’s hospital found that 13 percent had COVID-19. The median age was 6.7 years; as of March 10, only a 10-month old infant died.VIETNAM -- Children wearing a face mask as a preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19 novel coronavirus ride their bicycles in Hanoi on March 20, 2020.The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated in a report published on April 6 that among 149,082 (99.6%) reported COVID-19 cases for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) were among children younger than 18 years. Of those, an estimated 5.7- 20 percent were hospitalized, 0.58-2.0 percent were placed in an intensive care unit and three died.The Russian health ministry’s website has a COVID-19 page, but it does not include demographics.Some data can be found in an April 16 report available on the Russian Pediatricians Union’s website. While mainly focused on Chinese and American studies, the report also cites data from the Russian Federal Children Reanimation-Consultation Center indicating that, as of April 12, 10 children were hospitalized with severe respiratory infection from COVID-19.Two of them were on ventilators (compared to April 8, when four children were in intensive care, three of them on ventilators).RUSSIA -- Specialists wearing protective mask and suit escort a patient to a multi-specialty hospital complex in the Kommunarka settlement in New Moscow, March 16, 2020Another study published by the Journal of Health Management and Practice on April 16 had a rather gloomy prognosis regarding U.S. hospital care for children with COVID-19.After analyzing the U.S. and China data on COVID-19 infections among children with a modeling software, the study predicted, that “[b]ecause there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources.”Inside Russia, the COVID-19 pandemic is creating social tensions. On Monday, anti-quarantine protests broke out in the Russian North Caucasus, with the riot police cracking down on the protesters.A day earlier, on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin told the nation in a televised address that Russia had the coronavirus “under full control.”“With God’s help everything will be good,” he said.Russia, with a population of about 146 million, has a relatively low number of reported COVID-19 cases -- 52,763 -- with 456 deaths from the disease as of April 21. Doctors and public health experts criticized Putin’s address. The Moscow Times earlier quoted experts as saying that while health care in Russia is free and fully government funded, the government has neglected the system for over a decade, and it is already running out of capacity.RUSSIA -- Workers constructing a new hospital for coronavirus patients outside the village of Golokhvastovo, some 60 kilometers southwest from the center of Moscow, April 20, 2020Russian doctors were also quoted as saying that the relatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Russia was mainly due to misdiagnosis and the use of pneumonia “as a cover up for coronavirus cases.”Public figures in Russia, including top lawmakers, have been pushing the idea that Russians are somehow immune from coronavirus.Indeed, Aleksandr Myasnikov, whom Putin put in charge of the government’s COVID-19 Monitoring Center, has been nicknamed “Doctor COVID doesn’t take Russians” for his frequent repetition of the phrase during TV appearances.";https://www.1tv.ru/shows/zdorove,https://www.facebook.com/tvcnewsofficial/videos/vb.285734512104532/222614092403765/?type=2&theater,https://hms.harvard.edu/news/covid-19-children,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm,https://covid19.rosminzdrav.ru/,http://www.pediatr-russia.ru/COVID-19/detail.php?ELEMENT_CODE=koronavirusnaya-infektsiya-u-detey,https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Abstract/9000/COVID_19_in_Children_in_the_United_States_.99293.aspx%5d,https://www.newsweek.com/child-coronavirus-cases-hospitals-overwhelmed-1498855,https://twitter.com/Fidar_Khubaev/status/1252261290967470085?s=20,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-putin/putin-says-coronavirus-crisis-under-full-control-despite-record-rise-in-cases-idUSKBN2210GA,https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/16/russias-healthcare-system-faced-cuts-for-years-now-medical-students-are-on-the-coronavirus-frontlines-a69998,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-russia-s-low-infection-numbers-viewed-skeptically-n1166101,https://nsn.fm/society/v-sovfede-zayavili-chto-koronavirus-russkih-ne-beryot,https://www.rosbalt.ru/like/2020/04/15/1838500.html;‘Miracle of Miracles’: Russia’s Star Doctor Wrongly Says Children 'Do Not Die' of COVID-19;;;;;;

The City Will Seal Your Door from the Outside;2020-04-17;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, was the first country in the region to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with its first three cases confirmed on March 13.Now, more than a month later, the country’s coronavirus statistics remain relatively low: As of April 17, Kazakhstan, with a total population of 18.7 million, had reported 1,498 COVID-19 positive cases and 17 deaths. (COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus behind the pandemic.)The country has been taking restrictive measures to fight the spread of COVID-19. The government declared a state of emergency and imposed nationwide lock downs and stay-at-home orders in mid-March, before the country recorded it first coronavirus victim.A screenshot of a Facebook post showing sealed doors in the apartment buildings in Kazakhstan as part of an anti-COVID-19 measureIn parts of Kazakhstan, however, the authorities went further with their quarantine measures, locking hundreds of residents inside their homes. A local journalist in Kazakhstan, Petr Trotsenko, told Dozhd, the independent Russian television channel, and Radio Azattyk, which is part of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, about this development.Photos and videos shared via social media showed apartment building entrance doors sealed from the outside. Added to these doors were small rectangular windows similar to those found in prison cells, through which groceries and other essentials can be passed.The posts named the city of Aktau as one of the places where this has happened.Located on the Caspian Sea coast and once a “secret” Soviet uranium mining city, Aktau now is Kazakhstan’s oil hub. Forbes magazine described the city as being “at a prime position on an emerging corridor of the New Silk Road.”An Aktau resident reportedly jumped out of a third-floor window and broke his back while trying to escape from an apartment building where he was sealed while visiting relatives. The entire multistory building was sealed after a middle-aged couple in one of the apartments tested positive for COVID-19, according to media reports. On April 4, the Aktau city administration tried to debunk these social media posts, saying on its official Instagram account that they were “incorrect.”“There has been a lot of incorrect information circulating in the posts with people claiming that the doors are being sealed, with just a small hole cut in them,” the Aktau akimat stated in a post in Russian.The claim is false.According to the online media agency Nur.kz, the Aktau city akimat claimed in the Khazakh language portion of its Instagram post that the entrance door of one of the apartment buildings, a photograph of which was posted online, had not been welded shut from the outside. Rather, it said, “only a latch has been welded to it from the outside.”The Aktau city administration posted a video showing a person wearing protective gear opening the heavy metallic door from outside. Another person was filmed shaking the freshly welded door latch to demonstrate that it could be moved.The video appeared to verify that the Aktau city administration had indeed been locking entrance doors of apartments from outside.;https://eurasianet.org/nerves-jangled-as-covid-19-finally-detected-in-kazakhstan,https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6,https://kz.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/,https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/insight/publications/2020/03/kazakhstan-state-of-emergency-covid19,https://eurasianet.org/kazakhstan-records-first-covid-19-fatality-in-central-asia,https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/here_and_now/v_kazahstane_zavarivajut_dveri-506813/?utm_term=506813&fbclid=IwAR0dw4pKz_2cWYJR8bBBZlbfJigEwJcJ5DQlXSKuYW25K0PHSWXnDtD2Z4w,https://rus.azattyq.org/a/kazakhstan-almaty-coronavirus-quarantine-reportage/30554544.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/04/15/a-look-inside-aktau-kazakhstans-other-hub-on-the-new-silk-road/#782ff397e1c3,https://www.nur.kz/1848994-muzcina-vyprygnul-iz-okna-zakrytoj-na-karantin-mnogoetazki-v-aktau.html,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-kXiGSni4q/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.nur.kz/1849105-foto-s-zavarennoj-dveru-podezda-iz-za-karantina-obasnili-v-akimate-aktau-video.html;COVID-19 Positive in Kazakhstan?

276;;;;Misleading;Anton Herashchenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/chernobyl-fires-radiation-fact-check/6742375.html;Radiation Levels And Wildfires Near Chernobyl;2020-04-15;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;On Tuesday, April 14, Ukrainian firefighters contained wildfires that have been raging for more than a week through Chernobyl’s exclusion zone – an area contaminated with radiation from the nuclear power plant accident there in 1986.The fire raged some 19 miles into the zone and was stopped just 600 feet from the Chernobyl plant itself, the BBC reported.Ukraine’s Emergency Situations Service said most of the fire was extinguished, but smoldering sections of forest floor remained throughout western parts of the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone. Rainfall after a weeks-long dry period helped, the agency said.UKRAINE -- Firefighters battle with a forest fire burns near the village of Ragovka, close to the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine, 10 April 2020The fire in Chernobyl came amid the panic over the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a surge of apocalyptic memes on social media but also raising concerns that smoke and wind could potentially spread radioactive contamination.International media reported elevated radiation levels in the area of the fire.The Associated Press cited a member of Ukraine’s public council in charge of Chernobyl exclusion zone, Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, as saying on Facebook that the situation was “critical.”The Guardian cited a Facebook post by the head of Ukraine’s state ecological inspection service that included a video of a Geiger counter showing a radiation level 16 times above normal.Reuters reported that aerial images of the exclusion zone around the destroyed nuclear plant “showed scorched, blackened earth and the charred stumps of still smoldering trees.”UKRAINE -- A satellite image from The Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) by NASA shows the area of fire nearby the Chernobyl. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus is seen on the left of the map.Later on Tuesday, Ukraine’s deputy interior minister, Anton Herashchenko, visited Chernobyl and gave assurances that all the fires would be extinguished. He also claimed the radiation level in the area was normal.“The firefighters did not allow the fire to move towards the town of Pripyat, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and nuclear waste storage facilities. There was no danger to the nuclear facilities of the Exclusion Zone at this fire. There is no increase in radiation background,” Herashchenko said.To confirm Herashchenko’s claim, Ukraine’s Emergency Situations Service published a photo showing a firefighter holding a Geiger counter showing a reading of 0.14 microSieverts per hour (mSv/h) – indicating a radiation level considered safe or normal.The claim is misleading.Ukraine uses the same system of measuring radiation levels as Russia and Europe. A background radiation level of 0.12 to 0.24 mSv per hour is considered normal.A chest X-ray delivers 0.1 mSv of radiation and a full-body CT scan 10 mSv. The maximum levels recorded at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan on March 14, 2011, after it melted down as a result of being struck by tsunami, was 400 mSv. Many of the workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant when it melted down in April 1986 received doses measuring 6,000 mSv and died within a month.Despite Herashchenko’s claim of “no increase,” several sources reported what they characterized as elevated levels.On Monday, Dmitry Shibalov, a member of Ukraine’s Chernobyl council, which oversees the exclusion zone, posted a video on Facebook from the abandoned village of Poliske, located inside the zone, some 36 miles from the defunct power plant. The video shows blackened trees still smoldering, with a Geiger counter in the foreground beeping and showing a reading of 0.42 mSv. “The level is a little above normal, but not significantly, and it’s very localized,” Shibalov wrote in a caption to the video.Ukrainian activists posted videos on Facebook taken near the fire in Chernobyl and showing readings as high as 2.3 mSv “at the center of the fire.”The latest wildfires are the largest in the exclusion zone since the nuclear accident, the head of the Eastern European Fire Monitoring Center, Sergiy Zibtsev, told Agence-France Presse. He estimated that the fires covered more than 50,000 acres in the western part of the zone.According to several studies and data, previous wildfires in Chernobyl were much smaller (the largest, in 2015, covered 3,700 acres). One study compared the 2015 fires as equivalent to a Level 3 nuclear event, “which corresponds to a serious incident, in which non-lethal deterministic effects are expected from radiation.”An aerial view through a window of a helicopter shows smoke from forest fires in northern Ukraine, April 28, 2015. Emergency services were battling to prevent Ukraine's largest forest fire since 1992 from spreading towards ChernobylOn April 15, Ukraine’s state Scientific Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety published data of the movement of “potentially contaminated air masses” toward Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, but said they were not hazardous.“The forecasted concentrations are not higher than those observed previously and do not pose a threat to the health of the population,” the Center said.Greenpeace, the environmental group, Tweeted a statement of concern.“Wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant burning since April 3 have already become the largest for the entire existence of this exclusion zone. These fires are extremely dangerous because radionuclides located in the upper soil layers might be released into the air,” Greenpeace said in a statement.The online investigative site Bellingcat reviewed satellite photos and other evidence about the fires, concluding that while there was cause for concern, “some international media outlets have made misleading claims about “spiking radiation levels.”Citing experts and government sources, the site said that “Local radiation levels seem to have increased, but there has been no immediate risk for citizens being exposed to dangerous levels of radiation.”;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52277414,https://mvs.gov.ua/ua/news/29825_Operativna_informaciya_shchodo_likvidacii_lisovih_pozhezh_na_teritorii_Zoni_vidchuzhennya.htm,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-china-covid-timeline/30542129.html,https://twitter.com/search?q=chernobyl%20fire%20apocalypse&src=typed_query,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/world/europe/chernobyl-wildfire.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes,https://apnews.com/70f9ec4ca1e68ad653245c4d45ce2f0e,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/bad-news-radiation-spikes-16-times-above-normal-after-forest-fire-near-chernobyl,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-chernobyl-fire-idUSKCN21V1QW?taid=5e94bb12922b190001d7f02a&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter,https://mvs.gov.ua/ua/news/29840_Anton_Gerashchenko_Dlya_likvidacii_pozhezhi_v_Zoni_vidchuzhennya_zaluchili_ryatuvalnikiv_iz_15_oblastey.htm,http://blog.vornaskotti.com/2010/07/15/into-the-zone-chernobyl-pripyat/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-quake-radiation/factbox-how-much-radiation-is-dangerous-idUSTRE72Q0HN20110327,https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/15/radiation-exposure-levels-guide,https://www.facebook.com/dmitriyshibalov/videos/2942889669109675/?__tn__=%2CdCH-R-R&eid=ARAnrW3JC70uJnSheDqZyPQ5Qz-mcH8WKTa7fK0IIlKoD3XFjUm18X0gU0ntal_X6Uku1xeDAGOnFnjE&hc_ref=ART7plI4NRcAGLK86iTsFjBoq4lnYpvr2RI9J6feuqUnqcvyMya6ci-EHk8vYDo1kWI&fref=nf,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chernobyl-radiation-levels-spike-dramatically-forest-fires-burn-exclusion-zone-n1177681,https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/kiev-says-huge-forest-fire-no-threat-chernobyl-nuclear-zone-doc-1qk7dp2,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.6034E/abstract,https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/58947,https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-6034.pdf,https://sstc.ua/news/rozrahunkovi-trayektoriyi-rozpovsyudzhennya-potencijno-zabrudnenogo-povitrya-na-osnovi-onovlenih-danih,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/14/chernobyl-burning-not-great-not-terrible/;Radiation Levels And Wildfires Near Chernobyl;;;;;;
277;;;;Misleading;Alex Jones;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/covid-19-fact-check-nanosilver-infowars/6742336.html;Infowars’ Jones Hawked ‘Nanosilver Toothpaste’ Fake Coronavirus Cure;2020-03-18;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;Alex Jones, the American far-right conspiracy theorist and businessman (net worth $10 million as of 2020) attempted to capitalize on coronavirus fears by claiming a toothpaste made by his Infowarslife company and sold online can cure COVID-19.On March 10, Jones devoted his online show to promoting conspiracies about the coronavirus outbreak. He brought up his toothpaste product.“The patented nanosilver we have, the Pentagon has come out and documented and Homeland Security has said this stuff kills the whole SARS-corona family at point-blank range. Well, of course it does, it kills every virus,” Jones said on that show.The claim that nanosilver in a toothpaste kills coronavirus is misleading.In fact, on March 9, a day before Jones’ program, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a joint statement warning about seven companies selling “fraudulent products that claim to treat or prevent COVID-19.”While Infowars was not among these companies, silver products were among those the FDA and FTC specifically cited as being “not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition.”On March 12, New York’s attorney general, Letita James, sent Jones a cease-and-desist notice to “immediately cease selling fake coronavirus treatments.” “Alex Jones has spewed outright lies and has profited off of New Yorkers’ anxieties,” James said. “Any individual, company, or entity that deceives the public and preys on innocent civilians will pay for their unlawful actions.”Infowars’ marketing site reacted by adding a new disclaimer concerning its products, stating: “The products on this site are not intended for use in the cure, treatment, prevention or mitigation of any disease, including the novel coronavirus. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and is expressly disavowed.”A Screenshot of the Infowars market page offering the Super Silver toothpasteJones has a history of making false or defamatory statements. The most infamous was his claim that the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was a “false flag” operation by the U.S. government to create the pretext to confiscate firearms, and that the parents of the children killed were “crisis actors.”Twenty students and six school employees died in the Sandy Hook mass shooting, and the parents of two of the victims sued Alex Jones.In December 2019, the court ordered Jones to pay $100,000 to the families of Sandy Hook victims.Several U.S. companies, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and Apple, banned Jones and his Infowars from their platforms.As for Infowars’ toothpaste, its list of ingredients includes “20ppm Patented Silver Solution (deionized water, silver)” -- or 20 parts per million, which shows how much silver the solution actually contains. For comparison, a 100g of pure laboratory form of nanosilver cost nearly $500. A screenshot of the Infowars market page showing a Super Silver toothpaste ingredientsA similar ingredient is listed on hundreds of nanosilver products sold globally, from baby blankets to adult socks to laundry detergents.The U.S. government-funded studies of nanomaterials have found that some forms of nanosilver have antibacterial properties. The use of nanosilver to combat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and other viruses has also been explored.“There are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects,” Dr Helene Langevin, director of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) division told Agency France Press.Experts have not reached a consensus on how much nanosilver is safe for humans. There have been cases of people who have used nanosilver in the form of oral supplements or nasal/eye drops whose skin has turned permanently blue – a condition called argyria.In addition, studies have found that high concentrations of silver in the body damage bone marrow and even alter DNA.In 2018, the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) reviewed the use of nanosilver in the cosmetics industry, including in toothpaste, and found: “Due to a number of major data gaps, the SCCS is not in the position to draw a conclusion on the safety of colloidal silver in nano form when used in oral and dermal cosmetic products.”During prior virus outbreaks, some companies have claimed their nanosilver products had “Pentagon-verified” healing properties. In September 2014, the FDA formally warned the Natural Solutions Foundation, which claimed its nanosilver products were effectively killing the Ebola virus.To stay safe and protect loved ones from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus in the current outbreak, the World Health Organization recommends reducing social interactions, practicing personal hygiene and watching out for fake claims regarding the pandemic.;https://wealthygorilla.com/alex-jones-net-worth/,https://apnews.com/b060689bfe9f0a9d7a159463183f88c3,https://www.brighteon.com/49a5de8c-23aa-433b-91ff-3c3abce8f872,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-update-fda-and-ftc-warn-seven-companies-selling-fraudulent-products-claim-treat-or,https://apnews.com/b7da77b5e9838e7982c52ff3de0cbe24,https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-orders-alex-jones-stop-selling-fake-coronavirus-treatments,https://www.infowarsstore.com/health-and-wellness/immune-defense/supersilver-whitening-toothpaste,https://www.mediamatters.org/alex-jones/sandy-hook-families-are-suing-alex-jones-what-he-said-about-shooting?redirect_source=/blog/2018/04/17/sandy-hook-families-are-suing-alex-jones-what-he-said-about-shooting/219976,https://apnews.com/f07ede9177eaa45b1792a5559c9c2593,https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories,https://www.silver-colloids.com/reports/ionic-silver-solutions/,https://www.us-nano.com/inc/sdetail/469?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl-PUtPKm6AIVi56zCh1cFA2tEAMYAyAAEgJSF_D_BwE,http://www.nanotechproject.org/process/assets/files/7039/silver_database_fauss_sept2_final.pdf,https://www.nano.gov/SensorsNSIPortal/SNOrganizations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3702006/,https://factcheck.afp.com/consuming-silver-particles-will-not-prevent-or-treat-novel-coronavirus,https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/nanosilver-naughty-or-nice,https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_219.pdf,https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/natural-solutions-foundation-09222014,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters;Infowars’ Jones Hawked ‘Nanosilver Toothpaste’ Fake Coronavirus Cure;;;;;;
278;;;;Misleading;Recep Tayyip Erdogan;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/turkey-syrian-refugees-europe-fact-check/6742332.html;Erdogan to Europe: ‘Who Are You Lying To?’ He’s Not Entirely Honest;2020-03-13;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"On Feb. 27, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced his country would no longer prevent millions of refugees who fled Syria to Turkey after the start of the Syrian civil war from crossing into Europe.The move came amid an escalation of the conflict between Turkey and Russia over the northwestern Syrian territory of Idlib, the site of fighting between Turkish and Russian-backed Syrian government forces. Both sides have reported casualties from attacks.Immediately after Erdogan’s announcement, thousands of refugees flooded Turkish border crossings into Greece and Bulgaria. Both of those countries increased border security, and violence erupted between security forces and refugees.On March 11, Erdogan went so far as to compare the actions of Greek security forces on the border with Turkey to those of the Nazis. Greece denounced the remarks.Nine days earlier, on March 2, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov had tried to reduce the tensions and find a solution. He flew to Turkey and met with Erdogan, offering to host an emergency meeting with Turkey and Greece. Erdogan refused, claiming that the EU had broken promises of aid. Bulgaria is an EU member.""The promised 6 billion euros -- they [Brussels] did not release,” Erdogan told journalists after meeting with Borisov. “Now they say they will allocate 1 billion euros. Who are you lying to?”The statement is misleading.Erdogan was referring to an agreement the EU countries made with Turkey four years ago to stop the refugee flow from Syria. The influx was causing a humanitarian crisis in Europe.The EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey, which was established in 2015 to provide additional funding to help Syrian refugees in Turkey, pledged 6 billion euros between 2016 and 2019 and required Turkey to stop the migration. The estimated 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey were to remain there until they were repatriated or resettled.Turkish government report showing the locations and numbers of Syrian refugees in the countryErdogan said Turkey kept its promises while the EU did not. But the EU funding was not promised as a direct payment to the Turkish government. Rather, it was to flow through international aid organizations and programs working directly with the refugees.Funding for these programs is ongoing and will continue through mid-2025, the EU said.The EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey states that half of the 6 billion euros comes directly from the EU budget while the rest comes from combined contributions by EU member countries.According to the EU, 2.47 billion euros were paid as scheduled during 2016-2017, and 373 million euros were directed to specific aid and development programs.The EU is behind on the 2019 schedule for the second tranche of aid and has moved the deadline to 2023. Of the promised 3 billion euros initially scheduled to be released last December, the EU disbursed 760 million.Thus, the EU paid 3.2 billion euros as of December 2019. The remaining 2.8 billion euros, according to the EU, are currently in different stages of processing.Syrian children in the refugee camp in TurkeyErdogan’s comment comparing Greek security forces to the Nazis brought a sharp rebuke from the Greek government. According to The Washington Post, Erdogan told lawmakers from his ruling AK party the following:“There is no difference with what the Nazis did and the images from the border with Greece. To open fire, fire tear gas and use boiling water on innocent people whose only aim is to save their lives and build a better future for their children is barbaric in the true meaning of the word.”Reuters quoted a Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas in response, saying of Erdogan:“He is constantly trying to torpedo the climate with such statements … We tell everyone that they shouldn’t attempt to get in through the window. There is a door. Whoever is entitled to protection should knock on that door and be entitled to protection based on international law.”Human rights groups have criticized the Greek government for its treatment of refugees trying to enter Greece from Turkey.“The inhumane measures which the Greek authorities are taking to prevent people from entering the country are an appalling betrayal of Greece’s human rights responsibilities and will put the lives of people fleeing violence at risk,” Amnesty International said in a statement released on March 2.This fact check is partially based on a report originally published by the Bulgarian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, VOA’s sister news organization.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/tensions-rise-between-turkey-and-russia-after-killing-of-troops-in-syria,https://www.polygraph.info/a/turkey-russia-syria-fact-check/30460458.html,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/05/refugees-turkey-europes-morality-is-dying-at-the-greek-border/,https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/03/bulgaria-fails-to-broker-turkey-greece-summit-on-migrants/,https://www.svobodnaevropa.bg/a/30464860.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_6694,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_6694,https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/facility_table.pdf,https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/com_2019_174_f1_communication_from_commission_to_inst_en_v5_p1_1016762.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/turkeys-erdogan-compares-greek-actions-at-border-to-nazis/2020/03/11/2e86ea1e-6389-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-turkey-eu/turkeys-erdogan-accuses-greece-of-nazi-tactics-against-migrants-at-border-idUSKBN20Y14V,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/greece-inhumane-asylum-measures-will-put-lives-at-risk/;Erdogan to Europe: ‘Who Are You Lying To?’ He’s Not Entirely Honest;;;;;;

Russia Boosting Oil Production Good For the Country, Officials Say. Except It’s Not;2020-03-11;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;On March 6, negotiations over a pact between major oil producers to limit supplies fell apart after Russia rejected a proposal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia, to respond to lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Afterward, both Saudi Arabia and Russia said they will boost oil production. OPEC removed its own limit, triggering a nearly 25 percent drop in crude oil prices on a single day – Monday, March 9 -- and a panic on global stock markets.RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo meet on the sidelines of the 2019 Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow, October 2, 2019The previous day, March 8, the Russian ruble fell by more than 9 percent, settling at 74.8 per U.S. dollar on March 9.Despite those reactions, Dmitry Kiselyov, CEO of the state-owned media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya, which includes Sputnik and RIA Novosti among others, and known as the Kremlin’s propaganda mastermind, joined a chorus of Russian officials making optimistic claims.“Don’t panic,” he wrote on Telegram that day. “Oil is falling but Russia remains in the black, not allowing its opportunities in the global oil market to be curtailed. Strategically, the decision is the right one. Had we agreed to a bad deal with OPEC (read - with the Saudis) - we would have been thrown overboard and deprived of new income. Now we have a chance not only to extract and sell as much as we need to extract and sell, but also to send American LNG overboard.”This is misleading.In addition to the immediate hit to the ruble, experts say the move will add to Russia’s chronic economic woes and hit ordinary citizens in the pocketbook.Russia -- A digital board displaying currency exchange rates in Moscow, March 8, 2020Atlantic Council senior fellow Anders Aslund told Polygraph.info: “The lower oil price will inevitably reduce Russia’s GDP (gross domestic product) , investments and standard of living, because the country will receive less imports from abroad for its exports of oil and gas, which have accounted for two-thirds of Russia’s exports when the prices have been high.“What matters to the Russian people is economic growth and their standard of living,” Aslund said.Leonid Fedun, the CEO of privately owned Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, called Russia’s exit from the pact with OPEC “irrational.” With oil prices falling to around $40 per barrel and Russia exporting about 5 million barrels a day, “Russia will be losing $100 to $150 million daily,” Fedun said.On average, Russia has been producing about 11.5 million barrels of oil a day. The independent Russian business newspaper Vedomosti, citing Energy Minister Andrey Novak, reported that the country’s oil production could increase by 500,000 barrels per day in 2020.Production increases by Saudi Arabia and Russia could lead to “real price wars” beginning in April, with prices falling below $30 a barrel, analysts told Vedomosti. In such a scenario, the Russian oil industry could only survive with substantial financial infusions from the federal budget and a significant devaluation of the ruble.The price for Brent crude oil, an industry standard, stood at more than $50 a barrel on Friday, March 6, before the OPEC talks broke down. As of midday on Wednesday, March 11, the price for Brent crude oil was $36 a barrel.Russian economists predicted falling oil prices could ignite inflation that will affect domestic prices from food to clothes and cars.Experts said the U.S. oil industry can be the biggest casualty of the Russian-Saudi standoff. Half of the U.S. shale oil producers could go bankrupt because they “have little ability to withstand lower prices,” The Wall Street Journal quoted analysts as saying.The U.S. responded to the crisis on Tuesday by suspending sales from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).Analysts at the Atlantic Council agreed in part with Kiselyov’s assertion that U.S. oil and gas industries could also suffer, but not as much as Russia’s.“The dislocations from this price war will be severe, but once again Saudi Arabia and Russia may be miscalculating if they think the pain will be worse for us than them,” said David Goldwyn, chairman of the Atlantic Council’s Energy Advisory Group.“The impact on the Russian economy is likely to be serious and lasting,” said the council’s Aslund. He compared the situation to 2008, when the price of oil fell to $32 per barrel, Russia’s stock market fell by 80 percent in dollar terms over a half a year, and the country’s GDP slumped by 8 percent.“The Russian stock market never recovered from that blow,” Aslund said. “The question remains how much suffering Russia’s poor people are prepared to take.”CHINA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) speaks with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin during the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, April 26, 2019According to Russia’s natural resources and environment ministry, oil and gas production accounted for 60 percent of Russia’s GDP in 2019.Russian officials sought to shift blame on Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-biggest oil producer after the United States.Mikhail Leontiev, press secretary of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned oil and gas giant, said the decision to boost oil production freed Russia from damaging limitations. Continuing to adhere to the pact with OPEC was “masochistic” for Russia since it was designed to clear cheap Russian oil from the market so that U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) could take its place and become a global monopoly, Leontiev said.;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-plunge-hit-by-erupting-saudi-russia-oil-price-war-idUSKBN20V131,https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2020/03/10/824757-neftyanoi-front,https://thebell.io/ya-v-legkom-shoke-sovladelets-lukojla-otsenil-poteri-rossii-ot-razvala-sdelki-s-opek-v-100-mln-v-den/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/08/russia-seen-losing-at-least-100-million-per-day-thanks-to-opec-disagreement/#73211830633b,https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2020/03/10/824808-rossiya-i-saudovskaya-araviya-soobschili,https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2020/03/10/824805-kak-virastut-tseni-iz-za-padeniya-rublya,https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-shale-drillers-could-be-casualties-of-oil-price-war-11583769768,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/saudi-arabia-and-russia-feud-over-coronavirus-oil-response-will-everyone-lose/,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/03/14/russias-natural-resources-valued-at-60-of-gdp-a64800,https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=3246422;Don’t Panic!

Kiss a Holy Tomb;2020-03-09;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Videos posted on social media showed men and boys licking the walls and doors of holy places in the Iranian city of Qom. They said they did so to prove that the city’s mosques and shrines, which draw millions of Muslim pilgrims a year, are immune to coronavirus. The videos have instantly gone viral.In one of the videos, an unidentified Iranian man films himself walking inside the shrine. “In sacred places like this, there is no room for viruses, germs or diseases,” he says looking into the camera.Masih Alinejad, a prominent Iranian journalist who tweeted the video, told Polygraph.info it was filmed in the Fatima Masumeh shrine in the city of Qom. The video is authentic she said. VOA Persian's Farhad Poulad viewed the video and agreed.Qom is some 80 miles south of Iran’s capital Tehran. The coronavirus outbreak has significantly reduced tourism in Iran, hitting Qom hard.Iran announced the country’s first COVID-19 deaths on Feb. 19. As of March 9, Iran’s official COVID-19 death toll had reached 237, and the number of people infected is nearing 8,000.Medical experts and government critics in Iran say these estimates are intentionally low and that the real figure is likely 10 times higher.Alinejad tweeted several of the videos from Qom on March 3, describing the men shown in them as “pro-regime people.” By refusing the quarantine places like Qom, she wrote, the Iranian government is endangering people both inside and outside Iran.Abdul Karim Hosseinzadeh, a member of the Iranian parliament, supported Alinejad’s call for an immediate quarantine, saying that “corpses are piling up” on the streets of Qom.""Authorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday,” Time magazine reported.""The video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man’s voice alleging all were “corona-infected.”The videos emerged after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called COVID-19 a “so-called virus” that was a scare tactic used by Iran’s enemies to prevent people from voting in Iran’s Feb. 21 parliamentary elections.Two weeks later, Khamenei’s message changed. “Don’t violate the recommendations and instructions of the responsible authorities in terms of prevention, in terms of keeping hands, face and living environment clean and not infecting these and preventing the infection of these,” he said on March 3, appearing in a video showing him planting trees in a garden.IRAN -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei uses protective gloves as he attends a tree planting ceremony in Tehran, March 3, 2020Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, said on Feb. 28 that quarantines belonged to the WWI era of “plague, cholera and stuff like that.” He said accusations that Iran was hiding the true COVID-19 statistics were baseless and that the government had “almost stabilized” the situation.Harirchi confirmed a day later that he had been quarantined after testing positive for coronavirus.On March 3, Iranian authorities said two men shown in videos licking shrines in Qom had ignored government recommendations and could be jailed and flogged.Iran’s government also banned prayers on Friday, the one day of the week that Muslims are obliged to pray in a mosque.COVID-19’s march through Iran has been accompanied by numerous claims of false cures and a government-backed disinformation campaign labeling the virus as part of a U.S. ""psychological warfare operation"" against China and Iran.Virus Outbreak Mideast Iran -- Relatives mourn over the body of Fatemeh Rahbar, a lawmaker-elect from a Tehran constituency, who died on Saturday after being infected with the new coronavirus, at Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, just outside Tehran, Iran, Sunday";https://youtu.be/108N7FW4QKE,https://twitter.com/AlinejadMasih/status/1233783635007954949?s=20,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/02/coronavirus-a-coup-de-grace-on-irans-troubled-tourism.html,https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/opinion/coronavirus-iran.html,https://iranwire.com/en/features/6750,https://twitter.com/AlinejadMasih/status/1233783635007954949?s=20,https://iranwire.com/en/special-features/6789,https://time.com/5796035/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-iran-islam-mecca/,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/iran-khamenei-optimistic-coronavirus-covid-19-death-toll.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/wash-your-hands-irans-khamenei-says-as-coronavirus-toll-rises-idUSKBN20Q19Q,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-iran-became-a-new-epicenter-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-51706021,https://time.com/5796035/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-iran-islam-mecca/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51677530,http://www.iran-daily.com/News/266577.html;Iran’s Immunity from the Coronavirus?

281;;;;Likely false;VeteransToday.com;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/iran-russia-cia-afghanistan-fact-check/6742309.html;Unsupported Claims that CIA’s Iran Chief Died in Afghan Crash;2020-02-04;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"After a U.S. military plane crashed in Taliban-controlled territory in Afghanistan on Jan. 27, several Russia and Iran-linked web sites claimed the Taliban had shot down the plane.A YouTube video describes the E11-A communications plane.These sites also claimed that the CIA official in charge of the U.S. operation that killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), died in the crash. They reported the CIA officer’s body was taken by the militants, along with a stash of top secret CIA documents. They identified the “dead” official as “Mike de Andrea,” misspelling the name of Michael D’Andrea, chief of the CIA’s Iran Mission Center.One of the sites, VeteransToday.com, wrote: “It has been reported that Mike de Andrea [sic] responsible for the assassination of the martyr Major General Qassem Soleimani was killed in the accident of the American plane that was shot down in Afghanistan. He is the most prominent figure of the CIA intelligence in the region.”While Iranian media cited sources in the Taliban in their stories about the incident, VeteransToday.com said its report about D’Andrea’s death in Afghanistan was “original” and confirmed by “Russian intelligence sources.”This version of events surrounding the crash gradually made its way to the British newspapers the Daily Mail and The Independent, but other media, including Time magazine, called it “disinformation.”Indeed, it is likely false.The CrashAfghan, NATO and U.S. officials said the plane, identified as a U.S. Air Force Bombardier E-11A electronic surveillance aircraft, was not shot down, but crashed.Several media reports citing interviews with witnesses support that scenario.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that residents near where the aircraft crashed in Afghanistan’s Ghazni Province said they did not believe claims that militants had shot down the plane. One witness told RFE/RL he watched a plane “rotating in the air as it fell down.”A witness told Al Jazeera that the plane was heading from the location of Gazhni city “towards this place” and suddenly “began flying a little lower” for no apparent reason, after which it “crash-landed.”None of the witnesses mentioned seeing or hearing blasts while the plane was aloft. Likewise, there were no reports that the plane was on fire before it crashed.The Pentagon said the incident remains under investigation but there were no indications the plane crashed as a result a “hostile action.” It said “only two people” were aboard, both of whom died.A local journalist told the Associated Press he saw “two bodies” near the “badly burned” plane.On Jan. 27, a U.S. defense official said the bodies of the two American service members were recovered. The bodies were ""treated with dignity and respect by the local Afghan community, in accordance with their culture,"" the Pentagon said.A U.S recovery team “met no Taliban resistance in reaching the site,” the official said, adding that there were “no indications the plane was downed by a hostile action.” The recovery team “secured” the flight data recorder and destroyed the remaining wreckage.On Jan. 28, the U.S. Defense Department identified the two officers killed in the E-11A crash as Lt. Col. Paul K. Voss, 46, and Capt. Ryan S. Phaneuf, 30.Asked about reports of D’Andrea’s “death” in the crash, the U.S. Defense Department told Polygraph.info: “There were only two people on the E-11A aircraft that crashed in Afghanistan on January 27. They were the two U.S. Air Force officers identified by the Defense Department on January 29.""Why Michael D’Andrea?Business Insider reported on Jan. 28 that Iranian state TV “spread a wild theory” claiming that a senior CIA official killed in the E-11A crash had been behind the killing of Soleimani. Multiple Iranian and Russian media outlets picked up the story.There was a red flag in the Iranian reports.To identify D’Andrea, Iran’s state TV used a screenshot from the Hollywood movie “Zero Dark Thirty,” about the U.S. operation to kill Osama bin Laden in May 2012. The screenshot was a photo of Frederic Lehne, the actor who played “The Wolf,” a top CIA official in the film whose character was reportedly based on D’Andrea.In 2012, the Washington Post published a profile of the chief of the CIA’s Counter terrorism Center, identifying him only by his code name “Rodger.”Three years later, in April 2015, the New York Times identified him as Michael D’Andrea.According to more recent reports, D’Andrea was appointed head of the CIA’s Iran desk in 2017 by the agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo. There has been no confirmation that D’Andrea oversaw or was involved in the operation that killed Soleimani.Former CIA Officers Dispute the ScenarioAnalysts have disputed the claim that D’Andrea died in the E-11A crash.“This is pure propaganda,” John Sipher, a former senior official in the CIA’s National Clandestine Service, told Polygraph.info. “Obviously, I do not know for certain, but I would bet my home that it is totally false.”Sipher, who runs Spycraft Entertainment, a firm consulting movie directors and authors, added: “Unlike in the movies, senior CIA officers do not rush into the field to handle issues. Nor do they often fly in military planes.”One of the few articles to question the U.S. official account of crash was written by Philip Giraldi, a former CIA counter-terrorism specialist, and published in the American Herald Tribune.Giraldi’s analysis, however, contains information that’s been challenged, including the claims that hostile fire prevented the U.S. recovery team from getting to the crash site and that the Pentagon never revealed how many people were aboard.Media Metrics website, which rates news organization bias, described the American Herald Tribune as a “conservative-pseudoscience” website; a CNN investigation suggested the site “originates in Iran.”The CIA did not respond to Polygraph.info inquiry about D’Andrea.";https://www.airforcemag.com/e-11a-reportedly-crashes-in-afghanistan/,https://southfront.org/top-cia-officer-behind-soleimani-assassination-died-in-e-11a-crash-in-afghanistan-media,https://www.veteranstoday.com/2020/01/29/vt-had-it-first-pentagons-top-spy-plane-downed-by-taliban-crypto-gear-docs-captured-warning-unpleasant-photos/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/trump-soleimani-strike-russia/30359204.html,http://time.com/5775758/military-crash-cia-disinformation/,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/plane-crashes-afghanistan-killing-everyone-board-afghan-official-says-n1123661,https://www.rferl.org/a/afghan-residents-doubt-taliban-shot-down-u-s-aircraft/30401828.html,https://youtu.be/SF74qR_n9K4,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/28/official-remains-2-us-troops-recovered-afghan-crash-site.html,https://apnews.com/1359ef15991e0e49287eb798bfec0266,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/29/pentagon-ids-2-airmen-killed-afghanistan-crash.html,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/29/pentagon-ids-2-airmen-killed-afghanistan-crash.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-image-zero-dark-thirty-actor-claim-cia-agent-death-2020-1,https://ew.com/article/2012/11/20/zero-dark-thirty-interview-bigelow-boal/,https://slate.com/culture/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-fact-vs-fiction-who-are-the-real-life-inspirations-for-the-characters-in-the-oscar-nominated-film.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/at-cia-a-convert-to-islam-leads-the-terrorism-hunt/2012/03/23/gIQA2mSqYS_story.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/us/politics/deep-support-in-washington-for-cias-drone-missions.html,https://www.newsweek.com/cia-iran-chief-michael-dandrea-osama-bin-laden-619912,https://ahtribune.com/us/3857-michael-dandrea.html,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-herald-tribune/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/tech/iran-info-ops/index.html;Unsupported Claims that CIA’s Iran Chief Died in Afghan Crash;;;;;;

The circumstances around Issachar’s arrest are more complex, and the Russians had offered her up in an earlier prison swap.ISRAEL -- Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Yaffa Issachar, mother of Naama Issachar who is jailed in Russia on drug charges, and officials attend a meeting in Jerusalem, January 23, 2020The arrestIssachar, now 27, was taken into custody last April in the Moscow Sheremetyevo airport. She was in transit from India to Israel when the Russian police said they found about 9.6 grams of marijuana in luggage she checked when registering for her flight in New Delhi.Authorities charged Issachar with carrying contraband narcotics. Issachar denied the charges, saying she had no access to her luggage and had no idea how cannabis got into her bag. She also argued that she had no intention of entering Russia during her brief layover at the Moscow airport. Nonetheless, a Moscow court in October sentenced her to 7.5 years in prison; in December an appeals court upheld the sentence.The defenseAs it turns out, Putin’s assertion that it was “very good” Issachar didn’t cross the Russian border echoed the very arguments used by her defense.A Sheremetyevo customs officer testified in the court in October as a defense witness and said Issachar’s luggage “did not cross the customs border and her actions did not constitute the crime of contraband.” Airport authorities also sent a written statement to the court saying transit luggage is not a subject of a customs security search. In October and again in December, however, the court rejected those arguments as an “attempt to escape justice” by Issachar.Issachar’s family said then the sentencing was “ludicrous.”A public campaign was launched to free the New Jersey-born woman from Russian confinement. Netanyahu rallied to her cause.The hackerLast October, the Russian and Israeli news agencies reported that Russia offered to exchange Issachar for the Russian hacker Alexei Burkov, who at the time was being held in Israel and was wanted for extradition by the U.S.Tel-Aviv refused the deal, and Burkov was extradited to the U.S.On Jan. 23 in Virginia, Burkov pleaded guilty to “access device fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, identity theft, wire and access device fraud, and money laundering, and faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison when sentenced on May 8.”The cyber security news site Krebsonsecurity.com said, Burkov was “an asset of supreme importance” to Moscow and had run highly sophisticated secretive forums for “elite” hackers.ISRAEL -- Russian citizen Aleksei Burkov (2nd R seated), suspected of hacking-related crimes, attends court a hearing in Jerusalem, November 3, 2019But failure of the prisoner swap did not discourage Russia. Instead, the focus shifted to transfer of ownership of a building, the Alexander Courtyard in Jerusalem’s Old City, to the Russian Orthodox Church. Russia had been seeking the property for more than a decade, The Times of Israel reported.For Netanyahu, currently facing corruption charges and elections in March, freeing an Israeli woman whose predicament had moved millions is politically beneficial, the paper said.Issachar was released as Netanyahu headed to Moscow for a meeting with Putin about a U.S. peace plan for the Middle East.“The announcement Tuesday by the Prime Minister’s Office of the trip to Russia came less than an hour after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit filed an indictment against Netanyahu for charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust with the Jerusalem District Court,” The Times of Israel report on Issachar said.";https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-israel-issachar-idUSKBN1ZT0HH,http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62698,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/middleeast/naama-issachar-russia-israel-intl/index.html,https://ria.ru/20191219/1562608777.htm,https://ria.ru/20191219/1562608777.html,https://youtu.be/-Tsvsf2ogIE,https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-wants-russia-to-free-us-israeli-woman-rules-out-swap-2019-10,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-russian-hacker-held-in-israel-calls-for-swap-deal-with-israeli-held-in-russia-1.7971105,http://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-steps-up-efforts-to-shield-its-hackers-from-extradition-to-u-s-11572949802,https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/russian-national-pleads-guilty-running-online-criminal-marketplace,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/russian-cybercrime-boss-burkov-pleads-guilty/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-israel-issachar-idUSKBN1ZT0HH,https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/1579700965-reports-russia-expects-more-israeli-gestures-for-release-of-naama-issachar,http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/274941,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-american-backpacker-naama-issachar-freed-from-russian-prison-reports/;A Flip-Flop for Putin in Israeli-American’s Pardon;;;;;;

Some Russian media reports suggested U.S. bioterrorism. “The expert saw signs of the American bioterrorism in spreading of the coronavirus,” Moskovsky Komsomelets newspaper reported.The story featured Igor Nikulin, a Russian biochemical and military expert and former adviser to the United Nations commission on biological and chemical weapons.Nikulin was the same scientist who claimed the United States, not Russia, was behind the March 2018 poisoning, using a military grade nerve agent, of the ex-KGB spy Sergey Skripal and his daughter in the U.K.(Amid Moscow’s denials, a U.K. investigation determined that Russian military intelligence was behind the Skirpal poisoning.)Russia’s oldest state-owned news agency, RIA Novosti, reported, “The spread of coronavirus might have been a sabotage, the expert [Nikulin] thinks.”The RIA Novosti report, citing Nikulin, speculated that U.S. diplomatic staff may have “delivered” the dangerous cargo from the “American lab” to Wuhan.Others joined in.Leonid Savin, featured as a foreign policy expert at the shadowy Strategic Culture Foundation, speculated that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation may have helped finance creation of the “coronavirus bioweapon.”Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and a popular veteran politician, told Moscow radio that Americans were “surely” behind the outbreak. He suggested pharmacists were gaining billions while the U.S. military reaped an “opportunity to test” weaponizing the virus.A Screenshot of Russian Media Reports Promoting U.S. Coronavirus ConspiracyThe Russian media reports appeared to be part of a domestic disinformation campaign. The coronavirus conspiracies did not appear in the Kremlin’s foreign language news agencies. Anti-U.S. conspiracies are common in Russia. They include a thoroughly refuted story about the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory, known as the “Lugar lab,” in Georgia, the former Soviet republic.Russian sources claimed the Pentagon was using the lab to create and test biological weapons, causing hundreds of deaths in the local population.That conspiracy was proven completely fabricated by multiple investigations and fact checks, including by Polygraph.info. In reality, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the drug company Gilead were working a joint project with Georgian health officials to combat hepatitis C using antiviral medicines.Other discredited conspiracy theories circulated by Russian media claimed the U.S. created the Ebola virus as a biological weapon and tried to infect Latin American leaders with a deadly cancer virus.;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200127-sitrep-7-2019--ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=98ef79f5_2,https://ren.tv/news/v-mire/653042-mutatsiia-tainaia-laboratoriia-ili-provokatsiia-otkuda-prishel-koronavirus,https://www.kp.ru/daily/27083.7/4154508/,http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/emergencies/pages/news/news/2020/01/2019-ncov-outbreak-first-cases-confirmed-in-europe,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-01-26/coronavirus-latest-behind-the-race-to-contain-china-s-killer-bug,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2020/01/f/f5/f5afd721-7935-4b82-9579-d5ffffcb8e94_mobile.mp4,/a/russia-coronavirus-conspiracy-fact-check/6741104.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741104.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741104.html&text=Russian+Media+Spew+U.S.+Coronavirus+Conspiracies+for+Domestic+Audience,/a/6741104.html,/embed/player/Article/6741104.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html,https://www.mk.ru/science/2020/01/27/ekspert-uvidel-priznaki-amerikanskogo-bioterrorizma-v-rasprostranenii-koronavirusa.html,https://accesswdun.com/article/2018/3/648202,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=Novichok&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10,https://ria.ru/20200127/1563927253.html,https://www.fondsk.ru/authors/leonid-savin-33.html,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/strategic-culture-foundation/,https://www.fondsk.ru/news/2020/01/27/otkuda-vzjalsja-etot-koronavirus-49985.html?print,https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2020/01/27/n_13965710.shtml?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-georgia-lugar-lab-russia/29507458.html,https://politinform.su/5390-nuzhno-rassledovat-deyatelnost-cru-v-otnoshenii-proishozhdeniya-eboly-v-zaire-press-tv-iran.html,http://www.politonline.ru/provocation/17106.html,https://newsland.com/community/5903/content/ebola-ot-ssha-sekretnye-laboratorii-tsru-i-voennykh-vedomstv-ssha/3024163;Russian Media Spew U.S. Coronavirus Conspiracies for Domestic Audience;;;;;;
284;;;;False;Elena Panina;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/trump-soleimani-strike-russia/6742295.html;Russian Lawmaker: ‘Trump Did Not Understand the Significance of Soleimani’;2020-01-03;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"The killing of Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in a U.S. airstrike, sparked controversy worldwide, with some praising the move as necessary and others warning it could backfire. Domestically, the targeted killing in Iraq raised concerns about the U.S. president’s legal authority to make such decisions. The Pentagon said in a statement: ""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region."" In an interview with CNN, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strike had disrupted an “imminent” attack. Soleimani, he said, was “actively plotting in the region to take actions — a big action, as he described it — that would have put dozens, if not hundreds, of American lives at risk."" Soleimani was on a U.N. travel sanctions list and had been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2005 as a supporter of terrorism. Russia’s Foreign Ministry condemned the U.S. strike as an “adventurous” move that “will lead to increased tension throughout the region.” Expressing “sincere condolences to the Iranian people,” the ministry said Soleimani “loyally served the cause of protecting Iran's national interests.” In 2016, Soleimani met President Vladimir Putin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow to discuss a Syrian military offensive against anti-government insurgents. The Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Elena Panina, a member of the foreign affairs committee of the State Duma (the lower house of Russia’s parliament), as suggesting that the President Donald Trump may have been ignorant of Soleimani’s significance in Iran when ordering the strike to kill him. She suggested that Trump was tricked. ""In this situation, we cannot exclude that the American military and intelligence agencies took advantage of the story of the disturbances near the U.S. Embassy in Iraq in their corporate interests and simply framed Donald Trump, who did not fully understand the significance of the figure of Qassem Soleimani, who has the status of a national hero in Iran."" Panina claimed Soleimani’s killing was in revenge for a series of “humiliating” blows the U.S. suffered at the hands of the Iranian military. In particular, she cited what she called the “successful simulation of the destruction"" of the USS Essex, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, in the Persian Gulf while the head of the U.S. Central Command, U.S. Gen. Joseph Votel, was on board. That incident took place in October 2018, when two Iranian small patrol boats approached the U.S. ship during an exercise. Contrary to Panina’s claim, there was nothing humiliating for the U.S. Navy in that encounter. In fact, Gen. Votel was quoted as responding to the situation with humor, and the U.S. Navy command said the Iranian boats acted safely and professionally. In addition, what Panina described as “disturbances near the U.S. Embassy in Iraq” were in reality a two-day standoff that began with Iranian-backed militiamen and their supporters attacking the embassy compound, wrecking a reception area, setting several fires and writing graffiti as they protested U.S. airstrikes on an Iran-backed militia group. The embassy attack prompted the State Department to evacuate diplomatic personnel, the Pentagon to deploy additional troops to Iraq and Trump to lash out at Iran, saying: “They (Iran) will pay a big price. This is not a warning. It is a threat.” Panina’s claim that, at the time he ordered the strike, Trump was possibly ignorant of Soleimani’s significance, is false. According to U.S. media reports, Trump's decision to allow the U.S. military to kill Soleimani was well-informed and based on weeks of consultations. Additionally, the issue of Soleimani had already caused major criticism of Trump’s candidacy during his run for the White House. In September 2015, then-candidate Trump was unable to respond to a question from radio host Hugh Hewitt about Soleimani. At the time, Trump’s ignorance of Soleimani made the then-candidate a target of criticism both by his political rivals and the press. Soleimani had a decades-long record as a major U.S. security threat, and there were repeated calls for his elimination. Pompeo told CNN that before taking the move to kill Soleimani, Trump had “shown enormous restraint,” while intelligence had been collected on “Soleimani’s travels in the region and the work that he was doing to put Americans further at risk.”  “The risk of doing nothing was enormous,” Pompeo said. President Trump said on Friday that he authorized a precision strike against Soleimani because he was plotting “imminent and sinister attacks” on Americans.";https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/more-dangerous-world-iran-killing-triggers-global-alarm,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/what-is-trumps-legal-authority-for-soleimani-assassination.html,https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/us-kills-commander-irans-elite-quds-force,https://www.voanews.com/europe/russia-condemns-us-killing-iranian-commander,https://tass.ru/politika/7461237,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-soleimani-insigh/how-iranian-general-plotted-out-syrian-assault-in-moscow-idUSKCN0S02BV20151006,https://ria.ru/20200103/1563095455.html,https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/10/26/two-iranian-fast-boats-approach-us-warship-while-centcom-commander-on-board/,https://apnews.com/91686dba003b4af69a120272baaafece,https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/iranian-backed-protesters-withdraw-us-embassy-compound-baghdad,http://www.voanews.com/middle-east/trump-threatens-iran-does-not-see-war-after-baghdad-embassy-attack,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/03/donald-trump-iran-soleimani-093371,http://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/03/donald-trump-iran-soleimani-093371,https://youtu.be/X9puLBIX48M,https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-qassem-suleimani-20150904-story.html,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander,http://www.voanews.com/middle-east/soleimani-general-who-became-iran-icon-targeting-us,https://www.voanews.com/usa/trump-says-killing-irans-quds-force-commander-overdue;Russian Lawmaker: ‘Trump Did Not Understand the Significance of Soleimani’;;;;;;
285;;;;Misleading;Vladimir Putin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-hypersonic-russia/6742293.html;Putin Claims Russian Dominion in Hypersonic Weapons Technology;2019-12-30;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;Speaking to the Russian Defense Ministry’s annual board meeting at the National Defense Center in Moscow on Dec. 24, President Vladimir Putin praised Russia for having developed an entirely new class of weapons.Addressing the board members, Soviet style, as “respected comrades,” Putin said that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was “always” behind the United States in developing weapons.“Today we have a situation that is unique in modern history: they have to catch up to us,” Putin declared. “Not a single country in the world has hypersonic weapons, let alone hypersonic weapons of intercontinental range.”That claim is misleading, and the key to deciphering it is in the details.Firstly, how is “hypersonic” defined? The universally accepted definition of “hypersonic” is anything traveling at Mach 5 (five times of a speed of sound) or faster. According to Putin, Russia’s hypersonic missiles can fly “27 times faster than the speed of sound.”If speed were the only factor in determining whether a weapon should be labelled hypersonic, then the U.S. LGM-30 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, which reaches a speed of Mach 23, would qualify. The first version of the Minuteman system was deployed in the early 1960s, and the nuclear-tipped missile has been regularly modernized.While not described as “hypersonic,” the speed of the LGM-30 Minuteman III nearly matches that of Russia’s Kinzhal, Avangard and Tsircon hypersonic delivery systems.If the U.S. had a hypersonic intercontinental ballistic missile well before Russia, why is Putin claiming that only Russia has such weapons? “The LGM-30 Minuteman III is the launcher vehicle for the weapon, in this case the RV (re-entry vehicle, carrying the nuclear warheads). It [the Minuteman] does in fact fly at hypersonic speeds but it’s a different class of weapon system,” George Nacouzi, a senior engineer with the at the RAND Corporation’s Project Air Force, told Polygraph.info.That raises a second question: what types of hypersonic weapons are known to be under development? There are two -- hypersonic cruise missiles, which can fly at altitudes up to 100,000 feet, and hypersonic glide vehicles, which can fly above 100,000 feet. A glide vehicle is placed atop a rocket, from which it is launched and then glides on top of the atmosphere.“The hypersonic weapons being discussed by Putin and others are Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) and some are hypersonic cruise missiles (HCM). Unlike an RV, which flies ballistically (like a baseball flying through the air), an HGV flies more like a glider on top of the atmosphere. It’s a completely different trajectory and the HGV is maneuverable so it’s much more difficult to defend against,” Nacouzi explained.Nacouzi noted that China may have an “operational” hypersonic missile with a range of 1,800-2,500 kilometers, which is classified a medium range missile, compared to the intercontinental (5,500 km) missile Putin claimed Russia has developed.“We don’t know what its status is,” he said. “However, given that they displayed several of them, the message they seem to be sending is that they do have an operational hypersonic missile. Open sources indicate that the DF-17 has a range between 1800-2500 km.”While Russia and China are the first nations to have announced the operational deployment of hypersonic weapons systems, other nations have had hypersonic programs for decades, and some of those have successfully tested these weapons as early as in 2011.The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported in September 2019 that at least seven countries have been developing hypersonic weapons technology for over a decade. These include the United States, Russia, China, Australia, India, France and Germany.Titled “Hypersonic Weapons: Background and Issues for Congress” the CRS report detailed open source information about the U.S. and other nation’s programs to develop these weapons.“Some of the systems described in the report are similar to the ones Putin is referring to,” Nacouzi said. “However, it’s not clear how far along the US intercontinental range hypersonic weapon is. So the types of weapons are the same, i.e., hypersonic glide vehicles, but Putin claims that Russia has an intercontinental range class and it’s not clear what the status of the US version is.” Much depends on whether the nations developing this class of weapons arm them with nuclear warheads. As described in “Global Hypersonic Missiles Market 2017-2021,” a report conducted by the Ireland-based Research and Markets group, arming such missiles with nuclear warheads could have a devastating effect.“Hypersonic missiles, when fitted with nuclear warheads, can be fatal to the target enemy country,” the report stated. “It can also cause nuclear winter that could last for a very long time after the initial attack and eventually leave the area inhabitable.”According to the Sept. 2019 CRS report and other open source data, the U.S. has invested in research and development for a hypersonic missile called the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW), which uses boost glide technology to propel warheads with conventional, rather than nuclear payloads.Nacouzi said, this program presents the U.S. with additional challenges.”The US intercontinental version is more challenging since it will need to have much higher accuracy due to its conventional system, as opposed to the Russian system, which has a nuclear payload so [it] doesn’t need the same level of accuracy,” he said.In 2011, the U.S. successfully tested an AHW to try and determine its capabilities for atmospheric flight over long ranges.The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DAPRA) Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) achieved a speed of Mach 20 in August 2011. The U.S. Air Force successfully tested a hypersonic AGM-183A Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, in June 2019.“Putin may be right in saying that no one has a hypersonic glide vehicle of intercontinental range, but [it is] not true that no one has a hypersonic weapon,” Nacouzi said.;https://apnews.com/d4e05956217d895594bcef491083e950,https://www.military.com/equipment/lgm-30-minuteman-iii,https://media.nti.org/documents/NTI-Hruby_FINAL.PDF,https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/missile-basics/hypersonic-missiles/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-army-hypersonic/china-leads-u-s-on-potent-super-fast-missiles-idUSKCN1S11E6,http://thediplomat.com/2017/12/introducing-the-df-17-chinas-newly-tested-ballistic-missile-armed-with-a-hypersonic-glide-vehicle/,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf,https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4332752/global-hypersonic-missiles-market-2017-2021#rela4-4763817,https://www.army-technology.com/projects/advanced-hypersonic-weapon-ahw/,https://www.darpa.mil/program/falcon-htv-2,https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1874470/air-force-conducts-successful-hypersonic-weapon-flight-test/;Putin Claims Russian Dominion in Hypersonic Weapons Technology;;;;;;

It was bylined with the name of a prominent defense reporter and distributed via email, ostensibly by the same journalist.The news reportThe “news item” reported that “on December 12 at about 3.40 pm two unidentified men approached a BMW 320, got in the car, threatened the driver with a knife, struck him in the face and tried to seize him. When the driver called for help, the attackers disappeared.”The report claimed two U.S. Army sergeants had been identified on CCTV camera footage of the carjacking and detained. It named the two sergeants as “Sgt Gomez and Sgt Ortiz” and claimed they belonged to the “1st Battalion, 9th US Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, deployed in Lithuania.”The Vilnius police noted in a Dec. 12 press release that an attempted carjacking had indeed taken place.The law enforcement officials named in the news report -- Saulius Gagas, chief of Vilnius County police, and Lithuania's Prosecutor General Evaldas Pasilis -- are also real. So is the reporter named in the byline – Vaidas Saldžiūnas, defense editor for DELFI, a leading Baltic media portal. He is also one of Lithuania’s prominent investigative journalists and involved in Debunk.eu, a European Union program that debunks fake news and disinformation, mainly coming out of Russia.Moreover, the report accurately identified the U.S. Army unit deployed in Lithuania under NATO auspices.Given that the report contained a lot of correct information, it appeared authentic. It ended with a reference to the 2017 agreement between the U.S. and Lithuania regulating the status of the American troops there, which gives the U.S. judicial authority to prosecute crimes committed by its troops on Lithuanian territory.“Thus, U.S. soldiers once again will not be punished for their crimes,” the report concluded, implying that this was not the first such incident and that none of the perpetrators in “previous” ones had been brought to justice.The cyber-attackApart from the real information – that a carjacking had taken place, the names of Lithuanian officials and a real U.S. Army unit that has members deployed in Lithuania – a Polygraph.info fact-check found that everything else in the report was fabricated. That includes the quotes by the law enforcement officials and the identities of the U.S. troops allegedly involved, as well as their alleged detention.“It was an information cyber-attack against U.S. soldiers. So far the attack had only limited outreach and was printed in a few Lithuanian news websites,” Kęstutis Vaskelevicius, a representative of the Lithuanian Embassy in Washington, D.C. told Polygraph.info.The U.S. Army-Europe told VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin that it is ""aware of the reports in the press concerning two U.S. soldiers being arrested in Lithuania.”“We can confirm that the reports are false,” U.S. Army-Europe said.DELFI issued a statement debunking the report as a cyber-attack, and the Baltic Times removed it from its website. The fake report is still available on a cached page, as seen in the screenshot below. A screenshot of a fake news report planted on the Baltic Times website in a cyber-attackVaidas Saldžiūnas, the DELFI reporter whose name was used in the byline of a fake report on the carjacking, confirmed the report was fabricated and said it was not the first time he was targeted in a cyber-attack.“It's the second time this happened in my name,” Saldžiūnas told Polygraph.info. “[The] (f)irst case [was] in October about alleged US nukes in Lithuania. Those behind [it] used my name and spoofed email sent to targeted recipients in Lithuania.”Saldžiūnas shared this screenshot of the earlier hoax email:A screenshot of a fake press release by the Lithuanian Foreign MinistryThat earlier cyber-attack involved the distribution of a fake Lithuanian Foreign Ministry press release asking the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons to Lithuania, as well as a fake response from the U.S. State Department thanking Lithuanian leadership for the “offer.” (see the screenshot below)A screenshot of a fake U.S. Department of State pres release regarding Lithuania“This time the audience was targeted more broadly - went to other media as well as abroad,” Saldžiūnas said.To execute the operation, the hackers created a fake persona on the website LiveLeak a few days prior the cyber-attack. A fake name was used along with Saldžiūnas’s real name to distribute the report via a hoax email and an another website.Who was behind the cyber-attack?In Lithuania, investigations of cyber-attacks fall under the jurisdiction of several state entities, Saldžiūnas said.The National Cyber Security Center of Lithuania is tasked with investigating the technical aspects, while the Strategic Communication units of the country’s Defense and Foreign ministries take on the disinformation angle, producing their own assessment of the nature of the attack.“Both institutions rarely share evidence directly specifying who's behind it. This time they say they're ‘working hard on it’,” Saldžiūnas said.However, there are “some clues” about hackers, Saldžiūnas said, “like sloppy English and Lithuanian.”“I've been writing on both military deployments and debunking fake stories for years, so I believe it was just a matter of time before I became a target,” Saldžiūnas said, adding: “My bet would be on local proxies, perhaps on a payroll. The anti-American, anti-NATO, pro-Kremlin narrative correlation is uncanny.”NATO -- and specifically the U.S. -- troops in the Baltics have long been the targets of the Russian disinformation, including cyber operations. Besides the fake “request to deploy nuclear weapons” in Lithuania cited above, among the most reported cases was a fake story about a U.S. military vehicle accidentally killing a local boy and getting away with the crime.";https://www.baltictimes.com/,http://vilnius.policija.lrv.lt/suvestines/2019-12-12-ivykiu-suvestine,https://www.dvidshub.net/image/5991004/nfiu-lithuania-nato-day?fbclid=IwAR0eogbpfY1tk-PZ7qFuS2jLxjQZo7EomFczGfMq7aoNoJjhyzUpJYEmY1E,https://www.demaskuok.lt/,https://en.delfi.lt/politics/hackers-fake-press-release-about-lithuania-asking-us-to-move-nuclear-weapons.d?id=82566327,https://www.urm.lt/default/en/news/lithuanian-foreign-ministrys-statement-on-fake-news,https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=k9zAZ_1576761100,https://justinasantanaitis.wixsite.com/website/home/jav-kariai-%C4%AFtariami-bandymu-pagrobti-automobil%C4%AF-vilniuje,https://www.nksc.lt/en/,https://www.businessinsider.com/r-lithuania-sees-fake-news-attempt-to-discredit-nato-exercises-2018-6;U.S. Army Sergeants Arrested for Carjacking a BMW in Lithuania?;;;;;;

Russian athletes not found to have been doping can participate in any international sports events, including the Olympic Games, except that they may not compete under the Russian flag.According to WADA: “Russian athletes and their support personnel may only participate in Major Events staged in the Four-Year Period where they are able to demonstrate that they are not implicated in any way by the non-compliance with conditions including (without limitation) that they are not mentioned in incriminating circumstances in the McLaren (a WADA investigator) reports, there are no positive findings reported for them in the database and no data relating to their samples has been manipulated, and that they have been subject to adequate in-competition and out-of-competition testing prior to the event in question according to WADA … In this circumstance, they may not represent the Russian Federation,” WADA document said.WADA said that in dealing with Russia, it followed the standard procedure and that over the course of an investigation lasting years it had obtained material evidence of a Russian government athletic doping scheme.“For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport,” said WADA President Craig Reedie. “Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial. As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts.”In 2015, WADA had suspended Russia from participating in major world sports events as a nation. In the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag.For years, top Russian diplomats, government officials, the Kremlin and Putin have denied that Russian athletes were doping. Polygraph.info examined and debunked many of these claims.In announcing the latest ban, WADA said Russia falsified, altered and deleted data from the Moscow laboratory that tested for banned substances.The 2020 Summer Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo in July and August.;https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-12/wada-executive-committee-unanimously-endorses-four-year-period-of-non-compliance,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191209/1562155429.html,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191209/1562162589.html,https://rsport.ria.ru/reshenie-wada-po-otstraneniyu-rossii-ot-sorevnovaniy/,https://tass.ru/obschestvo/7300721,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191209/1562162983.html,https://www.instagram.com/p/B52TaZMIrFn/?igshid=196i13ec2jset,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control-process/mclaren-independent-investigation-report-part-i,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-12/wada-executive-committee-unanimously-endorses-four-year-period-of-non-compliance,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-07/wada-statement-independent-investigation-confirms-russian-state-manipulation-of,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-wada-olympic-ban-doping/30295009.html,https://www.polygraph.info/s?k=doping&tab=all&pi=1&r=any&pp=10;Russia's Response to Olympic Ban: 'Chronic Anti-Russian Hysteria';;;;;;

[O]bservers believe this is a clear signal that the protests in Hong Kong will be maximally radicalized.”--“Joshua Wong confirmed this assumption, shouting furious slogans into the microphone and literally choking with hatred: ‘Glory To Hong Kong! Glory to the heroes of Hong Kong! We hate the police! Don't obey the police! Liberate Hong Kong!’ The crowd shouted back: ’USA!’.”--“Then everyone watched a video prepared by the organizers of the action. The video encouraged [them] not to stop there, but to continue the fight. Various white American uncles and aunts performed, and, against touching background music, spoke about the support of the ‘people of Hong Kong.’ In the frame appeared different faces from among American politicians and officials. All of them talked about how you must not stop, you need to protest as much as possible, and that only by force is it possible to satisfy the demands of the opposition.”What actually happened During the rally that took place at Hong Kong’s Edinburgh Place on Nov. 28 – Thanksgiving Day in the United States -- protesters celebrated the fact that U.S. President Donald Trump had signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law.While reporting that rally participants chanted “USA!”, RIAFAN.ru did not mention that the main reason they had gathered was to celebrate the new U.S. law supporting their democratic aspirations.According to Hong Kong police, some 9,600 people attended the rally, not the 2,000-2,500 reported by RIAFAN.ru. Rally organizers claimed 100,000 people participated.Whatever the case, photographs from the rally posted by Twitter users during the event suggested attendance was much higher than the numbers reported by RIAFAN.ruThe statue erected on the staircase, described by RIAFAN.ru in racist terms, is difficult to identify from the low-resolution photo embedded in the news agency’s report.A screenshot of RIAFAN report on Hong Kong Thanksgiving Rally Nov. 28, 2019 with a statue installationHowever, the statue of an African American man standing behind a rostrum with what appears to be an open Bible in his right hand as part of an exhibit symbolizing American democracy appears to depict Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech. Online reverse image searches also support this conclusion.“This is fake news,” Hong Kong opposition activist Joshua Wang told Polygraph.info in response to a request for comment on the RIAFAN.ru report. “I have never said ‘Glory to Hong Kong! Glory to the Heroes of Hong Kong! Hate to police! Disobedience to police! Free Hong Kong!’ during the assembly,” Wang said, referring to a live feed video on his Facebook page confirming that RIAFAN.ru fabricated the quote it attributed to him.In its own video report, RIAFAN.ru included parts of what it described as a video clip in which “various white American uncles and aunts” tried convince the protesters that “only by force” they can achieve their goals.In its edited video report, RIAFAN showed fragments of videos apparently shot from the screen with three persons speaking English, with subtitles in Russian but no identification of the speakers.RIAFAN showed fragments of videos apparently shot from the screen with three persons speaking English, with subtitles in Russian but no identification of the speakers.Using reverse image search tools Polygraph.info was able to identify the people on the video as (left to right):Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Senator, R-Tennessee;William Devlin, American pastor;Solomon Yue Jr., U.S. political activist of Chinese descent, a member of the Republican [Party’s ] National Committee from the state of Oregon.The original video recordings of all three expressing support for Hong Kong’s protesters are available online.Blackburn posted the video on her official Twitter feed.Devin confirmed that he addressed the Thanksgiving Rally in Hong Kong via video in a Facebook post the same day, geotagged at the site of the rally.The original video of Devin’s address is also available on YouTube.Yue posted on Twitter a link to a video of an interview he gave to the BBC’s Chinese service on October 18 expressing support for the protesters in Hong Kong.Fragments of that interview without the BBC logo also appear in a YouTube video titled “Solomon Yue Video for 11.28 Assembly.”In their videos, Blackburn, Devin and Yue each expressed support for the protesters in Hong Kong in their fight for human rights and democracy, and criticized China’s government.

289;;;;Partially True;Vasily Piskarev;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/apple-russia-crimea-ukraine/6742276.html;Russia Exaggerates Apple’s Move to Label Crimea as Russian;2019-11-29;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;“Apple has recognized Crimea as Russian,” declared the headline of a news report posted by the Interfax news agency on Nov. 27.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in April 2014. No U.N. member nation, including the United States, has recognized the annexation as legal.In December 2016, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing Crimea as being “temporarily occupied” by Russia.Most of Russia’s state media has used language similar to Interfax’s in the headlines of their reports about Apple’s decision to label Crimea as Russian territory.The news of the U.S. tech giant’s move came from Vasily Piskarev, chair of the committee on security and anti-corruption in the State Duma (the lower house of Russia’s parliament), who said Apple had made “corrections” to the geographical names of Crimea and Sevastopol in accordance with the Russian constitution.However, missing from Piskarev’s comments and the Russian media reports about them was the fact that the changes only applied inside Russia. Outside Russia, Apple maps and weather applications seem to continue displaying Crimea as part of Ukraine. Apple did not respond to Polygraph.info's request for comment.Moreover, the change in how Apple’s maps display Crimea and Sevastopol is not new: it was announced back in May by the chair of the Duma’s committee on information policy, information technologies and communications, Leonid Levin. The latest “correction” only concerns Apple’s weather application.In its Nov. 27 report, Interfax noted that “negotiations” between Russia and Apple over the issue had been going on since May and that the company had asked that deadlines be extended for “technical reasons.” According to the news agency, Piskarev said that the Duma had reminded Apple that designating Crimea as Ukrainian territory was a criminal offense under Russian law.“We will continue to monitor, so that there is no going back,” Interfax quoted Piskarev as saying.In July 2014, the Duma amended the country’s law against incitement to separatism to include any public declaration that Crimea is part of Ukraine. Violation of that law is punishable by up to four years in prison. It also applies to foreign companies doing business in Russia, which, if prosecuted on these grounds, risk being fined and/or banned from Russia.The “Crimea” amendment has since been used to prosecute journalists, bloggers and political activists.According to the profile of OOO Apple Rus, Apple’s subsidiary in Russia, in the Russian tax authority’s database, the company’s profits in Russia had been growing since it first registered in December 2011, but showed a sharp decrease in 2016-2017.Since 2014, Roskomnadzor, the Russian government agency that oversees media and telecommunications, has insisted that Apple process and store all of its Russian users’ data on servers physically located in Russia. Apple adhered to those demands, Roscomnadzor confirmed in January.The Russian government has demanded that other global tech companies mark Crimea as Russian territory. In 2014, following Russia’s annexation of the Black Sea peninsula, Google Maps adopted the same tactic as Apple, displaying Crimea as Russian territory for users inside Russia and as Ukrainian territory for everyone outside Russia.;https://www.interfax.ru/russia/685775,https://www.polygraph.info/a/the-crimean-annexation-five-years-on/29821928.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/un-general-assembly-crimea-russia-rights-abuses/28186797.html,https://ria.ru/20191127/1561650600.html,https://www.interfax.ru/russia/685775,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50585898,https://tass.com/politics/1059468,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/04/07/2014/57041ef99a794760d3d3fc92,https://meduza.io/cards/kak-v-rossii-presleduyut-za-prizyvy-vernut-krym-ukraine,https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/5791972,https://www.rusprofile.ru/finance/5791972,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/31/how-russia-is-strong-arming-apple-data-security-icloud/,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/04/12/302337754/google-maps-displays-crimean-border-differently-in-russia-u-s;Russia Exaggerates Apple’s Move to Label Crimea as Russian;;;;;;

While not directly denying the accusations against Russia, he implied they were the product of a “Western anti-Russian” conspiracy.“There are those who want to put Russia in the position of being on the defensive, in the position of the accused,” Lavrov said. “Moreover, the accused in everything and everywhere, whatever area of international life you take: conflicts, the economy, energy, gas pipelines, trade in military products -- everywhere Russia violates something or does something that is disadvantageous to one or several Western countries.”He added: “From their point of view, the more such decisions are made, the better, they think, for their anti-Russian line of argument.”RUSSIA -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a meeting of the Russian-French Security Cooperation Council in Moscow, September 9, 2019This is not the first such comment by Russia’s top diplomat, who said earlier this year that the “Anglo-Saxon group of states” had invented and imposed the anti-doping rules. Polygraph.info debunked that claim.Lavrov’s suggestion that an anti-Russian conspiracy was behind the recommendations by WADA’s CRC is likewise false.As the CRC document clearly states, Russia is receiving same treatment as any other nation under investigation for doping its athletes.In order to avoid the sanctions, Russia needed to provide WADA’s investigative team with authentic copies of the database of the Moscow laboratory that was at the center of the doping scandal. Instead, the CRC said, Russia forged the data -- falsifying, altering and deleting hundreds of files.In response, WADA gave the Russian authorities yet another opportunity to rectify the situation, sending to Moscow a list of technical questions and giving them additional months to respond.Instead, Russia responded with “lies and propaganda,” the newly-appointed CEO of RUSADA, Yury Ganus, said in October.RUSSIA -- Yury Ganus, Director General of Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), attends a news conference in Moscow, June 19, 2019Commenting on the latest WADA CRC recommendations, Ganus said “you can use political slogans as much as you like,” but the “reality of the situation” is that Russia’s sports authorities “did not do what could have been done” to explain the alterations to the database.“There are no legal grounds to dispute the non-compliance (decision),” he said. “I am speaking about this realistically and with understanding of the matter,” Ganus said.""There is minimal hope that WADA will make a different decision, but we are the most disgraced country in the history of world sports, and, apparently, the world sports community is disposed towards taking a hardline,"" said Vyacheslav Fetisov, a member of the State Duma (the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament) who was a famous professional hockey player and coach.";https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-11/wada-compliance-review-committee-recommends-series-of-strong-consequences-for,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191126/1561607782.html,https://russian.rt.com/sport/news/690621-lavrov-komitet-wada-rossiya,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-sports-doping-wada/30119849.html,https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/isccs_april_2018_0.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-sport-doping-wada-rt/29690237.html,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-11/wada-compliance-review-committee-recommends-series-of-strong-consequences-for,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-wada-data-forgery-doping/30208280.html,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191126/1561596458.html?in=t,https://www.mk.ru/sport/2019/11/26/fetisov-nazval-rossiyu-samoy-opozorivsheysya-stranoy-v-istorii-sporta.html;Impending Olympic Ban And The 'West's Anti-Russia Conspiracy';;;;;;

With school closures, flight diversions and a temporary odd-even license plate scheme intended to halve the number of cars on the road daily, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had been ""turned into a gas chamber,” while India's Supreme Court said ""Delhi is choking every year and we are not able to do anything,” The Weather Channel reported.A volunteer from civil defence holds a placard with information regarding restrictions on private vehicles based on registration plates on a smoggy morning in New Delhi, India, November 4, 2019. REUTERS/Danish SiddiquiHowever, a politician has pointed a finger at India’s neighbors for the ongoing environmental emergency.“There is a possibility that this poisonous gas could have been released by any neighboring country which is afraid of us,” Vineet Agarwal Sharda, a leader of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said. “I feel that Pakistan or China are afraid of us.""He then shifted the onus to Pakistan. ""We must seriously consider whether Pakistan has released any poisonous gas,"" Sharda said. Sharda further targeted Kejriwal for blaming the air pollution on agricultural burning in nearby states, saying farmers “are the backbone of our country.” “Farmer(s) and industries should not be blamed,"" Sharda said.But is Pakistan to blame for New Delhi’s pollution woes?Milind Kandlikar, a professor at Canada’s Liu Institute for Global Issues and Institute of Resources, Environment and Sustainability, told Polygraph.info that India’s pollution problem is “almost surely homegrown.” In determining New Delhi’s Air Quality Index, which on November 3 exceeded 900 – 25 times the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization – Kandlikar said the standard air pollutants (PM 2.5, Nox, CO, SOx, VOCs) are being measured. “There are measurements in the air, and models that confirm the numbers. And it all adds up,” he said. “There is no nefarious plot.”Kandlikar said the actual sources of air pollution are myriad, with roughly two-thirds of it coming from “biomass burning of various forms,” including fuelwood for cooking/heating and agricultural waste burning. Industry, power plants and traffic account for the rest. Kandlikar said winter exacerbates the problem because of “specific meteorological conditions” which result in pollutants lingering for greater lengths of time. INDIA -- Hindu women worship the Sun god in the polluted waters of the river Yamuna during the Hindu religious festival of Chatth Puja in New Delhi, November 3, 2019That said, there is always the possibility some pollution (and not “poison”) can reach New Delhi from Pakistan, and vice versa. “Industrial pollution and again burning from Pakistan could contribute a bit to the overall pollution of the entire airshed, I suppose,” Kandlikar said. “But, of course, it could work both ways. Pollutants know no boundaries.” Still, he said, to suggest that a “poison” released from Pakistan could affect New Delhi is a “far-fetched idea.” A ""poison"" released hundreds of kilometers (over 400 Km) away has little chance of affecting people in Delhi. “The ‘poison’ is from within and entirely quotidian,” Kandlikar said.China is even farther away from India, with the Himalayan mountain range forming a border between the two countries. New Delhi has long suffered from air pollution woes.The city was ranked the world’s most polluted capital last year, with nine of the world’s 10 most polluted cities being located in India.In 2014, a World Health Organization (WHO) study of 1,600 cities across 91 countries found that New Delhi at that time had the world's highest annual average concentration of small airborne particles (PM2.5) of 153 micrograms per cubic meter.By 2016, New Delhi dropped to 11th place worldwide, which was attributed to government and industry efforts to curb air pollution. Thus, while Sharda has attempted to shift blame to a neighboring state for New Delhi’s air pollution crisis, Polygraph.info finds his assertion that Pakistan may have released a poisonous gas targeting the Indian capital to be false.";https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-pollution/indian-capital-banishes-some-cars-in-bid-to-curb-hazardous-air-pollution-idUKKBN1XE1B0,https://weather.com/science/environment/news/2019-11-04-hazardous-smog-new-delhi-india-air-quality-index,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-china-may-have-released-poisonous-gas-to-pollute-air-in-india-says-bjp-leader-2127926,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/03/flights-diverted-in-delhi-as-toxic-smog-hits-worst-levels-of-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-pollution/new-delhi-is-worlds-most-polluted-capital-beijing-eighth-idUSKCN1QM1FH,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/here-are-the-worlds-10-most-polluted-cities--9-are-in-india.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/delhi-air-pollution-who-china/india-rejects-who-report-saying-new-delhi-has-worst-air-pollution-idINKBN0DO12M20140508,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/mgVmRwZjpCzC41Vli0jgMI/80-of-worlds-city-dwellers-breathing-bad-air-says-UN.html;Indian Politician: Pakistan May Have ‘Released Poison Gas’ Over Polluted New Delhi;;;;;;

There is absolutely no proof of any of that, and I am not aware of any actions like this,"" Butina said, “rejecting,” according to TASS, “allegations that there were [sic] some ‘government person’ behind her.”TASS’s rendering of this portion of the 60 Minutes interview is misleading.First, TASS makes no mention of Alexander Torshin, whom Butina admitted had “directed” her activities as a foreign agent in the United States. Torshin, who resigned as deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank in November 2018 – one month prior to Butina’s guilty plea – was also a former Russian senator who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Politico, a U.S. newspaper, FBI counterintelligence linked Torshin to a “U.S.-Russia exchange program” that the agency alleges “was an elaborate cover for a Washington-based Russian spy recruiting effort.”A screenshot of Maria Butina's vKontakte post with a photograph of her standing next to Alexander Torshin in Washington, DCPolitico also reported that Torshin helped facilitate the so-called “Illegals Program” spy swap, in which 10 Russian operatives who had been living undercover in the U.S. for years (including “Anna Chapman”) were exchanged for four Russian citizens imprisoned by Russia on espionage charges.In April 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Torshin for election interference, while Spanish investigators have linked him to Russian mafia activity.Spanish police have accused Alexander Torshin of Laundering Money for Russia's ""Taganskaya"" Crime SyndicateCBS reported it obtained thousands of private Twitter messages between Butina and Torshin, which apparently caught Butina off guard.One exchange went as follows:Stahl: Was [Torshin] close to Putin?Butina: I don't think so.Stahl: So you wrote him a message and you said, ""You are an influential member of [Putin's] team."" Your words.Butina: It doesn't suggest he's close to Putin in any way.Stahl: But was he an influential member of Putin's team?Butina: I don't know.Stahl: Well, you wrote that. You know, in reading through your messages it reads as if he's -- your intelligence case officer.Butina: Look, this is-- I think it's an American, very old saying that suggests that wolves have teeth, but not all animals with teeth are wolves. You cannot judge a person based on appearance.Stahl did not merely allege some government person was behind Butina, as reported by TASS.Stahl said “you can get the impression that there's some government person higher than Torshin kinda directing this whole thing, pulling the strings,” citing actions that implied “they needed to run the decision up to a more senior level.”John Demers, the U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, in a CBS interview called Butina’s answers “a masterpiece of disinformation.”“It had conflation, obfuscation, changing the subject, accusing you of being sexist, accusing the American people of being racist against Russians whenever the questions got difficult… trying to change the topic. Partial denials,” Demers told 60 Minutes.RUSSIA -- Maria Butina, who served nine months in a U.S. jail for acting as a Russian government agent arrives at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on October 26, 2019, a day after her release from prison.As Stahl noted, upon being greeted with a “media frenzy” after returning to Moscow, Butina “immediately started giving interviews about the conditions of her incarceration.”Likewise, the TASS article, titled “Butina says being in US prison was 'torture',” hit on many of those disinformation themes, while ignoring most of the evidence presented by Stahl and opting not to mention Torshin at all.Polygraph.info thus finds TASS’s presentation of the Butina interview to be misleading.";https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-butina-interview-full-transcript-watch-video-lesley-stahl-60-minutes-exclusive/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-butina-us-passport-nra-russiagate/29631014.html,https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5626092-US-v-Butina-Plea-Agreement-and-SOF-EXECUTED.html,https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1080766/download,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/14/russia-americans-putin-torshin-776237,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/06/600083466/u-s-hits-russian-oligarchs-and-officials-with-sanctions-over-election-interferen,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/mobster-or-central-banker-spanish-cops-allege-this-russian-both;Russian News Agency Omits Torshin Link Cited in Butina’s 60 Minutes Interview;;;;;;

In 1997, the International Association of Genocide Scholars unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide.The U.S. Holocaust Museum’s archives provide detailed evidence of the systematic mass extermination and expulsion of the ethnic Armenians, with estimates of the number of victims ranging from several hundred thousand to 1.5 million.US/Armenia - Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian and Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin II visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington, 06May,2015Turkey and Azerbaijan deny the Armenian genocide.According to the Armenian National Institute in Washington, DC, as of 2019, the governments of 29 countries recognized the Armenian genocide, including the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Russia.While the governments of Switzerland, Greece, Cyprus and Slovakia adopted laws criminalizing denial of the Armenian genocide, the United Kingdom has refused to recognize the massacre of ethnic Armenians as genocide, saying the 20th century events did not fully meet the conditions of the United Nation’s Genocide Convention.“The massacres were an appalling tragedy, which the British Government of the day condemned. We fully endorse that view. However, neither this Government nor previous British Governments have judged that the evidence is sufficiently unequivocal to persuade us that these events should be categorized as genocide as defined by the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide, a convention which is, in any event, not retrospective in application,” the UK said in 2007.However, the UK’s three devolved legislatures – Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales – have recognized the Armenian genocide.Infographic - Armenian genocideAlthough most of sources list the U.S. among the nations that recognized the Armenian genocide, the question of whether the United States has officially recognized it, as the House resolution states, remains a matter of dispute.There is no vote scheduled in the Senate on the resolution and the U.S. Senate Historical Office has identified no instance when the upper chamber approved a similar resolution recognizing the genocide.“There have been a number of resolutions introduced over the years, but it looks like the closest one came to passage was in early 1990 when a resolution introduced by Bob Dole of Kansas made it to the floor for consideration,” Assistant Historian Daniel Hold wrote to Polygraph.info. Dole’s resolution failed two procedural votes. At the time, Sen. Dole was minority leader in the Senate, as the leading Republican Party member.Despite President Reagan’s use of the term in the 1981 proclamation, the Obama White House never referred to the 1915 Armenian atrocities as “genocide,” with the former ambassador to the U.N. now calling the failure a “mistake.”Erdoğan’s recent comments are not out of character. During his presidential campaign in 2014, Erdoğan, then Turkey’s prime minister, said in interview with the national TV channel NTV: ""I was called a Georgian. I apologize for this, but they even said [something] worse: They called me an Armenian,"" sparking outrage and accusations of racism.In 2016, reacting to the German Bundestag’s recognition of the Armenian genocide, Erdoğan said: ""I am addressing the whole world. You may like it, you may not. Our attitude on the Armenian issue has been clear from the beginning. We will never accept the accusations of genocide.""In their October 2006 open letter, the leaders of the International Association of Genocide Scholars said historians who deny the Armenian genocide are pursuing a political agenda.“Scholars who deny the facts of genocide in the face of the overwhelming scholarly evidence are not engaging in historical debate, but have another agenda. In the case of the Armenian Genocide, the agenda is to absolve Turkey of responsibility for the planned extermination of the Armenians—an agenda consistent with every Turkish ruling party since the time of the Genocide in 1915,” the letter said.";https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hres296ih/xml/BILLS-116hres296ih.xml,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hres296ih/xml/BILLS-116hres296ih.xml,http://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&context=ustjlpp,https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/research/speeches/42281c,https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/US-Congress_-Armenian-Resolution.pdf,https://www.ushmm.org/search/results/?q=armenian+genocide,https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-armenian-genocide-1915-16-overview,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114jhrg95113/html/CHRG-114jhrg95113.htm,https://www.armenian-genocide.org/recognition_countries.html,https://www.vox.com/2015/4/22/8465257/armenian-genocide,https://www.rferl.org/a/armenia-genocide-recognition/26974215.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/apr/23/britain-sidesteps-armenian-genocide-recognition-a-century-after-killings,https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crimeofgenocide.aspx,https://news.am/eng/news/12175.html,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-house-officially-recognizes-armenian-genocide,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/06/is-armenian-an-insult-turkeys-prime-minister-seems-to-think-so/,https://www.dw.com/en/erdogan-turkey-will-never-accept-genocide-charges/a-19307115,https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Scholars-Denying-Armenian-Genocide-.pdf;Erdogan Calls U.S. House of Representatives’ Resolution on Armenian Genocide ‘Slander’;;;;;;

It found that the members of Russia’s U.N. delegation, whose names had been disclosed to the public, were the targets of U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, including a travel ban, and thus the U.S. State Department would have violated U.S. law by issuing entry visas to those who are targeted by sanctions.An investigation of RIA Novosti’s most recent claim reveals it is false.The Sixth CommitteeThe Sixth Committee, or Legal Committee, held its meeting on October 14 after a “several hour delay.” In his opening remarks, the committee’s chairman, Michal Mlynar of Slovakia, said the delay was related to procedure and the program.A diplomat present at the Sixth Committee meeting told the Voice of America’s U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer that the RIA Novosti claim “is not quite correct.”“We suspended for a few hours to continue informal consultations on the Program of Work, which in the end was adopted this morning. It was linked to concerns voiced by Iran about the limited ability of their delegation to function in the Sixth Committee due to some visa-related issues. Iran took the floor yesterday afternoon and also last Monday,” the diplomat told VOA.After the Sixth Committee’s chairman opened its morning session on October 14, Iran’s representative took the floor. Confirming the diplomat’s comments to VOA, the Iranian representative’s statement concerned the Iranian delegations’ visa issues.The First CommitteeThe First Committee, or Disarmament and International Security Committee, held its morning meeting on October 14. No delays or suspensions were reported.Russia was mentioned at the end of the meeting in an announcement by the secretariat, stating that the Russian delegation would be holding an informal consultation at 3 p.m. – the same time the afternoon session of the First Committee was scheduled to start.As video footage of the First Committee afternoon meeting shows, the regular proceedings during the session were interrupted.However, contrary to RIA Novosti’s claim, the suspensions were not in solidarity with Russia, but due to requests by the Ukrainian and the U.S. delegations for “consultation breaks,” to which the Russian representative objected, demanding the meeting to continue with general debate. After several breaks, the session continued according to its schedule.A Detailed Debrief of the First Committee SessionPolygraph.info provides below a detailed debrief of the meeting transcribed from the live video feed, which demonstrates that the RIA Novosti claim was indeed false:Ukraine’s representative took the floor after the chairman’s opening remarks and requested a break to consult on the agenda.Russia’s representative demanded that the chairman provide a clarification on the procedure for holding general debate.The chairman of the First Committee, Sacha Llorenty Soliz of Bolivia, responded by saying the committee is paying “due diligence” to the previously submitted statement by Russia regarding the “lack of issuance of visas to the members of their delegation.”Soliz said that the First Committee leadership held informal consultations at multiple General Assembly levels and with the host country representatives. He said the chair had done “everything he can do in order to resolve the situation,” but that the issue was beyond the remit of the committee. He underscored that the Ukrainian delegation proposed proceeding with the adoption of the general debate schedule.U.S. -- Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily NebenzyaThe Russian representative then took the floor, demanding again that the First Committee continue its proceedings with general debate, according to the agenda adopted on October 8.A U.S. representative then took the floor requesting a ten-minute suspension of the session “just to get the sense of really what is going on here.” However, Cuba’s delegation objected to the break request, after which the chairman granted a five-minute break.The session resumed with the Ukrainian delegation requesting “not to suspend but to adjourn the meeting” to discuss the adoption of the work program.The U.S. representative then requested a 30-minute suspension “to further discuss the issue.”The Russian representative again demanded that the session continue with general debates, but agreed to the U.S. delegation demand to take a 30-minute break.The delegations of Egypt, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Syria and Iran supported the Russian proposal to continue with the general debate.The chairman announced a ten-minute break for consultations after which the session continued according to its schedule.Thus, the RIA Novosti claim that the U.N. General Assembly First and Sixth Committees suspended their work on October 14 in solidarity with the Russian delegation’s visa situation is false.;https://ria.ru/20191015/1559790315.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/poklonskaya-un-hq-crimea/30187544.html,http://webtv.un.org/watch/sixth-committee-12th-meeting-general-assembly-74th-session/6094807154001/,http://webtv.un.org/search/first-committee-5th-meeting-general-assembly-74th-session/6094763413001/?term=first committee&sort=date,http://webtv.un.org/search/first-committee-6th-meeting-general-assembly-74th-session/6094810325001/?term=first committee&sort=date;Russian State News Agency Claims Two UN Committees Strike in Support of Russia;;;;;;

Such [mortars] are produced in NATO countries, including Croatia and Macedonia,” Nikitin said adding that the Soviet Union did not produce such a caliber shell.TV Zvezda interpreted his comment to mean “those shells are only manufactured in NATO countries.”Nikitin claimed that local militia men found the shell in the village of Staromikhailovka, 12 miles west of the city of Donetsk, and that it had been attached to a drone and dropped over a civilian-populated area. The report did not say when the alleged drone attack took place.A VKontakte page for the village posted reports from the Russian media as well as local updates of a shelling and mortar attack that it said began on October 6 and continued on October 7. It said that no casualties had been reported.

Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services (ARES), a specialist technical intelligence consultancy, told Polygraph.info. “Many Central and Eastern European states have produced mortars and/or projectiles in this caliber, as have China, Israel, South Africa, and many other countries.”Another example is the 60mm M57 Mortar, which is produced by the Serbian firm PPT Namenska. Serbia is also not a NATO member.More importantly, Ukraine itself manufacturers a mortar of this caliber.Kyiv-based Zavod Mayak developed a 60mm M60 Camertone mortar system specifically to meet the needs of Ukrainian armed forces in the Donbas conflict, having first put it on display in 2016.According to the Ukrainian Defense Review (UDR), the mortar system is intended to be “fired against enemy personnel and vehicles sheltered in trenches and behind shields.”UDR reports the M60 Camertone mortar system was formally accepted for use by Special Operations Forces in December 2017, and later tested in the Donbas conflict area.That report specifically states the 60mm mortar is an effective defense against Russia-backed insurgents engaged in offensive actions in defiance of the Minsk accords.As for the Minsk Accords, intended to halt hostilities in the Donbas region, Nikitin’s assertion that the protocol limits mortars to 82 mm is incorrect.Ukraine -- Ukrainian servicemen prepare their tanks to withdraw not far from Mariupol, Donetsk region, October 20, 2015 as part of the Minsk Protocol.In fact, the agreement actually calls for both sides to pull back all artillery under 100mm caliber a minimum of 31 miles from the so-called line of contact, in order to create a safety or buffer zone.With only fragments of a mortar in hand, Nikitin provided neither evidence that the shell was produced in a NATO country nor that it was used to target civilians in eastern Ukraine.Jenzen-Jones said he could not conclusively identify the origin of the mortar, but added there might be “markings on the remnant—or identifying physical characteristics—that are not visible in the video.""However, Nikitin was vague concerning the place of manufacture, specifically noting NATO countries, “including Croatia and Macedonia,” without identifying which one.There would be nothing inherently illicit about Ukraine possessing mortars made by NATO countries, as they are a standard artillery weapon used by militaries all over the world. Likewise, there is no “loophole” in a country using weapons that fall within the proscribed limits of the Minsk Protocol.Polygraph.info therefore finds his statements to be misleading.";https://vk.com/public98671017,https://www.osce.org/files/b/8/table_ceasefire--2019-10-06.pdf?download=true,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/10/b/bb/bb0e001d-e7aa-465d-86d6-b623d525950b_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-east-ukraine-nato-mortar/6741075.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741075.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741075.html&text=Pro-Russia+Separatist+in+Ukraine+Claims+Mortar+is+NATO-Made,/a/6741075.html,/embed/player/Article/6741075.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://issuu.com/ukrainian_defense_review/docs/udr_02,https://www.osce.org/ru/cio/140221?download=true;Pro-Russia Separatist in Ukraine Claims Mortar is NATO-Made;;;;;;

Sochi, October 3, 2019“We should not cast our closest neighbor and fraternal nation in some kind of unfavorable light. One can talk about the policies of the current authorities, but not about the country, not about the people,” Putin said. He added: “Strange as it may seem, even the state [Russian television] channels have an independent editorial policy.”Rossiya-1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva responded to Putin on her Telegram messaging service channel, saying that presenting Ukraine in a negative light had “never been done on purpose.”That is false.Oleksandra Tsekhanovska of the Ukraine Crisis Media Center told Polygraph.info a disproportionate amount of Russian state TV airtime is dedicated to Ukraine, the bulk of which is negative.“According to our research, jointly performed with the Estonian Center of Eastern Partnership, approximately 1/3 of all news and political talk shows on Russian top-3 channels are dedicated to Ukraine,” Tsekhanovska said, adding that 90% of the coverage has been “negative.”Tsekhanovska said those three channels -- Rossiya-1, Channel 1 and NTV -- are completely controlled by the Kremlin.Screen shot taken from the Ukraine Crisis Media Center Report, “Image of the EU and Eastern Partnership Countries on Russian TV."" http://ucmc.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Europe-image-in-Russian-TV-1.pdfCiting 2017 polling data compiled by the independent Levada Center, the Ukraine Crisis Media Center noted that 90% of Russians watch news on TV, with the three stations cited above accounting for 42% of the audience share.Screen shot taken from the Ukraine Crisis Media Center Report, “Image of Ukraine on Russian TV."" http://ucmc.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Image-of-Ukraine-on-Russian-TV_ENG.pdfThe preponderance of news coverage focusing on Ukraine at the expense of domestic news events in Russia even sparked the “#чётамухохлов” (“what’s going on with the Ukrainians”) meme, in which the Ukrainians are labelled with a degrading term.“As a TV-host for one of the most popular programs on the governmentally-controlled channel with a carefully established agenda that includes systematic anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, Skabeyeva, without a doubt, knew exactly what she and her colleagues were doing and did it intentionally,” Tsekhanovska said.However, Tsekhanovska said, admitting that reality would undermine Putin’s argument that the media is not “under the Kremlin’s control” and “the illusion of freedom of speech in Russia.”Yevhen Fedchenko, director at the Kyiv-based Mohyla School of Journalism and co-founder of the Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake, told Polygraph.info his organization had worked for five years to provide a clear answer to Skabeyeva’s statement, adding the anti-Ukrainian propaganda has been “intentional, systemic and very extensive.”“The Kremlin built the whole system of disinformation to discredit Ukraine and promote metanarratives that are used now,” he said.Fedchenko said mainstream media programs like Skabeyeva's talk show “60 Minutes” serve as an entry point for disinformation that is then “amplified by social media.”StopFake conducted a wide-ranging quantitative analysis of 919 fake stories published about Ukraine from March 2014 to June 2017. The study demonstrated how those fake narratives about Ukraine were systematically pushed through the media ecosystem.The study found that Russian TV, state news agencies and some ostensibly private media outlets were a significant source for disinformation, with Rossiya 24 putting out 48 fake stories, RT (38), LIFE (38), NTV (32), TASS (31), Lenta.ru (30), Channel 1 (25) and Komsomolskaya Pravda (20).“In general, analysis of the theme narratives of fake news stories demonstrates continuous attempts of Russian propaganda to construct an image of Ukraine as a failed state, by means of delegitimization of its armed forces, government and policies in different areas,” the report stated.A screen capture from the StopFake report, ""Fakes Debunked by the StopFake Project between 2014-2017: Narratives and Sources.""“Another key element for the construction of Ukraine’s image, along with the failed state one, is to show Ukrainian society as such where the ultraright opinions and groups gain more weight.”Notorious fakes include the 2014 Slovyansk crucifixion story, in which Channel 1 ran a false report claiming Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old boy in Eastern Ukraine.Tsekhanovska, who noted the “vehement criticism” directed at Ukrainian authorities on Russian TV, said the “Ukraine is a failed state narrative” carried over into negative portrayals of the Ukrainian people, as well as their culture and history.“Ukrainians are constantly portrayed as Russophobic and fascist, their culture is ridiculed and negatively stereotyped and the idea is promoted that they are not a ‘real’ nation, as Ukraine is not an actual state but a ‘business project’ and ‘a historic mistake’,” she said.Skabeyeva herself has engaged in dismissive rhetoric regarding Ukraine. After The Law on Ensuring the Functioning of Ukrainian as the State Language went into effect on July 16, Skabeyeva wrote on her Telegram channel that Russian could only be spoken in everyday life and at church. She mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose first language is Russian, writing “he hired a [Ukrainian language] tutor one month ago” and adding: “What a laughable country.”After The Law on Ensuring the Functioning of Ukrainian as the State Language went into effect on July 16, Skabeyeva wrote on her Telegram channel that Russian could only be spoken in everyday life and at church. Speaking about Ukraine, she said: “What a laughable country.”Contrary to Skabeyeva’s claim, Russian can still be used in kindergarten and elementary school; publishing, print and broadcast media; and cultural events, among other areas of life.Skabeyeva has said that several works by the Kyiv-born author Mikhail Bulgakov would look “funny and strange” in the Ukrainian language.She has also delivered reports under the title “Ukrainian Circus,” often calling Ukrainians “insane” and claiming the “insane” were the “face of their nation.”Therefore, Polygraph.info finds Skabeyeva’s claim that she has never intentionally reported on Ukraine in an unfavorable light to be false.";https://tass.ru/politika/6961469?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=smm_social_share,https://tsn.ua/ru/tsikavinki/che-tam-u-hohlov-socseti-trollyat-rossiyan-za-bezrazlichie-k-situacii-v-rf-421491.html,https://www.stopfake.org/en/fakes-debunked-by-the-stopfake-project-between-2014-2017-narratives-and-sources/?fbclid=IwAR2YZxnkjgKSUT8Ildl7sWjqb4agZLyXfSllSGNQ7vyEKMMh4vW-SMbzH_g,https://www.stopfake.org/en/lies-crucifixion-on-channel-one/,https://news.ru/society/skabeeva-russkaya-literatura-socseti/;Russian TV Host Claims Ukraine Bashing Not on Purpose;;;;;;
297;;;;Likely true;Yuri Ganus;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-wada-data-forgery-doping/6742246.html;Russia Responded to WADA Data Manipulation Inquiry with ‘Lies and Propaganda’;2019-10-09;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that Russia met the October 9 deadline for responding to questions regarding “inconsistencies” in the data WADA investigators retrieved from a Moscow laboratory in January as part of a massive doping investigation.The agency said its Intelligence and Investigations Team and independent forensic experts will analyze Russia’s response, adding that “no fixed timeline can be set for this” but that WADA is pursuing the matter “robustly and as quickly as practicable.”The timeframe reference is specifically important for Russia. If WADA finds Moscow’s response to its inquiry insufficient or that Russia intentionally forged the data before granting the WADA investigators access to the Moscow lab’s computers and servers, the penalties for Russian sports could be severe, including a ban on Russia’s National Olympic and Paralympic Committees.Yuri Ganus, the CEO of RUSADA, Russia’s anti-doping agency, said this situation puts the nation’s sports on the verge of an “abyss.” In an unprecedented move, Ganus published an open letter calling Russia’s response to the data manipulation inquiry “lies and propaganda,” saying his agency had nothing to do with the alleged data forgery. RUSSIA -- Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) director general Yury Ganus speaks during a press conference in Moscow, March 26, 2019“An avalanche of lies grows daily, which is used to hide the true reasons of the anti-doping campaign failure,” Ganus wrote. “… [T]he media space of Russian sports is gradually filled with lies about the situation with database changes, covering those, who brought our sport out to the doping crisis standstill. What opinion can be formed when the media space is filled with materials, which are obviously sponsored? Is there nothing else to answer WADA on Moscow laboratory database distortions? So let's fill the space with appropriate false content of loyal media?”In an interview with the Izvestia daily, Ganus said the discrepancies in the data discovered by WADA could not be accidental.“The amount of data that was transferred by the Russian side to WADA representatives in January cannot be changed with one random click,” Ganus said.That claim is likely true.While WADA did not fully detail the data its investigators retrieved from Moscow, bits of information from the agency’s reports show that Ganus was correct in saying the data breach could not have been accidental.SOUTH KOREA -- Olympic Athletes from Russia parade under a neutral flag during the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at the Pyeongchang Stadium, February 9, 2018In a July 2 progress report on its Russia investigation, WADA said its intelligence had identified a “target pool” of 298 athletes representing 578 samples with the most suspicious data. It also said WADA’s Intelligence and Investigations Team had provided an estimated 500 gigabytes of data from the Moscow laboratory to the International Association of Athletics Federations’ Athletic Integrity Unit. It was in this report that WADA first disclosed its problems with the Russian data.“While much has been achieved since the data and samples were retrieved, a lot of highly technical and protracted work remains in collaboration with leading experts in digital forensics. This includes examining some differences identified between the LIMS database provided by a whistleblower in October 2017 and the version WADA I&I removed from the laboratory in January 2019, and any impact that these may have on bringing cases forward,” the report stated.In a September 23 progress report, WADA said its investigators had identified only 47 cases that were “unaffected and contained no inconsistencies in the data.”SWITZERLAND - Lawyer Richard McLaren, investigator for WADA, delivers his speech addressing his findings on Russian State-Sponsored doping systems during the opening day of the 2017 WADA conferenceThe whistleblower database WADA referred to led to what has become known as the McLaren Report, concerning allegations and evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia, after which an investigation was launched into “institutionalized manipulation of the doping control process” in Russian sports. While the Russian sports authorities continue to deny any wrongdoing, Ganus’s criticism has been sympathetically received by some in the Russian media.The famous Russian TV journalist and commentator Vladimir Posner said he was very concerned by the situation.“Does it bother you that in the event the fraudulent activity is confirmed, the whole world will point a finger at Russia and say that we are deceivers and cannot be trusted? And this, of course, will apply not only to sports. It worries me very much!” Posner wrote on Instagram.;https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-10/wada-update-regarding-rusada-code-compliance,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-sports-doping-wada/30119849.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-sport-doping-wada-rt/29690237.html,https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/russia-may-face-2020-tokyo-olympics-ban-over-doping-data-tampering-accusations/,https://rusada.ru/en/news/slovo-direktora/otkrytoe-pismo-generalnogo-direktora-rusada/,https://iz.ru/929160/aleksei-fomin/rukovoditelei-wada-budut-sudit-po-deistviiam-v-otnoshenii-rossii,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-07/wada-provides-international-federations-with-first-batch-of-cases-in-russia,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-cyber-espionage-microsoft/29447856.html,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-09/wada-executive-committee-discusses-rusada-code-compliance,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2017-11/wada-in-possession-of-new-intelligence-from-moscow-laboratory,https://www.polygraph.info/a/wada-russia-doping-mutko-medvedev/28191918.html,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191008/1559558396.html,https://rsport.ria.ru/20191008/1559550108.html;Russia Responded to WADA Data Manipulation Inquiry with ‘Lies and Propaganda’;;;;;;

The FBK accused Medvedev of being “one of [Russia’s] richest people and one of its most corrupted officials.” It also released a written report containing what it called “irrefutable evidence” substantiating those claims.In December 2015, another FBK investigation alleged that the family of Russia’s Attorney General Yuri Chaika likewise built a business empire through illicit means.That same year, reports claimed that Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was living in an $18 million-dollar mansion. His predecessor, Anatoliy Serdyukov, had been forced out of office due to a corruption scandal in 2012, only to be amnestied by a 2014 presidential decree.In 2015, Serdyukov was picked to head the state-owned military-industrial holding conglomerate Rostec. That same year, his advisor and alleged mistress, Evgeniya Vasilyeva, was sentenced to five years in prison for a real estate fraud case that cost the government an estimated $60 million. She was paroled less than four months into her sentence (amid speculation she never stepped foot inside of a prison).In 2013, former head of state-owned Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin was accused of amassing a multi-billion dollar fortune through graft, as well as a business empire spanning a global network of offshore companies. Among his alleged illicit gains were a $100 million estate.MOSCOW, RUSSIA. JUNE 1, 2015. RZD Russian Railways chief Vladimir Yakunin (L front) gets off a Strizh high speed train at Kursky railway station. The newly launched rail service operates between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod. Valery Sharifulin/TASSIn 2018, Viktor Zolotov, commander-in-chief of the National Guard of Russia, Security Council member and presidential bodyguard, was implicated in various corruption scandals, including one involving the theft of millions of dollars from procurement contracts intended to buy soldiers food.In May 2015, Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Open Russian Foundation released a documentary alleging that the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, essentially extorted an unofficial tax from all Chechen citizens in order to finance his Akhmad Kadyrov Regional Public Fund, bringing in anywhere from $53 million to $71 million a month.In 2017, Chechnya received roughly $630 million in federal transfer payments. Most of those transfers are thought to be siphoned off through corruption.Despite strict controls on information coming in and out of Chechnya, evidence of Kadyrov’s opulence has surfaced, including a private jet, lavish birthday celebrations costing millions of dollars and a stable of horses whose upkeep costs hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.Sergei Stepashin, a former Russian prime minister who later headed the country’s watchdog Audit Chamber, said Kadyrov “owns” Chechnya.Meanwhile, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov was infamously photographed wearing a $620,000 watch, which he claimed was a wedding gift from his new wife.The watch Dmitry Peskov was photographed wearing at his wedding is a 'Richard Mille' worth 37,000,000 Roubles ($620,000)"" -- some four times his annual salary.Peskov’s ex-wife, meanwhile, was later alleged to have bought a $2 million home in Paris despite being unemployed.Then there is Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, who is alleged to have amassed a fortune ranging from $40 billion to $200 billion, depending on the estimate.Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist and resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., alleged that since 2016, Putin and his inner circle had extracted $15 billlion to $25 billion a year, reaching a total of $195 billion to $325 billion, “a large share of the Russian private offshore wealth.”In 2016, the Panama Papers – millions of documents leaked from the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca – appeared to substantiate part that scheme.Polygraph.info video fact check by Nik Yarst.The Panama Papers revealed that Sergei Roldugin, a cellist, lifelong friend and godfather to Putin’s eldest daughter, Maria, had helped moved billions of dollars through a series of shell companies.Through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, another data leak, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found that a number of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin were engaged in opaque offshore schemes years after the passage of a so-called de-offshorization law, which required Russian citizens to declare such holdings to support Russia’s tax base.A prominent example was Putin’s cousin, Igor Putin, who was a manager and executive board member at the Russian Land Bank. That bank wired more than $9.7 billion to a Moldovan bank as a part of the so-called “Russian Laundromat” scandal. The Russian Laundromat saw $20 billion to $80 billion siphoned out of Russia between 2010 to 2014.Polygraph.info therefore finds RT’s story regarding Russia’s top six corruption cases to be well off the mark and so is judged to be misleading.";https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/09/2/22/22988413-d9da-4c94-a3f2-861b1bea0310_mobile.mp4,/a/rt-top-6-corruption-fact-check/6741069.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741069.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741069.html&text=RT+Avoids+800-Pound+Gorilla+in+Top-6+Corruption+story,/a/6741069.html,/embed/player/Article/6741069.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://dimon.navalny.com/#intro,https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-dm-shoigu-accused-owning-mansion/27330203.html,http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20131128/269880521.html,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/08/26/how-to-steal-60-million,https://navalny-en.livejournal.com/93479.html,https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/8922-putin-s-bodyguards-rewarded-with-land-and-power,https://www.occrp.org/en/other-articles/8930-three-bodyguards-and-their-riches,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/4029-chechen-corruption-documentary-receives-more-than-a-million-youtube-views,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/05/22/chechen-leader-kadyrov-says-his-underage-children-earn-more-than-putin-a58055,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2017/03/08/rapper-accidentally-reveals-lavish-private-jet-apparently-belonging-to-chechen-ruler-ramzan-kadyrov-a57370,https://www.rferl.org/a/profile-ramzan-kadyrov-chechnya-russia-putin/26802368.html,https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/154679/,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/08/03/putin-s-spokesman-and-his-terrible-wristwatch-fetish,https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-wealth-aslund-propaganda-fact-check/29940697.html,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore,https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/02/the-u-s-list-of-wealthy-russians-and-our-offshore-investigations/,http://www.mondaq.com/caymanislands/x/597782/tax+authorities/Russian+Deoffshorization+The+New+CFC+Rules,https://www.occrp.org/en/laundromat/the-russian-laundromat-exposed/;RT Avoids 800-Pound Gorilla in Top-6 Corruption story;;;;;;

Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, during which he outlined tactics the U.S. Air Force is developing in response to the threat of long-range Russian missile launchers positioned in Kaliningrad.Kaliningrad’s strategic geographic location in the heart of Europe – between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea – makes this Russian exclave potentially the most dangerous territory from which Moscow could launch a military offense against the rest of Europe.As of 2014, Russia had deployed its most advanced strategic weapons and some 225,000 personnel in seven military bases in Kaliningrad. Since then, those numbers are thought to have increased.RUSSIA -- A view shows a new S-400 ""Triumph"" surface-to-air missile system after its deployment at a military base outside the town of Gvardeysk near Kaliningrad, March 11, 2019Indeed, Russia reportedly has been building up its military presence in Kaliningrad.The exclave “practically bristles with S-300 and S-400 air-defense missiles, Oniks anti-ship missiles and Iskander surface-to-surface missiles,” The National Interest wrote on September 19.The U.S. Air Force’s command in Europe has been developing defense plans in response to this increasing threat, Gen. Harrigian said in his September 17 comment. If Russian aggression emanating from the strategically located Kaliningrad exclave required a U.S. response, he said, “it would be a multi-domain, very timely and effective capability that we would bring to ensure we have the access we need in that environment.”A number of Russian officials responded to Harrigian’s comments.“On the one hand, it is not necessary to comment on all the stupid statements made by American generals,” Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. “But, when something like this happens, I was to say to our colleagues that they would be better off looking after their chief business and looking at what is going on with their own missile defense.” He added that the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure happened “despite the presence of the U.S. Patriot missile defense system” at the site.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Of course, security in its various aspects in all regions of the Russian Federation, including Kaliningrad, is provided at the proper level.”Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said “intelligent people … will never make such statements.""EmbedshareRussian TV Host Announces Targets in the U.S. – Some are CivilianEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:050:00Polygraph.info video fact check by Nik Yarst.

300;;;;False;Robot FEDOR;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-robot-tweeting-from-iss/6742221.html;Russian Robot FEDOR Tweeted from Space a Plagiarized Picture of Earth;2019-09-04;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;Russia’s space agency Roscosmos launched an android Skybot F-850 robot called FEDOR (Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research) to the International Space Station (ISS) on a test mission on August 22.Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos said FEDOR’s two-week mission was to learn new skills in space and help the ISS crew. Roscosmos said it was also testing an updated version of the Soyuz2.1a rocket before using it to transport humans into orbit starting next year.On July 23, a month before the launch, a Twitter account @FEDOR37516789 sent its first tweet with a video from the inside of the Soyuz capsule. The tweet said, “Hi everybody! I am Skybot F-859. For friends – simply Fedor. Right now I am getting myself familiar with the command system of the spaceship Soyuz MS-14, on which I plan on flying to the ISS on August 22, 2019.”The FEDOR Twitter account instantly gained 13,000 followers, and it has been tweeting photos and video of the mission’s daily progress. FEDOR also tweeted news reports and Internet memes about itself and its creator -- Yevgeny Dudorov, director of the Android Technology research and development company. Dudorov told Russian media a week prior to the launch that FEDOR’s flight to the ISS was Russia’s response to foreign powers in the space technology race. He noted that the United States has launched its Robonaut 2 humanoid robot to the ISS in 2011 assuming it would help the astronauts inside and outside of the station. The mission failed and the robot was returned back to Earth in 2018, Dudorov said, adding that Roscosmos’ launch of FEDOR to the ISS is Russia’s attempt to restore faith in the possibility of using robots in space.FEDOR’s mission was not flawless. The Soyuz capsule failed to dock with the ISS on its first attempt on August 24, but finally managed to do so on August 27.FEDOR has experienced other failures on the mission, including an attempt to use a screwdriver, but the robot’s Twitter followers reacted to these with understanding. However, that changed on August 31, when FEDOR tweeted a photo of the Strait of Gibraltar, saying: “Admiring our Earth from the porthole of Soyuz-MS14 at the end of the working day. She is beautiful. Studying and exploring space makes people smarter and makes them work together. And we, machines made by humans, are ready to help our creators go further.”FEDOR’s Russian followers hit back with replays accusing the robot of plagiarism. Ilya Varlamov, a famous Russian photo blogger, joined the criticism, writing on Telegram that the photograph had already been popular on the Internet for some time. “The robot FEDOR, sent to the ISS, for some reason did not learn that to pass off someone else's as one’s own – it’s not beautiful! Our cosmonaut turned out to be a photo thief! ”Others on Twitter attributed the original image to a posting by a Spanish Reddit user in 2018.While Varlamov and others were right that FEDOR tweeted an image with a caption suggesting it recently took the photograph, which he did not, they were wrong about the date on which the photograph was taken, and who took it.Forensic examination of the photograph reveals that it is 9 years old -- taken on September 9, 2010 with a NIKON D2Xs camera.Additional research found that the original photograph was taken by the U.S. astronaut Douglas Wheelock @Astro_Wheels in 2010, and that his tweets made headlines at the time, with media and bloggers praising the beauty of his pictures of Earth from space.

301;;;;False;Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-ww2-baltics-democracy/6742219.html;Russia Claims Baltic States Never Turned Democratic;2019-09-02;polygraph;William Echols;"On the eve of the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War on September 1, 1939, Russia’s Foreign Ministry tweeted out an extract from a joint report titled ""The Heritage of WWII in the Baltic States"".That extract read: “In the early 90s the Baltic nations gained their national independence. This event raised hopes & aspirations the Baltic Soviet Republics would turn into modern democratic & rule-of-law states, which, unfortunately, never came true.”Experts, former politicians and diplomats strongly contest the Russian Foreign ministry’s assertion. “Russia’s claim that the Baltic nations never turned into modern, democratic and rule-of-law states is patently false. It is ridiculous that anyone in the Russian Foreign Ministry would claim that,” Matthew Bryza, former U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan told Polygraph.info.Bryza, who was previously director of the International Center for Defense and Security, a Tallinn-based think tank, said that Estonia “is one of the most dynamic, modern, rule-of-law countries in all of the European Union.” Former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves mirrored that sentiment, telling Polygraph.info Estonia is “by far the least corrupt post-communist country.”Ilves said the Russian Foreign Ministry was merely “rehashing” the same baseless arguments Russia has been making for 28 years, adding the Baltic states “wouldn’t’ have been admitted to NATO or the EU if [Russia’s claims] had any merit.”Ilves was referring to the so-called Copenhagen criteria, which determine who is eligible to join the European Union, and criteria for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization Membership Action Plan.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined the EU and NATO in 2004. The EU requires that any potential member have “stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.”NATO only invites aspiring members that have, among other things, “built a democratic system of governance and a market economy.”Aliide Naylor, a writer-in-residence at the Latvia-based International Writers' and Translators' House and the author of the book “The Shadow in the East: Vladimir Putin and the New Baltic Front,” likewise called the Russian Foreign Ministry’s claim “untrue and wildly hypocritical.” “The three Baltic nations have varying degrees of democracy, ‘modernity’, freedom, and corruption,” Naylor told Polygraph.info. “But according to the 2019 [Freedom House] Freedom in the World report, Estonia ranks at 94/100 – a better score than both the U.S. and the U.K. [Latvia was ranked 87 out of 100 and Lithuania 91 out of 100, with 100 meaning most free]. Like any other nation, they still struggle with imperfect political processes, but to say they never turned into modern and democratic states is silly.”Many international organizations have made similar assessment of the Baltic nations’ democratic bona fides.Freedom House, a U.S. government-funded think tank that conducts research and advocacy on democracy and related issues, counted Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia among “consolidated democracies” in its 2018 Nations in Transit 2018 report. That report, which tracked the progress of the former Soviet states, found that 19 of the 29 countries had declines in their overall democracy scores. A screen capture from Freedom House's ""Nations in Transit 2018"" report.Freedom House called Estonia one of “three bright spots,” and raised Estonia’s National Democratic Governance rating from 2.25 to 2.00 (1 – most democratic, 7 – least democratic), citing its “demonstrated resilience and impartiality of national institutions, as well as respect for institutions by all major stakeholders, after the change of government in November 2016.” Estonia’s democratic governance and corruption ratings also improved.Latvia, which Freedom House found to have “continued on its path to becoming a stable north European democracy,” did see its Civil Society score drop, in part because of the rise of illiberal groups. Freedom House also lowered Lithuania’s Civil Society rating, calling corruption the biggest threat to democracy there. The German-based Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation’s Transformation Index (BTI), which analyzes and evaluates successes and setbacks on the path toward a democracy based on the rule of law and a socially responsible market economy, found all three Baltic states to be democracies in consolidation. A screen capture of BTI's Transformation Index, showing all three Baltic states as democracies in consolidation.The BTI ranked Latvia eighth out of 129 countries analyzed for its quality of democracy, market economy and political management, noting that the Baltic country has “free and fair parliamentary and local elections.”The BTI ranked Lithuania in fourth place, saying it has “no constraints on free and fair elections,” while Estonia took the top spot.The German-based Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation’s Transformation Index (BTI), which analyzes and evaluates successes and setbacks on the path toward a democracy, placed Estonia in first place for 2018.“Elections in Estonia are free, fair and meaningful in the sense of determining public policies and filling political positions,” the BTI found.  ‘All states have flaws’ In terms of the media environment, the press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Estonia 11th its 2019 World Press Freedom Index, while Latvia came in 24th and Lithuania placed 30th. RSF’s annual reports cover 180 countries. A screen capture from Reporters Without Borders' 2019 World Press Freedom Index, showing Estonia in 11th place.“Estonia has a freer press than the U.K. and Germany, according to RSF (although in the present more ‘far-right’ climate with [the Conservative People's Party of Estonia] in government, some outspoken liberal journalists may challenge this perceived notion of free press), Naylor said. “Latvia and Lithuania are also doing better than the U.S. and U.K. in terms of press freedom, by these measures.”RSF ranked Germany 13th in terms of press freedom, France 32nd, the U.K. 33rd and the U.S. 48th. It ranked Russia 149th.The Berlin-based anti-corruption NGO Transparency International (TI) compiles a Corruption Perception Index that ranks countries on a scale of 0-100 (0 being maximally corrupt and 100 being maximally clean). On its 2018 Corruption Perception Index, Latvia scored 58, Lithuania 59 and Estonia 73 – respectively, 41st, 38th and 18th out of 180 countries. TI gave Russia a score of 28, putting it in 138th place globally. Vaidas Saldžiūnas, a Lithuanian journalist who writes extensively on defense and security-related issues, told Polygraph.info that even less positive assessments still painted the Baltic states in a mostly positive light. “What comes to my mind first, based on such criteria, is the (Economist Intelligence Unit) Democracy Index 2018. There Estonia is 23rd, Lithuania 36th, Latvia – 38,” he said.The Economist Intelligence Unit describes the Baltic states as “flawed democracies.”Saldžiūnas said that while those less-than-perfect scores are “probably not enough” for critics, they aren’t really “news” given that all states have flaws: “Greece, the birthplace of democracy is behind, the Unites States isn't on the top, yet we are still ahead of 130-plus countries. But when the critique comes from Russia, which is not a beacon of democracy and rule of law (144, behind Kazakhstan and Afghanistan), that says a lot. The international community in various statements recognize [the] Baltic nations as modern, democratic, rule-of-law-based states, which allows for membership in various international organizations.”Loss and projection Dalia Bankauskaitė, a lecturer with Vilnius University’s Faculty of Communication, told Polygraph.info that it is widely believed Russia resents having lost control of its neighbors. This, she said, best explains Moscow’s attitude towards the Baltics. “I would like to quote what a young Lithuanian said during one of our discussions,” Bankauskaitė said. “‘Why can’t the Kremlin leave us alone? The divorce happened long, long ago. We live our life … Mind your own country’.”LITHUANIA -- People take part in a human chain protest in support of the Hong Kong Way, a recreation of a pro-democracy ""Baltic Way"" protest against Soviet rule three decades ago, in Vilnius, August 23, 2019Analysts argue the answer to that question is connected to the current Russian regime’s survival strategy.Bryza said President Vladimir Putin is “obsessed with extinguishing any movement towards democracy and rule-based politics in Russia that could threaten his own rule.”“Any Russian who has visited the Baltics knows how much more advanced those Baltic countries are compared with Russia on developing democracy and the rule of law,” Bryza said. “So I think President Putin is trying to discredit the historical record of success of the Baltic countries to protect himself.”Ilves said that the Kremlin, which has no ideology apart from the “ideology of expediency,” is simply trying to amplify the message that it does not want to follow the “fake rules of Western liberal democracy.”Ilves argues the Baltic states’ post-Soviet transformation “undermines the fundamental lie of the Kremlin” that countries can become liberal, democratic and rule-of-law based nations after exiting Moscow’s orbit. Saldžiūnas believes the Baltic states’ success undermines “the core of the Kremlin lie” that they cannot survive without Russia. “When you say that the Baltic states will fail without Russia (those were actual slogans in late Eighties and early Nineties) and now the facts are proving you wrong (GDP, income, democracy, freedom indexes, etc.), it's bad for your own image. So what do you do? You don't let the facts spoil a good propaganda piece,” he said.According to Saldžiūnas, this leaves Russia in the position of having to soothe its domestic audience with these falsehoods, given that Russia itself “has failed in democracy and has but a façade of it, just like [it has a façade of] the rule of law.”Naylor said she thinks many Russians assume that every country functions like their own, adding that Moscow’s claim that it is the Baltic states, and not Russia, which have failed to turn into modern, democratic, and rule-of-law states, “could be a form of projection at play.”People wave Estonian flags in front of the Estonian Parliament during a festive ceremony to celebrate 100 years since Estonia declared independence for the first time in 1918, in Tallinn on February 24, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Raigo Pajula“There could also be envy at the comparative progress, or resentment about the role they [the Baltic states] played in the Soviet collapse,” she said. Bankauskaitė likewise says that by portraying the Baltic states as “failing states,” the Russian government seeks to make Russians believe that it’s not worth emulating their example and nothing good came from the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The Kremlin’s disinformation never speaks about Russia, it always talks about others in a negative way … I have never seen/read/heard pro-Kremlin media or Kremlin institutions talk positively about Russian civic initiatives,” she said. “Russia and the Kremlin should never be confused,” Bankauskaitė added. “Russian society itself is a victim of Putin’s regime.”";https://www.polygraph.info/a/the-referendum-north-macedonia-name-legal-fact-check/29877961.html,https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/nations-transit-2018,https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/lva/,https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/lva/,https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/ltu/,https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/est/,https://news.err.ee/931290/estonia-ranked-11th-in-2019-world-press-freedom-index,https://news.err.ee/931290/estonia-ranked-11th-in-2019-world-press-freedom-index;Russia Claims Baltic States Never Turned Democratic;;;;;;
302;;;;Likely false;Kommersant, newspaper;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/berlin-assassination-russian-disinfo/6742218.html;Russian Media Push a “Chechen Revenge” Version in the Berlin Assassination – Contradicting Facts and Logic;2019-08-30;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"German security forces are investigating possible involvement of Russian intelligence in the killing of a Georgian citizen in Berlin on August 23.Zalimkhan Khangoshvili, 40, an ethnic Chechen from Georgia, was killed in what the Berlin general prosecutor said was a professionally planned, execution style operation.A prominent figure in the Chechen society worldwide over the years, Khangoshvili was a field commander in the second war against Russia, served as an intermediary between the Georgian security services and the Chechens, and more recently was involved in organizing resistance in the Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine.In Ukraine, Khangoshvili worked with Adam Osmayev, the leader of the Chechen militia fighting against Russia. Osmayev, who Russia claimed was plotting an assassination of the Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2012, survived several attempts on his life, the last of which killed his wife Amina Okuyeva near Kyiv in October 2017. Ukrainian intelligence said the attack was planned and carried out by the Russian security services.Ukraine – Amina Okueva, a participant in the war on the Donbass, during a press conference on the topic: ""The war in Ukraine: Chechen mirror. Exhibition and Conversation."" Kyiv, November 25, 2015Khangoshvili changed his name to Tornike Kavtarashvili and sought refuge in Germany after surviving an assassination attempt in Georgia in 2015. The Russian security services reportedly provided to the German intelligence agencies information branding Khangoshvili as an Islamic extremist and a terrorist.Based on that information, several Russian and Western media outlets reported that Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was on Russia’s official list of wanted terrorists. That information is false. Neither the name Zalimkhan Khangoshvili nor the name Tornike Kavtarashvili is included on the official list, at least not publicly. The suspect detained over the killing last week of a Georgian citizen in BerlinGerman law enforcement detained the suspected killer shortly after he fled from the scene on a bicycle, following eyewitnesses’ alert about the man disposing of his wig, bicycle and handgun -- all recovered later from the Spree River, less than half a mile away from the crime scene.Berlin’s Attorney General said that the suspect, a man of Russian nationality, 49, was brought before the court and arrested. He came to Berlin shortly before the assassination and had an air ticket back to Russia.A German security services’ source told Der Spiegel that the man refused to talk with the investigators and demanded to speak with representatives of the Russian embassy in Berlin instead.The joint investigative team of Belligcat, the German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Russian outlet The Insider discovered that the suspect used a fake identity and a fake address but travelled with a validly issued Russian passport under the name of Vadim Andreevich Sokolov. Based on the findings, the Belligcat investigation concluded, that the Russian denials of involvement in the Berlin assassination were “implausible.”The body of Zalimkhan Khangoshvili was delivered on Thursday, August 29, to his home village of Duisi in Georgia’s Pankisi Gorge and buried according to the Muslim tradition.With Berlin’s increasing suspicions that the killing was a Russian state-organized political assassination and global headlines drawing parallel with the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury, U.K., Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, denied that the Kremlin or any Russian state agency had any connection to the crime.The vast majority of the Russian media promoted an “alternative” version of who was behind the killing in Berlin, pushing forward the message that only the victim’s own kin, the Chechens, could have “dealt with him.” Russian media has been actively providing detailed narratives of Khangoshvili’s “terrorist activities.”The revenge motive is fabricated, Chechens both in Russia and abroad said.While the Russian narrative about the “Chechens from Russia” can potentially have merit based on precedent, Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been implicated in ordering assassinations of his political competitors and critics, carried out by his security guards, friends, and even relatives both in Russia and abroad, including in the Middle East and Europe.RUSSIA -- Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov attends the opening ceremony of the Army 2019 International Military Technical Forum in Patriot Park in Alabino, Moscow region, Russia, 25 June 2019.The Chechen law enforcement services denied any connection with the killing in Berlin, saying Khangoshvili “was Georgian and had lost any ties in Chechnya long ago.” The “Chechens hiding in Europe” narrative has multiple weak points. First, the claim contradicts logic: it is hard to explain why former militia Chechens -- who “hide in Europe,” knowing that Russia is actively seeking their extradition to persecute them for their part in two separatist wars -- would demand to talk with representatives of the Russian embassy, as the arrested suspect did.Moreover, the European Chechen diaspora made it clear – Russia is to blame for Khangoshvili’s assassination.Akhmed Zakayev, one of the most prominent and most sought by Russia leaders of the Chechen separatists in exile in London, U.K. said the killing in Berlin “was demonstrative in nature,” drawing parallels with the assassinations of Kadyrov’s former bodyguard Umar Israilov in Vienna, Austria in 2009 and the poisoning of the Skripals in the U.K. in 2018.Zakayaev, who served as the head of government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) under President Aslan Maskhadov in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said that these “political assassinations” were “acts of the Russian state terrorism.”Anzor Maskhadov, the son of the ChRI President Aslan Maskhadov, who has lived in exile in Europe since Russian security killed his father in 2005, told Polygraph.info that Khangoshvili’s murder has been widely discussed among the Chechens both in Russia and abroad.“I have never heard any Chechen having any issues with Zelimkhan, on the contrary, he was well respected and beloved,” Maskhadov said.Maskhadov said, his father had “almost brotherly” relations with Khangoshvili, who was one of his most trusted field commanders.“I knew him personally, he was a true patriot and never shy of stating his strong opposition against Chechens’ involvement in any jihadi wars abroad -- while Russia is still engaged in a war with us, and in a very vile war,” Maskhadov said. He confirmed Khangoshvili has been receiving death threats, “he was on Russia’s kill list.”“We have only one suspect – the Russian Federation. It was a political execution planned in advance and carried out by the Russian security services’ operatives in Germany,” Maskhadov told Polygraph.info.He, himself has been a target of the Russian security services. There have been kidnapping attempts and death threats that “never stopped,” the last such threat “delivered in a specifically cruel way – via my 70-years-old mother,” Maskhadov said.The main argument for the “Chechen revenge” version promoted by Russian media is Khangoshvili’s role in the so-called “Lopota incident” – an armed standoff between the Georgian security forces and a group of Chechen Islamist militants in 2012. The situation involved hostage taking by the militants and resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides. Although, many details of the operation have never been made public, it has been confirmed that Khangoshvili played a key role in the negotiations to end the stand-off and have the hostages released.While Russia portrayed Khangoshvili as a traitor of the Chechens for making a deal with the Georgian security services, blaming on him the deaths of many of the militants, the Georgian officials said his involvement helped save many lives.“Many do not know that without Zelimkhan’s direct intervention we would have had much more casualties during the Lapankuri special operation,” Nugzar Tsiklauri, a former member of the Georgian Parliament representing the opposition United National Movement party said, adding, “Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was the man who tried his best to prevent Pankisi teenagers from going to the Syrian slaughter.”";https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/russland-berlin-mord-kalter-krieg-1.4576536,https://www.facebook.com/zelimxan.xangoshvili,https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/berlin-moabit-ermittler-gehen-nach-toedlichen-schuessen-von-auftragsmord-aus-a-1283573.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/31/russia-blamed-for-attack-on-chechen-couple-who-fought-with-ukrainian-forces,http://www.fedsfm.ru/search?SearchText=%D0%97%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BD+%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8&SearchType=0&start=&end=&searchIds,https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2019/08/berlin-moabit-fahrradfahrer-erschiesst-mann.html,https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/berlin-moabit-ermittler-gehen-nach-toedlichen-schuessen-von-auftragsmord-aus-a-1283573.html,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/08/30/suspected-assassin-in-the-berlin-killing-used-fake-identity-documents/,https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/in-berlin-moabit-erschossener-georgier-der-raetselhafte-zelimkhan-k-und-die-verwicklung-russischer-geheimdienste/24942718.html,https://www.stern.de/panorama/stern-crime/mord-in-berlin--toetet-ein-geheimdienst-auf-den-strassen-der-hauptstadt--8869578.html,https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/erschossener-georgier-in-berlin-kalter-krieg-reloaded/24953354.html,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/27/german-police-suspect-second-skripal-case-man-shot-dead-park/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin,https://news.yandex.ru/story/Za_ubijstvo_kistinskogo_avtoriteta_arestovali_fiktivnogo_sibiryaka--40ec57cdec8842a7e3777a1009c52573?from=newswizard&lang=ru&persistent_id=72472592&rubric=incident&stid=geXcPCcTFFCFuthWVMCZ,https://vz.ru/world/2019/8/26/994412.html,https://emc.org.ge/en/products/emc-zelimkhan-khangoshvilis-ojakhs-samdzimars-utskhadebs,https://oc-media.org/georgian-national-chechnya-russia-war-veteran-killed-in-berlin/,https://www.apnews.com/RamzanKadyrov,https://vk-smi.ru/strana-i-mir/162515?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru%2Fnews;Russian Media Push a “Chechen Revenge” Version in the Berlin Assassination – Contradicting Facts and Logic;;;;;;

Issues related to implementation and compliance, as well as any measures for violations, are equally applied to all nations and the athletes representing these nations.Switzerland -- Russian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov addresses the assembly at the opening of the 2017 edition of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Annual Symposium in Lausanne, March 13, 2017The “Lausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport”, adopted on February 4, 1999 in Switzerland, later provided the basis for The World Anti-Doping Code, as well as the creation of the independent international anti-doping authority – the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).The first code was approved in Copenhagen, Denmark in January 2003 at the World Conference on Doping in Sport.Current signatories to the code include the world Olympic movement, national anti-doping agencies, as well as organizations and nations outside of the Olympic Movement. Russia’s state anti-doping agency (RUSADA), Russia’s National Olympic Committee, and Russia’s Paralympic Committee are also signatories.The Russian foreign minister did not give any details supporting his “power battles” claim, but two doping-related processes could have laid the groundwork for the conspiracy theory.EmbedshareRT Claims WADA ‘Failed’ to Collect Data from Moscow Lab.

When the first code was adopted in 2003, WADA said it is “committed to ensuring that the code would be a living document, subject to periodic review.”In February 2006 and November 2011, WADA’s Foundation Board initiated review processes with amendments incorporated within the 2009 and 2015 codes, respectively.RUSSIA -- Aleksandr Zubkov of Russia carries the national flag as he leads the team during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, February 7, 2014The review process is transparent, the three-phase action plan is publicly available, and multiple draft versions of the proposed amendments have been circulated for discussions.The WADA Foundation Board also published the names of the seven experts chosen for the code drafting team.

304;;;;False;Xie Feng;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/hong-kong-pelosi-violence-fact-check/6742208.html;Pelosi Accused of Applauding Hong Kong Violence Over Tiananmen Candle Vigil Praise;2019-08-18;polygraph;William Echols;"On August 15, the commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Xie Feng, accused opposition protesters and “violent extremists” of attempting to overthrow the government. Xie said the protest movement, which arose in response to proposed amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition law [that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to China], was an attempt to undermine the “one country, two systems” model giving the region a large degree of autonomy. ​The commissioner also accused some countries of “grossly” interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs, referencing threats of canceling Hong Kong’s economic and trade privileges and sanctions against SAR officials.​Xie was referring to the proposed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, a U.S. congressional resolution which, among other things, would require the Secretary of State to determine (on an annual basis) “whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify special treatment by the United States for bilateral agreements and programs.”​Protesters gesture as they chant ""no extradition"" as they rally against a controversial extradition law proposal in Hong Kong on June 9, 2019.Xie then continued attacking what he considered “groundless accusations” lobbed at Chinese authorities.""They have told blatant lies, applauded violence as 'a beautiful sight to behold', made unfounded allegations against the Hong Kong police, groundlessly accused Beijing of 'encroaching on Hong Kong people's autonomy and freedom',"" he said.Regarding the alleged statements in support of violence, Xie repeated comments made by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has provided her support to the proposed human rights and democracy act. But Pelosi’s “beautiful sight to behold” remarks were not made in reference to clashes that have accompanied the Hong Kong protests. Speaking on the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Pelosi praised Hong Kong as “the only place in China where people are able to speak out.”After being shown a picture of a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong’s Victoria Square, where tens of thousands of people had peacefully gathered to pay their respects to the victims of the Tianamen Square massacre, Pelosi said:“It is a beautiful sight to behold and I commend the courage of the people there for speaking out in light of China’s actions in Hong Kong these days…”As for Beijing “encroaching on Hong Kong people's autonomy and freedom',"" it is not clear what Xie was referencing. However, in a 2017 State Department report the Chinese central government’s alleged “encroachment on the SAR’s autonomy” was counted among the “the most significant human rights issues” facing Hong Kong.That dispute was in part sparked by an interpretation of Hong Kong Basic Law, which underpins the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government.The Basic Law carries with it provisions that guarantee Hong Kong residents human rights and freedom of speech, assembly and association.In November 2016, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee — China’s top legislative body — voted unanimously on an interpretation of the basic law that disqualified two pro-independence legislators from Hong Kong’s Legislative council for making anti-Chinese statements while taking their oaths of office. 30th anniversary of the crackdown at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, in Hong KongA report issued by an advisory body to the U.S. Congress at that time accused Beijing of taking “additional steps toward undermining Hong Kong’s legal autonomy.”The following year, the lawmakers’ bid for reinstatement was rejected by Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal. Xie also accused certain western politicians of frequently meeting with “radical activists calling for so-called ‘Hong Kong independence’,"" likely in reference to a US diplomat who publicly met with members of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.A pro-Beijing newspaper responded by leaking personal information about that diplomat, including the names of their children, prompting U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus on August 8 to liken Beijing’s behavior to that of a “thuggish regime.”On August 9, Ortagus tweeted: “Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country.""She added: “Foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”While some aspects of Xie’s comments are open to debate, Polygraph.info finds his characterization of Pelosi’s comment to be false.";https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3289/text,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/15/c_138311974.htm,https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/6419-2/,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/calls-china-face-ghosts-its-past-tiananmen-anniversary,https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/6419-2/,https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china-includes-tibet-hong-kong-and-macau/china-includes-tibet-hong-kong-and-macau-hong-kong/,https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/facts/index.html,https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2043768/chinas-top-body-lays-down-law-hong-kong-oath-taking,https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2173243/beijings-encroachment-hong-kongs-freedoms-could-erode-its,https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2108243/ousted-hong-kong-lawmakers-baggio-leung-and-yau-wai-ching,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/us-calls-china-thuggish-regime-for-singling-out-us-diplomat-in-hong-kong-idUSKCN1UY2IM;Pelosi Accused of Applauding Hong Kong Violence Over Tiananmen Candle Vigil Praise;;;;;;
305;;;;Misleading;RIA Novosti;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-nuclear-submarine-disinformation/6742206.html;Two Decades on, Russian State Media Omits Facts About the Kursk Submarine Disaster;2019-08-15;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;In a feature article headlined “The Death of the Nuclear Submarine Kursk,” the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti chronicled the disaster which occurred 19 years ago, leaving a permanent stain on Vladimir Putin’s presidency.The Oscar II class nuclear submarine Kursk (PL850) sank on August 12, 2000 in international waters of the Barents Sea while taking part in an exercise of Russia’s Northern Fleet. All 118 people on board were declared dead after the two-week-long rescue operation proved unsuccessful.Russia -- FILE -- Captain 1st class Gennady Lyachin (R) reporting on successfull completion of the assignement on October 19, 1999.Russia’s initial decision to not accept any foreign aid in the first, most critical days of the rescue operation was widely assessed as the main error leading to the deaths of the entire crew and on board personnel observing the exercise.The decision was attributed to Vladimir Putin, then only six months into his first presidential term. Putin has been harshly criticized, both in Russia and abroad, for mismanaging the disaster response. Putin, who was reportedly spending time at a Black Sea resort when news of the disaster broke, only returned to Moscow on August 19, when he told the nation that hopes for saving any of the Kursk crew were fading.The disaster captured global headlines at the time and was meticulously documented, providing material for several bestselling books as well as the 2018 movie, Kursk, produced by the French company, EuropaCorp.The recent RIA Novosti account of the tragedy omits the same facts that Russian state media were prohibited from reporting at the time of the disaster. These omissions include immediate offers of assistance from the U.S., U.K., and Netherlands, as well as the fact that Russia had initially refused any foreign aid.“Britain, the U.S., and Norway offered publicly and, reportedly, through backchannel communications to aid in location and rescue efforts. In a move that would mar the early days of Putin’s leadership, the Northern Fleet waited until Wednesday — four days after the Kursk sank — before accepting any help from foreign powers. Norwegian and British rescuers wouldn’t arrive until that Saturday, a week after the accident,” the Intercept, an investigative outlet, reported in May 2019, citing the NSA archives leaked by a former subcontractor Edward Snowden.The facts RIA Novosti’s report conveniently omits are the same that the observers say were most damaging to Vladimir Putin’s reputation, even two decades after the tragedy.The AP archive footage of the meeting between the Russian State rescue committee and the relatives of the Kursk team members on August 15, 2000 exemplifies how the Russian state handled the crisis.“The only reason they are not rescued yet is because you want to save the submarine, but not the people, we all know that,” a woman can be heard shouting in Russian.The footage shows the forced sedation of a crew member’s mother, followed by the removal of all foreign journalists from the meeting by uniformed personnel with Russian police and military insignias, assisted by men in civilian clothes.On August 22, Putin met with the relatives of the dead crew members in the small city of Vidyayevo, which hosts naval bases.Speaking over the angry shouts from the hall, Putin claimed that no Russian or foreign rescuers were technically capable of reaching those on board the submarine in time.That assessment has been refuted by experts.“If Putin had accepted Western offers of aid right away, it is certainly plausible that a combination of Norwegian, British, and American forces could have opened the submarine in time to rescue the handful of survivors. After all, it took the Norwegians only a few hours to open the rear escape hatch of the Kursk once they were finally permitted to begin their salvage mission,” Mark Kramer, a Harvard University professor wrote in a PONARS memo in September 2000. Putin only approved rescue aid from Norway and the U.K. a week after the Kursk sank, when it was too late to save the lives of those on board.“As for the Russian government's response to the disaster, the deluge of unabashed lies and disinformation reveals something more than just a temporary bout of panic, to which almost any leader can succumb,” Kramer wrote. “It reveals the engrained Soviet mentality of so many of the officials whom President Vladimir Putin has brought to power, especially those from the internal security apparatus, which Putin formerly headed. Unable to deal with an emergency, they resorted to a Soviet-style cover-up.” Two decades later, Polygraph.info finds that Russian state media is continuing to mislead the Russian public on the Kursk tragedy.RUSSIA -- Relatives of the deceased crew of the Kursk nuclear-powered submarine attend the memorial ceremony on the 19th anniversary of the Kursk submarine tragedy at the Serafimovskoye cemetery in St. Petersburg, August 12, 2019;https://ria.ru/20190812/1557340444.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/02/opinion/l-chronicle-of-the-kursk-205397.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/16/kursk.russia,https://www.rferl.org/a/kursk-disaster-putin-turning-point-russia/27184505.html,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44483081?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/12/otd-kursk-aug-12-a66818,https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/russia-submarine-kursk-norway-nsa/,https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/5987384-remembering-the-kursk-the-view-from-norway/,https://www.express.co.uk/news/history/1150991/putin-news-russian-submarine-kursk-colin-firth-david-russell,http://www.ponarseurasia.org/sites/default/files/policy-memos-pdf/pm_0145.pdf,https://www.dsa.no/dav/3b3a226c34.pdf;Two Decades on, Russian State Media Omits Facts About the Kursk Submarine Disaster;;;;;;
306;;;;misleading;Rossiya-24;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-moscow-protest-concert-fact-check/6742204.html;Russian State TV Puts Out Hit Piece on Moscow Opposition Protest;2019-08-14;polygraph;William Echols;"On Saturday, August 10, tens of thousands of people took the streets of Moscow in the largest wave of demonstrations to hit the Russian capital since the so-called 2011 Snow Revolution.Police said that 20,000 people attended the latest in a weeks-long series of protests against the banning of opposition candidates from Moscow municipal elections set for September 8.The independent White Counter NGO, which monitors crowd sizes at demonstrations, put that figure at between 50,000-to-60,000.Russian-state television network Rossiya-24 dispatched correspondent Yaroslav Krasienko to cover the event.Focusing on attendees whom he described as “gypsies, homosexuals, ecologists, communists, supporters of empire, and defrauded real-estate investors,” Krasienko cherry-picked from man-on-the-street interviews to paint the rally as a “farce” attracting politically-disinterested music fans, adolescents, the homeless and non-residents of Moscow.A meeting on Sakharov Avenue in MoscowQuestioning the credibility of video and photo documentation showing police violence against protesters, Krasienko speculated in his report that all of the “emotionally charged” digital evidence was nothing more than masterfully staged propaganda.The report included speculation that a foreign adversary which is well-experienced in staging such provocations and is seeking to destroy Russia had planned and funded the event.While the Rossiya-24 report is in and of itself a textbook example of propaganda and disinformation, Krasienko’s focus on the music as one of the main pieces of evidence that the protests were neither political, nor organic, does not stand up to scrutiny. Krasienko ignored the increasingly politicized nature of hip-hop in Russia, the artists who performed at the opposition rally and the political aspirations of younger Russians, many of whom have lived their entire lives under Russian President Vladimir Putin.Protesters at the August 10 protest rally, the largest in a recent series of protests against the banning of opposition candidates from Moscow municipal elections set for September 8.It can not be discounted that some young people had come out to watch popular musicians perform, although that does not preclude political involvement, Tanya Lokshina, the Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Polygraph.info.The only people who could hear the performances were the “journalists and VIPs crowded by the stage,” Lokshina said. Due to the acoustics on Prospekt Sakharova, where the organized portion of the rally took place, as well as the last-minute leasing issues with equipment, “the sound system was terrible.”She said that younger people did not leave despite not being able to hear the music, which was regularly interspersed with speeches from opposition members. “[They] stayed on despite horrendous issues with the sound system,” Lokshina said.As for the performers, many have previously faced pressure from authorities, including concert cancellations and other forms of harassment, with rap music in particular increasingly being viewed as a new form of protest music in Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had noted a need for the state to “take control” of the genre.""Rap and other modern [forms of art] are rested upon three pillars - sex, drugs and protest,"" he said. ""I am most worried about drugs. This is the way towards the degradation of a nation.""As noted by HRW, across Russia between October-November 2018, “at least seven young performers, most of them rappers, had concerts cancelled under different pretexts or as a result of law enforcement raids.”Political IntentionsMeanwhile, the political intentions of those performing at the demonstration were made clear.Speaking from the stage, 21-year-old Ivan Dremin, who performs under the name Face, explicitly supported the goals of the opposition protesters, adding he “wasn’t an orator” and would simply sing his songs, which Krasienko, seizing on Putin’s comments, characterized as being about “narcotics”.Krasienko, however, did not mention the political themes present in Dremin’s music. One song, “Our Mentality,” includes lyrics about having never lived in a free Russia, judicial corruption and the 2018 World Cup being a pretext for large-scale graft.Another song refers to Russia as “one big prison camp.”Music critic Artemy Troitsky told the Moscow Times artists like Dremin represent a deepening political trend among young Russian artists.“The youth is not afraid of the authorities and they now vocalize the things they want to change in the country,” Troitsky said.Another rap performer, Oxxxymiron (aka Miron Fyodorov), had made explicitly political statements in calling on his fans to attend the August 10 demonstration, demanding the release of Yegor Zhukov, a Russian university student who was detained on suspicion of “organizing and conducting mass riots” during a July 27 opposition protest, although no such riots occurred that day. Nastya Kreslina and producer Nikolay Kostylev, who form the electronic duo IC3PEAK, have seen numerous concerts shut down in a censorship battle with Russian authorities. Apart from appearing at Saturday’s rally, IC3PEAK had performed at a protest calling for a free Russian internet earlier in the year.Krasienko also omitted the fact that the Russian authorities had scheduled their own “Meat&Beat” concert at Gorky Park to coincide with the August 10 protest, while also initially seeking to ban musical performances from the opposition rally.Authorities had previously rushed to arrange a festival called “Shashlik Live” on August 3, which corresponded with another demonstration for open and fair municipal elections.Analysts argue these so-called “spoiler concerts” are intended to draw people away from opposition rallies.Some performers had refused to take part in the state-organized concerts to express their solidarity with the protesters.Police violence and ‘human shields’After some of those in attendance broke off to march to the headquarters of Presidential Administration of Russia in the Kitai-Gorod area of Moscow, Russian security services arrested over 200 people.​Activist Olga Misik takes part in the August 10 rally in Moscow demanding that opposition candidates be allowed to run in the upcoming Moscow Municipal elections.Regarding that portion of the rally, Krasienko’s report focused on minor acts of jaywalking and traffic obstruction, while claiming the majority of young people were attracted by the “party” atmosphere and “adrenaline,” with “provocateurs and coordinators” leading them on. Krasienko brushed over acts of police violence, including the assault on Darya Sosnovskaya that has sparked public condemnation, and the detention of a physically-handicapped individual.Lokshina, who monitored that unsanctioned portion of the demonstration, said “those who were there for the walks and refused to leave despite watching their peers being detained were young.”Krasienko further stated that bringing young children to protests has become a new “trend.” He further argued that images of children, pregnant women and invalids at a peaceful rally being violently suppressed by security forces “are being used in the service of “the manipulation of mass consciousness.”Riot police officers detain a man during an unsanctioned rally urging fair elections in downtown Moscow on August 3, 2019.The focus on children in particular comes following a proposed law which would target parents who bring minors to unsanctioned protests, itself connected to conspiracy theories pushed by the Russian government that a “provocateur” had used a child as a “human shield” to escape arrest (a claim Krasienko has repeated). That alleged provocateur was Sergei Fomin, a volunteer at the election headquarters of opposition leader Lyubov Sobol, who filmed masked security officers bursting into her office to detain her prior to the August 10 rally.During an earlier protest on July 27, Fomin’s cousin Olga Prokazova was filmed handing her baby over to Fomin. Olga and her husband Dmitry faced losing custody of their child over that incident, with Dmitry rejecting the “human shield” conspiracy.“Sergey [Fomin] is my friend … he’s my wife’s cousin. I just asked him to carry the child. There were no cordons, no police – we all quietly went home together,” Prokazov told Radio Liberty.Sergey Fomin, a volunteer at the election headquarters of opposition leader Lyubov Sobol, has been charged with rioting after taking part in a July 27 opposition rally in Moscow, Russia.Fomin for his part has been charged with alleged rioting, despite the fact media, human rights organizations, and Putin’s own human rights council universally noted the non-violent nature of that protest.Clips repeatedly shown on Russian state media (including Krasienko’s report) attempting to implicate Fomin in the alleged unrest have shown nothing more than Fomin speaking, waving his hands or directing peaceful demonstrators on which direction to walk. Krasienko, in an earlier report about Fomin’s case, claimed that members of opposition leader Alexi Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation were wearing masks during police searches stemming from a recently launched money laundering probe which foundation members have called “an absurdity.”Opposition-minded Twitter users have noted that it was Russian security forces, and not members of the Anti-Corruption Fund, who were wearing masks during that raid.Krasienko’s reputation among protesters led to him being greeted with chants of “shame” during the August 10 rally, an event which he selectively edited and included in his own broadcast. ​Delegitimizing the Protests As previously reported by Polygraph.info, Russian authorities have gone to great lengths to delegitimize the latest wave of protests, both by blaming the demonstrators for the increased police violence and by falsely claiming Western involvement in the street demonstrations (which Krasienko touches on in his own report).

They're businessmen. When I asked if they were sure, they said we have friends who work in the security services, they convey it is so, that it happened while he was on holiday’.”Rubaev would later apologize to the relatives and people close to Berdimuhamedov, saying the Turkmen president’s death has not been confirmed. Radio Liberty’s Turkmen service also received information regarding Berdimuhamedov’ death on July 20, but was unable to confirm it despite numerous attempts.Reports of Berdimuhamedov’s death would later circulate to larger Russian media outlets, prompting a response from the Turkmen Embassy in Moscow, which called the claim an “absolute lie.” The Turkmen embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, likewise denied that Berdimuhamedov had died.TURKMENISTAN -- Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov poses with an ancient Akhal-Teke breed three years old studhorse, Begkhan, that won an International Annual Horse Beauty contest in Ashgabat on April 23, 2016.According to media reports, Berdimuhammedov went on vacation on July 15, amid rumors that his ailing mother had been sent to Germany for medical treatment. The BBC reported he had not been seen in public since July 5, having failed to meet with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, at a July 6 meeting in Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital.Currently, the fate of Berdimuhammedov remains unclear. While Turkmen state TV aired footage of him on July 21, that video is believed to have been filmed earlier, the Defense & Security Monitor blog reported. During an international health exhibition in Turkmenistan on July 20, a message attributed to Berdimuhammedov was read.Adding to the confusion, later, on July 23, Erkin Turkmenistan reported that the Turkmen leader had in fact fallen into a coma, with senior officials confident he was dead. That report said sources close to Berdimuhammedov later claimed he had recovered from that coma.On July 24, the press service for Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced Berdymuhamedov had “greeted our country’s leader on his birthday.”On the same day, Turkmen state TV broadcast previously unpublished images of the president. Other media outlets have suggested that he might not be dead, but likewise is suffering from health problems.The Moscow-based Fergana News Agency, which focuses on Central Asia, reported that “in the event of the president's death, they should not be expected to provide timely and reliable information” due to the strict media regulations in Turkmenistan.Reporters Without Borders called Turkmenistan an “ever-expanding news ‘black hole’” where the government controls all media and the internet is highly censored.The current situation is reminiscent of the 2016 death of Uzbekistan’s dictator, Islam Karimov, whose fate was speculated over for nearly a week before state television finally broke the news. underpinning the belief among analysts that authorities were attempting to manage the power transition in the authoritarian state. After the 2015 assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, Russian President Vladimir Putin disappeared for 10 days, sparking rumors about his own fate and the overall health of the Russian state. RUSSIA -- A monument to late Uzbek president Islam Karimov in unveiled in Moscow, October 18, 2018“Our political system is totally concentrated on the leader,"" the Christian Science Monitor quoted Nikolai Svanidze, a prominent Russian TV host and member of the Public Chamber of Russia, as saying at that time. “We do not have a reliable system of succession, so can you blame people for getting scared when Putin suddenly falls off the radar screen?”A similar dynamic appears to be at work in Turkmenistan related to the reports of Berdimuhammedov’s passing. RUSSIA --An elderly woman lays flowers at the site where late opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was fatally shot on a bridge near the Kremli, in central Moscow, February 27, 2019Jeff Mankoff, Senior Fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Polygraph.info that in a top-down system like the one in Turkmenistan, there are no institutions or accepted rules for leadership transition.“When Karimov died, a lot of his family were pushed aside, and having seen that up close, officials in Turkmenistan or anywhere else in Central Asia are not eager to see that history repeated,” Mankoff said. “So they want to put a transition plan in place before word leaks out.”Mankoff noted that when Berdimuhammedov’s predecessor Saparmurat ""Turkmenbashi"" Niyazov passed, the process by which he came to power was itself “very opaque.”“It was a stitch up behind the scenes where it seems that people in the elite were able to hash out a compromise of some kind and that’s why they settled on him,” Mankoff said.Despite the opaque media environment, Polygraph.info finds the Turkmen embassy's refutation that Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov has died to be likely true.";https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTV9QV8vZf_wpUPvFA1uP-w,https://govoritmoskva.ru/news/204756/?fbclid=IwAR3Y5cTKpbeitXkQy_PpqZGKVG5UG0k4GLSflI-1Mie4hp_vdvX5enry2k8,https://rus.azathabar.com/a/30067679.html,https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2019/07/21/n_13242661.shtml,http://kg.akipress.org/news:1557963/?from=kgnews&place=maincats,https://www.hronikatm.com/2019/07/mother-of-god/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37260375,https://eeas.europa.eu/regions/western-balkans/65289/high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-visited-ashgabat-sign-establishment_en,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r5eCztmoeY,https://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/news/1516,http://www.news-asia.ru/view/12613On July 24, the press service for Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced Berdymuhamedov had “greeted our country’s leader on his birthday.”,https://www.fergana.agency/news/109202/,https://rsf.org/en/turkmenistan,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2015/0316/Putin-s-disappearing-act-Was-he-just-trolling-everyone;Despite Rumors, Turkmen Leader Likely Alive;;;;;;

He has run as a candidate in nearly every Russian presidential election since founding the LDPR and registering it as the Soviet Union’s second political party (other than the Communist Party) in April 1991. For decades, Zhirinovsky has rated among Russia’s most popular politicians. According to the most recent poll (July 2019) by the state-owned VTsIOM polling agency, Zhirinovsky was Russia’s fourth most trusted politician, behind President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.EmbedshareResponding to a Threat Not Made, Russian Party Leader Menaced Ukraine’s ExistenceEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:250:00​Despite his high public trust ratings, Zhirinovsky is famous for making controversial, often inaccurate claims, as in the recent case involving Ukraine’s Oleksandr Turchynov.Turchynov did not say that it was “necessary” to blow up the Russian-built bridge that spans the Kerch Strait between the Black and the Azov seas, connecting Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Ukraine -- Secretary of Ukrainian Security and Defennce Council Oleksandr Turchynov (L) examines a machine-gun during a presentation of new small arms, designed and made in Ukraine, at a shooting range near the village of Novi Petrivtsi, near Kyiv, NovembIn a July 15 interview with the Ukrainian news portal LB.ua, Turchynov, who served as the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council under former president Petro Poroshenko, highlighted the country’s new Neptune mobile cruise missile system as a solution to Russia’s threat in the Black and Azov seas.“Our cruise missiles will be able to destroy Russian warships of any class not only in the Black and Azov seas, but also in their home ports, and, if necessary, to demolish the bridge, Russia brags about so much,” Turchynov said.Speaking of Russia’s military involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Turchynov said that 37,000 troops from Russia’s 8th Army were recently deployed to eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while another 33,000 were deployed to Crimea.EmbedshareRussian Media Outlet Claims Short Kerch Strait Ramming Video Was not EditedEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:00:540:00“From the East, we are threatened by the 8th Army, in reserve of which are the 49th [Army] and 58th Army of the Southern Military District; from the North, [we are threatened] by the 20th and 1st Panzer Army of the Western [Military] District,” Turchynov said. “To this potential, we need to add two more armies of aerospace forces, which are ready to support an offensive from the air, and six missile brigades deployed along our borders.”As a result, Turchynov said, Moscow is capable of marshaling a force exceeding 200,000 troops for an offensive against Ukraine within 24 hours.";https://wciom.ru/news/ratings/doverie_politikam/,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/07/4/4c/4c6491bb-d8dd-41b9-a8e6-e86d1d72887e_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-ukraine-crimea/6741051.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741051.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741051.html&text=Responding+to+a+Threat+Not+Made%2c+Russian+Party+Leader+Menaced+Ukraine%e2%80%99s+Existence,/a/6741051.html,/embed/player/Article/6741051.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://lb.ua/news/2019/07/15/432155_aleksandr_turchinov_dominiruet.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/12/e/ed/ed311103-980f-4b69-8d2f-a982edf669d0_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-ukraine-crimea/6740940.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html&text=Russian+Media+Outlet+Claims+Short+Kerch+Strait+Ramming+Video+Was+not+Edited,/a/6740940.html,/embed/player/Article/6740940.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True;Responding to a Threat Not Made, Russian Party Leader Menaced Ukraine’s Existence;;;;;;

God forbid, let them live as they wish. But some things do appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles. Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that. But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.”In response, the musician Elton John tweeted at the Russian president, writing he was “deeply upset” by the interview.“I strongly disagree with your view that pursuing policies that embrace multicultural and sexual diversity are obsolete in our societies,” John wrote, adding that he found Putin’s claim that he wanted LGBT people to “be happy” duplicitous.Putin responded to John, telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti the British musician was “mistaken.”​""We really have a very smooth relationship with members of the LGBT community –really calm, perfectly unbiased,” Putin said. ""We have a law which everyone scolds us for — the law banning propaganda of homosexuality among minors. But look, let us allow a person to grow up and become an adult first, and then decide who they are. Leave the children alone.""‘Cannot live as they wish’ Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, told Polygraph.info Putin's reassurances regarding the treatment of LGBT people in Russia came across as “hypocritical.”“In Russia, LGBT people cannot ‘live as they wish.’ Russia has a discriminatory ‘gay propaganda’ ban, which is a classic example of political homophobia by targeting vulnerable sexual and gender minorities for political gain,” she said.RUSSIA -- Activists from the local LGBT community put tape over their mouths while walking during a protest against discrimination in St. Petersburg, April 17, 2019​Lokshina said that while antipathy towards homosexuality and gender variance is not a new phenomenon in Russia, the “gay propaganda” law has increased social hostility.“[The law] also has a stifling effect on access to affirming education and support services, with harmful consequences for LGBT youth,” she said.The administrator of the New York-based but Russian focused online LGBTQ support group We Together, who for safety reasons asked to be identified as Lion Allenby, told Polygraph.info the Russian state’s attitude towards the LGBTQ community has also put sexual minorities at risk of attack, often with little legal recourse. RUSSIA -- Police officers detain a participant during a rally held by LGBT activists and their supporters on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in central Saint Petersburg, Russia May 17, 2019.“Russian law enforcement agencies accept [complaints] from LGBT representatives who register them, but there is no real consideration of the case, including prosecution for violence against LGBT people,” Allenby said. “Victims face obstacles in seeking justice. As a result of this attitude of the authorities, many homophobic attacks and crimes go unpunished.”Allenby told Polygraph.info he himself was the victim of one such attack.“In May 2018, six unknown people attacked me by the exit of a gay bar and broke my orbital bone (my eye was operated on and a titanium plate was implanted). A (criminal) case was not initiated despite my appeal and the available video recording of the attack, where the faces of the attackers are visible,” Allenby said.He added that his own café in the center of Moscow was targeted due to the fact it was mainly frequented by LGBTQ individuals.The culmination of these actions prompted Allenby to seek refuge in the United States. His refugee status was approved in May 2019.Surge in violence ​Allenby’s attack coincides with a statistical rise in hate crimes targeting Russia’s LGBTQ community.The Thomas Reuters Foundation reported in 2017 that hate crimes against LGBT people had doubled over five years, following the introduction of the gay propaganda law in 2013.“There was a dramatic spike in the attacks after the adoption of the law - 2013 was gruesome,” Lokshina said.That surge in violence was most visible in the formation of the so-called Occupy Pedophilia group, which, according to the Spectrum Human Rights Alliance, based in the Washington, DC area but internationally focused, recorded the torture and humiliation of men, primarily male teenagers, who had responded to same-sex personal ads on the internet.“These self-proclaimed ‘crime fighters’ perform their actions under the broad day light, often outside and clearly visible to a general public that indifferently passes by or even commends them,” the alliance wrote.Lokshina said fewer attacks on sexual minorities have been reported recently due to a government crackdown on ultra-nationalist groups.“However, many attacks apparently go undetected as the victims fear publicity. The overall climate is very hostile,” Lokshina said.For example, the neo-Nazi founder of Occupy Pedophilia, Maxim Martsinkevich, was sentenced in 2017 to 10 years in prison for inciting hatred and enmity, hooliganism, robbery and property destruction.However, Martsinkevich never faced prosecution for his attacks against gay men.RUSSIA -- Maksim Martsinkevich, also known as ""Tesak"" (Machete), charged with extremism, attends a court hearing in Moscow court, December 29, 2018​Reinforcing prejudice Allenby cited the targeting of Deti-404 (Children-404), an online group that offers psychological support, advice, and a safe online community for LGBT children, by the Russian state media watchdog Roskomnadzor as further proof of the state’s bias against the LGBTQ community.Russia -- Yelena Klimova, a journalist who runs the online support group, Deti-404 for LGBT teenagers, was charged under Russia's controversial law on promoting ""gay propaganda"" to minors.Experts say the ostensible desire to “protect children” has had the opposite effect.Testifying in Bayev and Others v. Russia, a case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that considered the legality of the anti-gay propaganda law’s curtailment of free expression, Ilan Meyer, an expert in social psychology and public health specializing in minority populations, said the legislation hurts minors.“Laws such as Russia’s propaganda law can have serious negative impact on the health and well-being of [LGBT people] in that the law increases and enshrines stigma and prejudice, leading to discrimination and violence,” Meyer said.The ECHR’s 2017 ruling in the case mirrored Meyer’s judgement, saying that such laws “reinforce stigma and prejudice and encourage homophobia, which is incompatible with the notions of equality, pluralism and tolerance inherent in a democratic society.”In August 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled that the application of a regional law in Russia against homosexual propaganda was ambiguous, disproportionate and discriminatory, violating articles 19 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights.RUSSIA -- Activists from the local LGBT community attend a May Day rally in St. Petersburg, May 1, 2019In a December 2018 report, Human Rights Watch said “lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth in Russia face formidable barriers to enjoying their fundamental rights to dignity, health, education, information, and association.”In January 2019, reports surfaced of gay purges in Russia’s Chechen Republic, where the state itself is believed to be behind the wave of violence that left at least two people dead. Russian law enforcement has been criticized for failing to respond to acts of intimidation and death threats against members of the Russian LGBT Network, which helped bring the latest wave of violence in Chechnya to light.Based on the rulings of international legal bodies, as well as the testimony of individuals and reports from human rights groups, Polygraph.info finds Putin’s claim of a “perfectly unbiased” attitude toward LGBT people in Russia to be false.";https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/07/c/c4/c4627250-2572-45dd-b58e-1e9a86c63447_mobile.mp4,/a/putin-elton-john-lgbt-russia-fact-check/6741045.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741045.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741045.html&text=Putin+Tells+Elton+John+Russia+%e2%80%98Unbiased%e2%80%99+Toward+LGBT+Community,/a/6741045.html,/embed/player/Article/6741045.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://www.ft.com/content/670039ec-98f3-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36,https://ria.ru/20190629/1556039905.html,http://www.facebook.com/groups/782940858710711/?ref=share,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-lgbt-crime/lgbt-hate-crimes-double-in-russia-after-ban-on-gay-propaganda-idUSKBN1DL2FM,https://sites.google.com/a/spectrumhr.org/www/hot-news-1/russianlgbtteenspubliclybulliedandtorturedbyneonazisonvideolocallawenforcementcondoneshomophobia,http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170627/279099672.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-lgbt-children-404-propaganda/26703500.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/12/russia-gay-propaganda-law-endangers-children,https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-174422%22]},https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR%2fC%2f123%2fD%2f2318%2f2013&Lang=en,https://www.polygraph.info/a/chechnya-gay-persecution-kadyrov/29740151.html,https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/28/russia-chechnya-gay-purge-responders-threatened;Putin Tells Elton John Russia ‘Unbiased’ Toward LGBT Community;;;;;;

The Russian diplomat did not elaborate on the details of the proposed “exchange” or name the U.S. citizens held in Russia who Moscow may be willing to swap.Ryabkov also called on the U.S. to “return” to Russia the “diplomatic property” that Washington “seized not only in violation of the Vienna Convention, but in violation of private right.”The deputy foreign minister did not specify the property to which he was referring. However, in December 2016 (under President Barak Obama), the U.S. government closed down two compounds used by Russian diplomats, one in New York state and the other in Maryland, charging they were used for espionage.The following year (under President Donald Trump), the U.S. government closed down a consulate in San Francisco along with two diplomatic annexes in New York and Washington in 2017.Ryabkov’s claim that the U.S. acted in violation of Vienna Convention is false.Vienna ConventionMore than a dozen of articles of the Vienna Convention detail the “receiving State’s” obligations to guarantee immunity to the diplomatic missions of the “sending State,” even in the cases of complete breakdown of the relations.For instance, Article 45 states: “If diplomatic relations are broken off between two States, or if a mission is permanently or temporarily recalled: (a) The receiving State must, even in case of armed conflict, respect and protect the premises of the mission, together with its property and archives.”However, in the case of U.S.-Russian relations, other articles of the Vienna Convention lay the groundwork for a receiving state’s lawful actions towards the diplomatic missions of a sending state. Article 2 of the Vienna Convention reads: “The establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent.”Article 11.1 says: “In the absence of specific agreement as to the size of the mission, the receiving State may require that the size of a mission be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the receiving State and to the needs of the particular mission.”Article 12 reads: “The sending State may not, without the prior express consent of the receiving State, establish offices forming part of the mission in localities other than those in which the mission itself is established.”According to a senior State Department official who spoke on background on September 15, 2017, the U.S. is “confident in the legality” of its actions.“The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations provides that consular posts are established only with the host state’s consent. The United States has withdrawn its consent for Russia’s consular post in San Francisco. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations does not prevent restrictions on location of Embassy buildings or annexes,” the official said.Two retired U.S. diplomats contacted by Polygraph.info said the U.S. actions did not violate the Vienna Convention.Ambassador Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that “the State Department has a legal justification for the closure of the properties.”John Herbst, director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, concurred.“Of course, the U.S. did not violate the Vienna Convention,” he said. “That convention does not give nations the right to own or lease property in another state with a view to commit espionage. To deny a nation a property to conduct espionage is not, therefore, a violation of the Vienna Convention.”Espionage under Diplomatic CoverageIndeed, when it comes to the use of diplomatic missions for espionage, Article 41.1 of the Vienna Convention says: “Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State.”In addition, paragraph 3 of Article 41 reads: “The premises of the mission must not be used in any manner incompatible with the functions of the mission as laid down in the present Convention or by other rules of general international law or by any special agreements in force between the sending and the receiving State.”According to former and current U.S. intelligence officers, Russia has used the diplomatic privileges of its U.S. missions for espionage over the years. The now-closed Russian consulate in San Francisco was of a specific concern to U.S. intelligence because it served as the base for Moscow’s espionage efforts on the U.S. Pacific coast. A 2017 investigation by Foreign Policy magazine, headlined “The Secret History of the Russian Consulate in San Francisco,” revealed “an intensive, sustained, and mystifying pattern of espionage emanating from the San Francisco consulate.”;http://valdaiclub.com/events/posts/articles/hard-security-or-small-steps/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-01/moscow-presses-u-s-to-swap-russian-pilot-for-american-in-russia,https://ria.ru/20190701/1556088047.html,http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf,https://www.state.gov/achieving-parity-in-diplomatic-missions/,https://www.state.gov/expulsion-of-russian-intelligence-officers-holding-russia-accountable/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/14/the-secret-history-of-the-russian-consulate-in-san-francisco-putin-trump-spies-moscow/;Top Russian Diplomat Falsely Claims U.S. Actions Violated Vienna Convention, Calls White House Policy ‘Schizophrenic’;;;;;;

Zakharova was referring to the 24 Ukrainian sailors who, along with their three ships, were captured by Russia last November while heading to the Kerch Strait, the only passage between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov via international waters.In her Facebook post, Zakharova accused Kyiv of using the sailors to “blackmail” Russia while “caring nothing” about their fate.The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published a piece on Zakharova’s Facebook comments with the headline: “Kyiv has refused to discuss the question of the release of the sailors, said Zakharova.”While Zakharova is right that Russia sent a note to Ukraine regarding the captured sailors, she mischaracterized what Russia actually proposed in the note, as well as the controversy more generally.On May 25, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is an inter-governmental organization established by the United Nations, ordered Russia to “immediately release” the 24 Ukrainian sailors and three ships without any preconditions.On June 25, Russia’s Foreign Ministry sent notes to Ukraine and to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea concerning actions it was taking in response to the tribunal’s May 25 order. While the ministry did not make those notes public, on June 26 it posted a statement that included some details of Moscow’s proposal. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the notes it sent to Ukraine and the tribunal “draw attention to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the 24 Ukrainian sailors are ongoing, as well as to the possibilities available under the criminal procedure legislation of the Russian Federation with regard to sailors and ships that may be at this stage involved by the Ukrainian side in order to release them.”EmbedshareRussian Media Outlet Claims Short Kerch Strait Ramming Video Was not EditedEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:00:540:00Responding to the Russian Foreign Ministry note, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Moscow of failing to comply with the May 25 order by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It said the Russian Foreign Ministry note contained “a cynical proposal to provide the Ukrainian side with written guarantees of Ukraine's participation in the continuation of the criminal prosecution of Ukrainian sailors in accordance with Russian law.”The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry added that it considered “this proposal by Russia unacceptable and aggravating the dispute between Ukraine and Russia regarding the immunity of warships.” It also demanded, “that Russia, without any further conditions, comply with the Order of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and immediately release the captured 24 Ukrainian sailors.”Russia, however, is refusing to comply, insisting the international rules do not apply to this case.Moscow insists that it captured the Ukrainian ships last November while they were “violating Russian territorial waters.” Polygraph.info has examined that claim and found it to be false. In comments to Polygraph.info, U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said Russia’s capture of the Ukrainian ships and sailors in international waters last November violated international law, and that their continued detention is illegal.He also noted that a U.N. court (ITLOS) had ruled against Russia and demanded the immediate release of the sailors.Volker said Russia’s “offer” to Ukraine to participate in the criminal investigation of the sailors was an affront to justice, since there was no basis to detain them in the first place, as well as an affront to the U.N. and Ukrainian sovereignty.On June 27, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin posted the scanned copies of the Russian and Ukrainian notes on his Facebook page. The Kyiv Post translated Klimkin’s post from Ukrainian to English, explaining that he had decided to share the diplomatic notes to clear up any questions and to reveal Russia’s “hidden motives,” calling Moscow's note a “trap.”Instead of implementing ITLOS' decision, Klimkin said that Russia aims to:""require us to admit that our sailors could commit a crime""""persuade us to recognize the lawfulness of the judicial process against them under Russian law""""invite us to bend over to the criminal procedure code of the Russian Federation, and at the same time indirectly recognize the occupation of Crimea.""";https://www.facebook.com/maria.zakharova.167/posts/10219916839221047,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-coast-guard-rams-ukrainian-tugboat-official-denies-fact-check/29622245.html,https://ria.ru/20190627/1555969583.html,https://www.itlos.org/cases/webcast/webcast-archives-case-no-26/,https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_284_En.pdf,http://www.mid.ru/web/guest/maps/ua/-/asset_publisher/ktn0ZLTvbbS3/content/id/3701462,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/12/e/ed/ed311103-980f-4b69-8d2f-a982edf669d0_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-ukraine-sailors/6740940.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html&text=Russian+Media+Outlet+Claims+Short+Kerch+Strait+Ramming+Video+Was+not+Edited,/a/6740940.html,/embed/player/Article/6740940.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://mfa.gov.ua/ua/press-center/news/73448-komentar-mzs-ukrajini-z-privodu-nevikonannya-rosijeju-nakazu-mizhnarodnogo-tribunalu-z-morsykogo-prava?fbclid=IwAR3tUBrSWT3_bYddkMfywDNvoYHkW4xMEQaYsxL2cP_cpLPNEx36cULdHAY,https://www.polygraph.info/a/eight-putin-claims-regarding-kerch-strait-fact-check/29626830.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-propaganda-azov-crisis/29637568.html,https://www.facebook.com/pavloklimkin.ua/,https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/klimkin-posts-russias-note-ukraines-response-on-ukrainian-sailors-in-social-network.html;Russia Did Not Offer to Free Ukrainian Sailors it Captured;;;;;;

The piece, headlined “The Chernobyl Series –Radioactive Propaganda,” was accompanied by a Soviet-era cartoon vilifying the Voice of America, the U.S.-government international broadcaster. The relationship between that cartoon and the HBO series is not clear.The Regnum article claimed the miniseries “is packed with petty anti-Soviet filth, which poisons viewers’ brains, thus becoming a deliberate, well-thought-out distortion of Soviet reality.”That claim is false.The HBO miniseries “Chernobyl” is a dramatization of the 1986 nuclear disaster in Soviet Ukraine, one of the worst man-made catastrophes in history. The series, which has become a global phenomenon since its release on May 6, has been highly praised for its accurate presentation of the events before, during and after the disaster.Adam Higginbotham, author of the book, ""Midnight in Chernobyl,"" told CBSN the production design was ""extraordinary.""“They are clearly aiming to offer a drama accountable to fact rather than merely exploit the setting to hang a fictional story,” wrote Carl Willis, who teaches nuclear engineering classes at the University of New Mexico and is a frequent visitor to Chernobyl, in a review of the series.The Belarussian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, who was initially skeptical when Chernobyl’s creators asked for permission to use material from her book “Voices from Chernobyl,” also spoke highly of the series.Ukraine -- Svetlana Alexievich, Nobel Prize in Literature laureate, attends a press conference for the presentation of her book ""Chornobyl's prayer"" in Kyiv, April 7, 2016 ""We are now witnessing a new phenomenon that Belarusians, who suffered greatly and thought they knew a lot about the tragedy, have completely changed their perception about Chernobyl and are interpreting this tragedy in a whole new way. The authors accomplished this,” Alexievich said.Chernobyl’s writer, creator and executive producer, Craig Mazin, said Alexievich’s review was “the best” the miniseries had received. HBO released the following statement:“Craig Mazin began researching the Chernobyl disaster in 2014, using a wide variety of materials, including several books, government reports from inside and outside of the Soviet Union and first-person accounts. He spoke to nuclear scientists to learn how a reactor works and interviewed former Soviet citizens to gain a better sense of the culture in 1986.”Russian filmmaker Michael Idov tweeted after watching the first episode that there had not been “a single false note,” adding “it is embarrassing - to me as a Russian cultural producer - to watch HBO do the very memory work Russian pop culture has abdicated.”In a Twitter thread, the Times of London’s Moscow correspondent, Tom Parfitt, compiled reviews of how people in Russia have reacted to Chernobyl:“Inside Russia, people have been watching it on an HBO partner site or on high-quality pirate sites. Responses range from bilious via perceptive/valid criticism to liberal praise.”The series’ popularity in Russia sparked a reaction from state and Kremlin-friendly media.“It seems every major Russian media outlet had to chime in about the ’Chernobyl’ TV series by HBO,” the Moscow Times correspondent Ilya Shepelin wrote in his analysis of the reaction of Russia’s pro-government media to the series. “Although the foreign program airs only online to paying viewers, the show has become something of a national sensation in Russia, where the pro-Kremlin media have launched a mini-crusade against it.”One of Russia’s most popular pro-government TV channels, NTV, announced in June that it plans to air its own Chernobyl series, which will suggest that a CIA saboteur was behind the disaster. Production of that series began in 2018.The NTV Chernobyl series reportedly has received Russian-government support via a $460,000 grant from the Ministry of Culture.Reflecting on the tonal shift in reviews of HBO’s “Chernobyl” inside Russia, Svetlana Alexievich blamed the change of opinion on the Kremlin. ""In the beginning, Russian media was very positive about the series and then probably there was some yelling in the Kremlin and they suddenly became very patriotic,” she said. “Then there was news they are launching their own series about Chernobyl, about how 'our' agents pursue some American spy at the power plant. My God, when I read all this I thought, that 30 years have passed and has really nothing changed in the consciousness?""EmbedshareRussian Politician Calls HBO Chernobyl ‘Anti-Soviet Filth’, Falsely Accuses Producers of DistortionEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:150:00";http://regnum.ru/news/2646720.html,http://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Chernobyl-Greatest-Nuclear-Disaster-ebook/dp/B07GNV7PNH/?tag=cnet-cbsnews-20,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chernobyl-disaster-how-accurate-is-the-hbo-series/,http://www.quora.com/Is-Sky-and-HBO-s-miniseries-Chernobyl-historically-accurate?share=1,http://www.rferl.org/a/belarusian-nobel-laureate-says-hbo-series-has-completely-changed-perception-of-chernobyl/29997496.html,http://www.hbo.com/content/hboweb/en/chernobyl/about.html,http://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/06/04/putins-media-struggle-to-deal-with-hbos-chernobyl-a65866,http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2043248/,http://www.voanews.com/europe/russian-tv-series-blames-cia-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster,http://www.rferl.org/a/belarusian-nobel-laureate-says-hbo-series-has-completely-changed-perception-of-chernobyl/29997496.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/06/3/30/30a0bfe5-0bde-4c7b-9a29-c23f12ab3d5d_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-hbo-chernobyl/6741036.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741036.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741036.html&text=Russian+Politician+Calls+HBO+Chernobyl+%e2%80%98Anti-Soviet+Filth%e2%80%99%2c+Falsely+Accuses+Producers+of+Distortion,/a/6741036.html,/embed/player/Article/6741036.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True;Russian Politician Calls HBO Chernobyl ‘Anti-Soviet Filth’, Falsely Accuses Producers of Distortion;;;;;;

RSF described Crimea and Chechnya as “’black holes” from which little news and information emerges.Also in 2014, Amnesty International found that the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly in Russia had long been only partial and often involved risks for critics of the government.Meanwhile, Russian government internet watchdog Roskomnadzor also attempted to block the Telegram messaging app in April 2018 for refusing to give Russian security services access to users’ encrypted messages.Ironically, that ban has been flouted, by, among others, Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov and RT editor in Chief Margarita Simonyan.It is also illegal in Russia to distribute images of President Putin wearing makeup, while sharing social media memes can lead to criminal prosecution. Meanwhile, Google faced suspension for identifying Crimea as Ukrainian territory.U.K. -- Protesters wearing masks of Russia's President Vladimir Putin pretend to kiss as they take part in a demonstration against the country's 'anti-gay' laws outside the Embassy of the Russian Federation in London, February 14, 2014.Those examples, coupled with Golunov’s detention and a host of other acts of violence meted out against journalists, prove Kiselyov’s claims regarding free speech in Russia to be demonstrably false.;https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/06/6/60/608c373f-9a3d-4034-8b1b-281ae66162e8_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-ivan-golunov-press-freedom-russia/6741034.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741034.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741034.html&text=Rossiya+Segodnya+Head+Falsely+Touts+Russia+Press+Freedom+Bona+Fides,/a/6741034.html,/embed/player/Article/6741034.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/06/07/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-arrest-of-meduza-correspondent-ivan-golunov,https://meduza.io/en/short/2019/06/09/who-dominated-russian-social-media-sites-on-june-8,https://meduza.io/en/news/2019/06/08/moscow-court-orders-house-arrest-for-ivan-golunov-investigators-asked-for-two-months-in-jail,http://tass.com/politics/1063112,https://meduza.io/en/news/2019/06/11/ivan-golunov-to-be-cleared-of-all-charges,https://rsf.org/en/russia,https://rsf.org/en/russia,https://reestr.rublacklist.net/visual/,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-signs-fake-news-legislation/29828242.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-sovereign-internet-great-firewall/29768477.html,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2013/12/18/internet-extremism-bill-passes-first-duma-reading-a30613,https://amnesty.org.ru/node/3063/,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/04/26/kremlin-spokesman-still-uses-telegram-despite-ban-a61278,https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/europe/russia-gay-clown-putin/index.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-faces-criminal-probe-social-media-memes/29410323.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/google-russia-crimea-is-ours-russia/29759895.html;Rossiya Segodnya Head Falsely Touts Russia Press Freedom Bona Fides;;;;;;

During his speech before parliament, Zelenskiy said his first task would be to end the war in Donbas, which has resulted in the deaths of 13,000 people and wounding of more than 30,000 others.UKRAINE -- Volodymyr Zelenskiy receives presidential symbols from Natalia Shaptala, Chairman of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, during his inauguration ceremony at the parliament in Kyiv, May 20, 2019That statement was met with a standing ovation. “History is not fair, that's true. It wasn't us who started this war, it wasn't us. But it's our job to end it. And we're ready for a dialogue,” Zelenskiy said.The head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, used the Telegram messaging service to express discontent with Zelenskiy’s statement, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.Kadyrov said Zelenskiy’s inauguration speech had likely been “edited abroad,” otherwise he “would not be making belligerent statements on the first day” of his presidency “threatening to seize the territory of a neighboring state.”CHECHNYA -- Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov speaks in front of a portrait of his father Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen president who was assassinated in a 2004 bomb blast, during a meeting in Grozny, May 10, 2019The Chechen leader was referring to the Crimean peninsula, which he said ""was, is, and forever will be an integral part of Russia.""Polygraph.info has repeatedly checked false claims that Russia is not occupying Ukrainian territory.UKRAINE – Russian soldiers march outside an Ukrainian military base in Perevalne, Crimea, March 20, 2014.But did Zelensky threaten to take any territory, neighboring or otherwise, by force?The Ukrainian president did say that, after ending the war in the Donbas, the next challenge was “the return of [Ukraine’s] lost territories,” adding that it was “impossible to lose something that rightfully belongs to us.”“Both Crimea and [the Donbas region] are Ukrainian lands. We didn't just lose the territories, we lost the most important thing: the people,” Zelensky said.That opinion was backed up by the March 27, 2014 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262. It stated that the Russian-led referendum to annex Crimea, carried out under military occupation, had “no validity” and “cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.”The resolution urged all countries “not to recognize any alteration of the status” of Crimea, which the majority of the international community has adhered to.While Zelenskiy spoke of winning back the “conscience” of the people in those areas whom the government had failed to make “feel Ukrainian,” he did not suggest “seizing” Crimea or otherwise regaining the peninsula via military action.

Reuters is showing a green boulevard. Q.E.D.”Q.E.D. is an abbreviation for quod erat demonstrandum used to demonstrate the completion of the proof.Closer examination shows that Simonyan’s “proof” is untenable. The time stamp on her Telegram post shows 9:38 AM (UTC).However, the live feed was not just a “green boulevard” but Reuters’ live stream showing escalation of street protests during the May Day rally in Paris, France.Simonyan’s post indirectly accuses Reuters of not covering the situation in Venezuela, which is also false – the reports from Caracas are on the top of the “World News” section of the Reuters website.Polygraph.info has reviewed recordings of the Reuters live channel fed to affiliates. The channel streamed protests in Venezuela on Tuesday, April 30 from approximately 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT, on the day that massive street protests broke out in the country.On Wednesday, May 1, Reuters streamed hours of live coverage of street protests in Paris, which turned violent.

Kremlin.

Still, as I understand it, the Chinese comrades are implementing American sanctions. How much do we understand their true intentions?”Peskov responded by repeating the Kremlin line -- that the international sanctions are “illegal from the point of view of international law.” That is what is false in Peskov’s the interview on Vesti.ru. Polygraph.info has previously examined and debunked that claim.EmbedshareDid China Join Sanctions Against Russia?EmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:090:00Richard Cooper, professor of international economics at Harvard University, told Polygraph.info: “Russia's invasion and absorption of Crimea certainly violated international law -- the United Nations was established to avoid such aggressive takeovers -- so sanctions against that do not violate international law.”RUSSIA -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin look at containers of food as they visit an exhibition during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018Peskov also said that China did not join the international sanctions, but that is only partly correct. Beijing has not imposed its own sanctions against Moscow: on the contrary, it has occasionally criticized such restrictions.Still, Beijing’s public rhetoric may be different from its actual practices. On the one hand, the sanctions against Russia have benefited China, which has invested billions of dollars in the Russian economy while Russia is largely ""off-limits"" to Western investment.On the other hand, China last year became a target of U.S. sanctions for making deals with blacklisted Russian entities, specifically for violating the ban on purchasing Russian military equipment.""Formally, Peskov's statement is correct,"" Ander Aslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council told Pograph.info in an email. ""But the four big Chinese state banks have all refused to provide Russia with financing from July 2014, when the US imposed its financial sanctions, so China looks first of all to its own interests with regard to the U.S., and thus implements U.S. sanctions on Russia, while not imposing sanctions of its own.""China -- Vladislav Masalov, (L) the Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company (SCAC) President and chairman of China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation Limited (CRAIC), takes the business license from Chen Xuejun (C), Chief of Shanghai Administratio“I think Peskov is couching a difficult reality,” Michael Kofman, senior research scientists at CNA Corporation told Polygraph.info. “China does not support sanctions, particularly secondary sanctions which are seen as extra-territorial, but on the other hand the major Chinese state banks are complying with them.”Peskov, himself, further commented half-admitting that businesses in China, including government entities, comply with sanctions.“Yes, many Chinese banks, economic structures – they are forced to regard with caution these restrictions adopted by the Americans and other countries, because we live in an era of mutually-dependent economies. So, our Chinese partners often display caution, but that does not mean they are supporting these sanctions,” he said.Kofman, also a senior fellow at the Wilson Center, put the reaction of Russians in perspective: “Some Russians joke that Chinese banks are more afraid of U.S. sanctions, and comply with them more stringently, than Europeans. So there is the political reality, and then there is the de facto Chinese compliance with U.S. sanctions which I suspect results in considerable consternation in Moscow.""";https://tass.ru/politika/6386668,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-sanctions-illegal-claim-fact-check/29613539.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/05/4/4f/4f2236e0-5480-43bb-88c6-535219bc43c0_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-china-sanctions/6741019.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741019.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6741019.html&text=Did+China+Join+Sanctions+Against+Russia%3f,/a/6741019.html,/embed/player/Article/6741019.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-china-idUSBREA2C0PB20140313,https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/06/news/economy/russia-china-investment-deal-sanctions/index.html,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/politics/russia-china-sanctions-caatsa-state-dept/index.html;Updated: Did China Join Sanctions Against Russia?;;;;;;

The Afghan people are being abused. And there is no clear end to it.”The Pentagon maintains approximately 14,000 personnel in Afghanistan for “Operation Freedom’s Sentinel,” tasked with helping the Afghan government “to support and sustain its forces.”Kadyrov cited the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UANAMA) “Quarterly Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict: January 1 to March 31,” which was released on April 24.The report does not provide data on drug trafficking in Afghanistan.As Kadyrov noted, the UN data shows “significant increases in civilian casualties from aerial and search operations, which drove an overall increase in civilian casualties by pro-government forces.”“Between 1 January and 31 March 2019, UNAMA attributed 608 civilian casualties (305 deaths and 303 injured) to Pro-Government Forces, representing a 39 percent increase from the same period last year. UNAMA notes with concern that Pro-Government Forces were responsible for more civilian deaths than Anti-Government Elements during the first quarter of 2019,” the report states.AFGHANISTAN -- Cars are loaded with the bodies of civilians who were allegedly killed in a military operation by the US forces, in Zurmat district of Paktia province, December 31, 2018The breakdown of the data demonstrates that UNAMA attributed 17% of civilian casualties to the Afghan national security forces, 13% to international military forces, two percent to pro-government armed groups, and two per cent to multiple pro-government forces.However, the UN report does not confirm Kadyrov’s claim that “around 400 civilians have died through the fault of the U.S. troops and the forces of official Kabul enlisted by them.” In fact, a total of 305 civilians were killed as a result of actions by international forces, Afghan government forces and pro-government forces taken together. International forces alone were responsible for 146 deaths.The U.S. currently accounts for some 14,000 of the roughly 17,000 troops from 39 countries on the ground in Afghanistan as part of the NATO’s mission “Resolute Support.”So, Kadyrov is right in pointing that anti-government forces in Afghanistan account for fewer civilian deaths than the pro-government side. However, Kadyrov’s overstatement of the numbers and his tendency to overly attribute the numbers to the U.S. earns our verdict of “misleading.”;http://www.voanews.com/a/three-us-service-members-one-contractor-killed-in-afghanistan/4867091.html,http://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_-_first_quarter_report_2019_english.pdf,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48047356,http://rs.nato.int/about-us/mission.aspx;Is the U.S. to Blame for a Majority of the Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan?;;;;;;

During the Soviet action 14 people lost their lives.A Lithuanian demonstrator runs in front of a Soviet Red Army tank“[In January 1991] open and large-scale systematic military aggression against the civilian population was initiated and pursued in order to provoke unrest and armed conflict. The pretext of such a conflict, using [Soviet] military force, was further part of the plan to overthrow the power of the (democratically) restored Lithuania, to introduce [Soviet power] and to continue the occupation and annexation of Lithuania,” the court ruled.All but two of the defendants were sentenced in absentia, most of them facing prison terms of four to 12 years. The court sentenced the former military chief in charge of the clampdown to 12 years in prison. All will be appealed to a higher court.LITHUANIA -- Russian citizen and former Soviet military official, Yury Mel (C) takes part in a hearing in the trial over Moscow's deadly 1991 Soviet crackdown on the Baltic state's independence movement, in a regional court in Vilnius, March 27, 2019Moscow, which refused to cooperate with the three-year-long trial, called the proceedings illegal.The Russian Claims The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed “the basic principles of law were violated, most importantly that of inadmissibility of retroactive application of law,” Russian state outlet RT reported. “The evidence proving that Soviet officers were not involved in civilian deaths on that tragic day has been ignored.”On April 10, the Russian Investigative Committee launched a probe into the judges presiding over the case for ""delivering a deliberately wrongful sentence.""In an opinion piece for the Russian state news agency TASS published on April 11, Alexander Guschin, an associate professor in the Department of Post-Soviet Countries at Russian State University for the Humanities, agreed with the Investigative Committee that the verdict handed down by the Lithuanian court was “illegal.”The Russian citizens in question, Guschin wrote, “are being judged under the laws of independent Lithuania, while in January 1991 Lithuania was still one of the Soviet republics.”His argument was that since Lithuania was not independent at the time and “not recognized by the international community,” the “actions of the Soviet special forces and the army to end the unrest were legitimate.” We dig into this claim.Lithuania’s Jurisdiction Asked about Guschin’s contention that the deaths had resulted from Soviet security forces being deployed to quell public unrest and were thus not crimes against humanity, Rebecca Hamilton, an assistant professor of law at American University in Washington DC, told Polygraph.info that such an argument is “not frivolous,” although it would depend on the material facts of the case.Lithuania -- Commemorating the victims of the Soviet aggression of 13 January 1991, people place lit candles in the shape of the Columns of Gediminas outside the Ministry of Education and Science in Vilnius, January 12, 2017Hamilton said that it was not unreasonable that a Lithuanian court would look into the facts of the case and make an assessment, although “conducting a trial in absentia is problematic.”Two critical issues in adjudicating that claim will therefore rest on Lithuania’s jurisdictional claim, the nature of the Soviet response during the so-called January events, and whether those crimes constitute crimes against humanity, as determined by the Vilnius Regional Court.LITHUANIA -- A boy stands near Lithuanian soldiers during a celebration of Independence day at Independence Square, in front of the Parliament Palace in Vilnius, March 11, 2019Crimes Against Humanity – International Law As it stands, there is no internationally recognized, comprehensive convention covering crimes against humanity.Article 7 of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, defines “crimes against humanity” as certain “acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.”But Russia (along with the United States) withdrew its signature from that statute. Lithuania, by contrast, is a state party to the Rome statute.In any case, Rasa Jukneviciene, a member of the Lithuanian parliament, Lithuania’s former defense minister and president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, told Polygraph.info that the actions of the Soviet soldiers do constitute crimes against humanity, “as it is foreseen by international law.”“Their actions in January 1991 were recognized as crimes against humanity. Even if such actions had been carried out somewhere in Moscow or St. Petersburg, they would still be the crimes against humanity,” she said.Lithuania -- A dead Lithuanian pro-independence supporter has his eye opened by one of his comrades before being taken away in Vilnuis, January 13, 1991The Fact Check – Based on Jurisdiction As for the jurisdictional claim, Lithuania’s case appears solid.Under the principle of universal jurisdiction, for which the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts, both states and international organizations can claim criminal jurisdiction over the accused regardless of where the crime was committed.Hamilton told Polygraph.info that apart from universal jurisdiction, there is also the “traditional basis of jurisdiction” – in which the crime happened on your territory.Erika Leonaite, an assistant professor of International Law and Human Rights at Vilnius University, told Polygraph.info the case was in fact based on territorial jurisdiction, as crimes were committed on Lithuanian territory, in 1991, “nearly a year after Lithuania has restored its independence.”“One of the consequences of the illegal occupation and annexation of Lithuanian territory by the Soviet Union in 1940 was that, from the point of view of international law, Lithuania de jure never became a part of USSR (similarly as Crimea does not constitute part of Russian Federation under international law, even though it is annexed by Russia). Thus, the crimes were not committed on ‘Soviet territory,’” she said.Leonaite refers to the March 11, 1990 Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, which resulted in the Baltic nation being the first Soviet state to declare its independence from the Soviet Union.Then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev called the move illegal and Soviet authorities demanded the act be rescinded.As a result in January 1991, pro-Kremlin forces, backed by the Soviet military, tried to reassert Moscow’s authority, with the deadly results.Lithuania -- Lithuanian demonstrator stands in front of a Soviet Red Army tankOf the 14 people killed and 843 injured during the January Events, as they became known, thirteen died on January 13, when Soviet paratroopers stormed the television center and tower, breaking through a human shield. Witness accounts said some victims were crushed by tanks while others were shot to death. Video footage further appeared to corroborate those accounts.One of the defendants convicted in absentia, Mikhail Golovatov, the former deputy commander of the KGB's elite anti-terrorist Alpha Group, stated in a written deposition that former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev had given the green light to dispatch special forces to Vilnius.Gorbachev was summoned as a witness but declined.But he told Deutsche Welle that he ""never gave on order or sanctioned in any other way the use of army units in Vilnius.""SOVIET UNION -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, right, and Vice President and politburo member Anatoly Lukyanov, at the podium during the opening session of Supreme Soviet of Russian at the Kremlin, Moscow, May 16, 1990""As president of the USSR, my only position was to use all political means to preserve the unity of the country,"" Gorbachev said in a written response to DW. ""I stress — only political means. We were ready for talks. It would have been enough for the Lithuanian leadership to suspend its independence declaration. Compromise was possible, but it was rejected.""Ultimately, the Soviet attempt to reassert control of Lithuania failed. Lithuania officially became independent in August 1991. The dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred soon thereafter.The Fact Check – Crimes Against HumanityLeonaite said that the classification of crimes against humanity was based on the fact that the “military attack was knowingly directed against civilians” and exercised by Soviet authorities with the aim of keeping Lithuania in the USSR.The civilians present at the time, she said, were unarmed and not violent – according to witnesses and even the Russian soldiers. Lithuanian police officers were unarmed.“In addition, Russian soldiers in their testimonies said that although they were authorized to use lethal force in self-defense only, no such conditions were present, and the shootings committed by soldiers were spontaneous,” she said. “Only several Russian soldiers adhered to the version of events, now fiercely argued by Russia, that some shots were fired from the top of a near-by building. However, no further evidence to support this claim was established.”Based on these circumstances, Leonaite said that both the general context (“armed attack against a sovereign state”) and the particular circumstances (“military force and equipment used vs. peaceful massive gathering”) leaves the Soviet response outside the realm of “even a robust ‘law enforcement operation’.”On the question of whether Soviet Special Forces acted “legitimately” to end “the unrest,” Vaidas Saldžiūnas, defense editor at DELFI, concurred with Leonaite, telling Polygraph.info that Guschin’s claims are baseless. “There was no unrest to begin with, not from the Lithuanian side anyways,” said Saldžiūnas. He added it was supporters of the Soviets who “attempted to storm the parliament (that was elected in democratic elections and voted for independence). Then Soviet forces attempted intimidation tactics (moving heavy armor onto the streets during the night). Then they stormed (police and media facilities) just before January 13th when the bloody Sunday happened.""SOVIET UNION -- LITHUANIA -- (FILES) A woman demonstrates in Moscow on January 13, 1991 protesting against the Soviet army crackdown against the nationalist Lithuanian authorities. Demonstrators are passing by the KGB building (aka Lubyanka). Lithuania waAs to Guschin’s claim that Lithuania was not recognized by the international community as being independent, the argument rests on Lithuania’s legal status at the time. Moscow argued that Lithuania joined the Soviet Union of its own volition in 1940 while Lithuania insists the country was occupied.Lithuania -- A group of Lithuanians attempt to stop a Soviet Red Army tank from crushing a fellow protester during the assault on the Lithuanian Radio and Television station in Vilnius, 13Jan1991Writing in the University of Notre Dame’s Journal of Legislation, William Webb noted that no international fact-finding body has ruled on the legality of the annexation of Lithuania, though he argues that, given the historical evidence, any such body would likely “find the annexation to have been without the consent of Lithuania, and thus illegal.”Webb, who was writing before Lithuania gained independence from the Soviet Union, noted that for the inclusion of Lithuania into the USSR to have been legal, the Soviet Union could not legally do so unilaterally. With the Soviet Union in all likelihood having “acted unilaterally” in conducting a fraudulent 1940 annexation referendum, Webb said it was “axiomatic” that the USSR had no right under international law to incorporate Lithuania.Lithuania – European Human Rights RulingIn a related case lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, Lithuanian citizens convicted for their role in attempting to re-assert Soviet authority argued they had been prosecuted for offenses which could not have been foreseen at the time due to the tenuous political situation.Lithuania’s argument revolved around the claim that Soviet rule was illegitimate, that the country “only restored sovereign power to the Lithuanian Government” as the Soviet Union dissolved and that “international recognition had a retroactive effect.”In that case, the court ruled that “the applicants were convicted for crimes which were sufficiently clear and foreseeable under the laws of the re-established Republic of Lithuania,” backing Lithuania’s jurisdictional claims.Ultimately, Jukneviciene argues that the Russian challenge is intended to put Lithuania “in a futile dispute about the legitimacy of our state,” adding the occupation question was settled long ago.“It is a pity that similar crimes that had been carried out by Soviet army in Baku, Tbilisi and elsewhere have not been legally assessed. Lithuania has finally done this and it shows the maturity of our country.”Soviet Soldiers in Vilnius, Lithuania during the 1991 January events.Our VerdictWith the Soviet occupation of Lithuania never being internationally recognized, Lithuania’s jurisdiction to adjudicate crimes against humanity under universal and traditional jurisdiction, and the evidence pointing towards a state-sponsored effort to use force to crush a peaceful protest, Polygraph.info finds Guschin’s claims that the Soviet Special Forces acted legitimately “to end the unrest” to be false.";https://www.rferl.org/a/lithuania-russia-soviet-crackdown-verdict/29844540.html,https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/delfi-skaitytojams-isskirtine-galimybe-susipazinkite-su-nuosprendziu-1991-m-sausio-ivykiu-byloje.d?id=80843017,https://www.rferl.org/a/lithuania-russia-soviet-crackdown-verdict/29844540.html,https://www.rt.com/russia/454986-lithuania-trial-foreign-ministry/,https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1332668/,https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/human_rights_vol31_2004/winter2004/irr_hr_winter04_universal/,https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lithuania-proclaims-its-independence,https://www.dw.com/en/the-january-bloodbath-in-lithuania-25-years-on/a-18976152,https://www.dw.com/cda/en/lithuanias-trial-of-the-century-implicates-soviet-leader-gorbachev/a-48065740,https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1402&context=jleg,http://file:///C:/Users/wechols/Downloads/001-85152.pdf;Moscow Lashes Out at Lithuanian Criminal Convictions of Soviet Officers;;;;;;
321;;;;Misleading;Sergey Lavrov;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-nato-libya-russia/6742112.html;Did NATO Cause the Crisis in Libya?;2019-04-10;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;Commenting on latest escalation of fighting in Bengazi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of causing the crisis, claiming Libya’s problems with terrorism, weapons smuggling and illegal immigration began “precisely” after the NATO intervention in 2011. Opinions about the effect of NATO’s seven-month operation in Libya vary from praising the intervention as “highly successful” to condemning it as a “catastrophic failure.”Yet, even the harshest critics agree NATO’s involvement in Libya did not cause that country’s deterioration: it was already in a civil war, with the UN and Arab League warning the regime could commit mass atrocities amid Muammar Gaddafi’s vows to “cleanse Libya.” Thus, Lavrov’s claim that NATO caused Libya’s crisis is misleading.The legal basis for NATO’s intervention is also in dispute.The United Nations University (UNU) wrote in a 2011 analysis: “Whenever States decide to use force against another State, whether individually or as a group, the first question that arises is whether such an action is pursuant to the right of self-defense (Article 51 UN Charter) or is one authorized by the Security Council. In the case of Libya, Article 51 does not apply, as Libya had not attacked any NATO member State. It therefore follows that only an authorization by the Security Council could provide a sound legal basis for any military action against Libya and keep NATO action from being in violation of UN Article 2(4). The question is: Was NATO action in Libya authorized?”UN Security Council Resolution 1973 of March 11, 2011 created a no-fly zone over the whole of Libya. This was done in order to help protect civilians. The Security Council called on “Member States that have notified the Secretary-General and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, to take all necessary means to enforce compliance with the ban on flights imposed by paragraph 6.”The UNU analysis noted: “Thus far, NATO could not have legally responded to the Security Council’s mandate issued to ‘regional organizations and arrangements’ in Resolution 1973 because, by virtue of its own treaty, the alliance is neither such an organization, nor one that could be held bound by either Article 53 or Article 54 of the UN Charter. And since NATO acted in Libya collectively, in contradistinction from acting nationally, the latter caveat in the mandate does not save NATO from being in violation.”The UNU analysis concluded that the Libya operation revealed a “gap between the law –­ UN Chapter VIII provisions — and NATO’s increasing policy of responding to Security Council resolutions and the Security Council’s silent reception of NATO’s generosity. It would be disingenuous, to say the least, to argue that NATO should not assist in implementing Security Council resolutions just because the alliance is not one of the organizations that could adhere themselves to the enabling mandates with any legal exactitude.”Critics argue that NATO wrapped up Operation Unified Protector and left Libya when the country was still in a state of political chaos. In reality, NATO followed the UN Security Council’s resolution ending international military operations in Libya on October 31, 2011.;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/the-latest-italian-minister-concerned-over-libya-escalation/2019/04/05/5cab6aaa-579b-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html?utm_term=.736452a267e7,http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/31iht-eddaalder31.html,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/libya-war-saving-lives-catastrophic-failure,http://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10200.doc.htm,http://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/04/12/everyone-says-the-libya-intervention-was-a-failure-theyre-wrong/,http://unu.edu/publications/articles/assessing-nato-s-involvement-in-libya.html,http://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10200.doc.htm,http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/71679.htm,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15481143;Did NATO Cause the Crisis in Libya?;;;;;;

We have looked closely many times. A few of our fact checks:UKRAINE – Election poster depicting a Ukrainian soldier with a sign reading 'Go for vote, we protect you,' during the president elections in Mariinka, near a contact line not far from Donetsk, March 31, 2019​Kremlin Falsely Claims Russia not Occupying Ukrainian TerritorySputnik Blames Airspace, not Russian Missile, for MH17 DowningDoes Russia Bear Responsibility for War in Ukraine?For years, Moscow has categorically denied being a party to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, whether through sending troops or arms to fuel the conflict.But the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.Igor “Strelkov” Girkin, a leading “self-defense” commander in Crimea and later commander of separatist forces in eastern Ukrainia, told Zavtra newspaper in November 2014 that he “was the one who pulled the trigger of this war.”""If our unit hadn't crossed the border, everything would have fizzled out — like in [the Ukrainian city of] Kharkiv,” he said.""There would have been several dozen killed, burned, detained. And that would have been the end of it. But the flywheel of the war, which is continuing to this day, was spun by our unit. We mixed up all the cards on the table,"" he said, referring to the Russian paramilitary forces under his command.Along with Girkin, other key military and political leaders in the self-proclaimed separatist “republics” were Russian citizens, including the first “Donetsk People’s Republic” leader Alexander Borodai, “Donetsk People’s Republic “Sparta” Battalion leader Arseny “Motorola” Pavlov, Rusych militia leader and neo-Nazi Alexei Milchakov.UKRAINE – Ukraine – Citizens of Russia, Col. Igor Girkin (also known as Igor Strelkov) and Alexander Boroday (R) - the leaders of the group ""DPR"", which in Ukraine is recognized as a terrorist. Occupied Donetsk, July 10, 2014And, as Polygraph.info previously reported, in spite of numerous denials, the evidence of Moscow’s involvement in the Donbas war is overwhelming and has been confirmed by numerous open-source investigations, journalistic investigations by international and Russian media outlets, and even, at times, by Russian officials.Specific “smoking gun” evidence includes:The presence of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine neither produced by, nor purchased by the Ukrainian armed forces, such as the T-90A main battle tanks;The “separatists’"" continued access to large quantities of advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them;A Vice report which proved the presence of Russian serviceman of the 37th Motorized Infantry Brigade (Kyakhta) operating in eastern Ukraine. Later, Russia adopted an “anti-selfie soldier law"" which might have prevented such public evidence;And, a wealth of open source intelligence (OSINT) produced by groups such as Bellingcat and Inform Napalm demonstrating Russian military movements in Ukraine.On May 24, 2018, the Dutch Joint Investigative Team (JIT) presented its findings on the system that shot down the passenger airliner MH17, which was flying over eastern Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The JIT determined the missile system had been provided from Russia and identified the military unit it belonged to – the Russian armed forces’ 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade. On April 4, the family of the sole American victim of the MH17 downing sued Russia's Sberbank and VTB Bank and the Western Union Co., Western Union Financial Services, MoneyGram International, and MoneyGram Payment System for allegedly providing services to Russian backed separatists. The suit is based on a 1992 U.S. anti-terror law that allows U.S. victims of terrorism to sue those who provide material support to those carrying out the attacks.EmbedshareSputnik Blames Airspace, not Russian Missile, for MH17 DowningEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:340:00​Based on the evidence available, the International Criminal Court in November 2016 determined that the war in Ukraine was a Russian invasion and not, as Russia claimed, a civil war.

These are small ships but they are our own and new,” Argat said.Gurza-M class boats are small armored artillery boats used to patrol harbors, rivers, lakes, territorial waters and isolated areas. Other missions include protection of Ukraine’s borders and river ports, assistance to aircraft or vessels in distress, and combating illegal migration, piracy and smuggling on the Danube River and in the waters of the Black Sea-Azov basin.Centaur-class fast assault craft are used to provide fire support and ensure the rapid deployment of marines and Special Forces. They can also perform a wide range of missions, including maritime patrol, surveillance, search-and-rescue (SAR), safeguarding littoral and inland waters, and troop transport.‘Laughable NATO training’NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last December that “NATO is helping with different trust funds on cyber, on command and control and we also help to modernize the Ukrainian navy,"" including by providing intense training to the Ukrainian navy.NATO support for Ukraine is regulated under the Wales Summit Declaration of September 2014, which was followed by four declarations ensuring and enhancing NATO support for Ukraine.NATO members, including the United States, United Kingdom and others, have regularly held enhanced training exercises with Ukrainian troops, including from the Ukrainian navy.According to the Military Times, from July to September 2018], the U.S. Marine Corps “kicked off three training evolutions with partner forces in Ukraine, Romania, and Georgia.”Interactive Liveuamap portal shows the activities of the NATO and Ukrainian navy, including the joint NATO-Ukraine drill: Matka-class missile boat ""Pryluky"" (U153) and Halifax-class frigate HMCS Toronto (FFH 333) held in July 2018.In September 2018, Ukraine’s navy reportedly conducted joint training with the USS James E. Williams destroyer.​‘NATO deliveries… in essence, junk’“NATO does not provide ships to Ukraine,” the alliance’s press office told Polygraph.info, noting that NATO member states are independently providing vessels to the Ukrainian navy.In 2017, Ukrainian Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko said that Ukraine’s navy is looking into the purchase of decommissioned NATO ships for its fleet in order to fulfill Ukraine’s role in occupying a significant portion of the Black Sea coastline.Denmark, Lithuania, Poland, Tanzania and the United States have sold or rebuilt -- or are in the process of negotiating the delivery of military vessels -- to Kyiv.Listed among Ukrainian Navy active vessels are:One Danish Flyvefisken Class multirole vessel. Built in Denmark between 1987 and 1996, decommissioned in 1989. The Flyvefisken Class multirole vessel is based on a modular concept, using a standard hull with containerized weapon systems and equipment, which allows the vessel to change roles quickly for surveillance, surface combat, anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures/minehunter, minelayer or pollution control.The Pereyaslav, a Muna Class small reconnaissance ship built in Lithuania. Originally named GS-13 in the Soviet Navy. Launched in 1986 and transferred to Ukraine in 1995.Seven Polish ships, including the U-602 Alchevsk, a Moma Class intelligence ship; the U401 Yuri Olefirenko, a Polnochny-C Class a mid-size landing ship; three PO-2 Class training ships; the U-811 Balta, a Bereza Class degaussing ship; and the U-500 Donbas, an Amur Class command/SAR ship.Two U.S. Island Class patrol cutters. As described by the Military Navigator portal, “[t]he 110-foot Island-class Patrol Boats are a Coast Guard modification of a highly successful British-designed patrol boat. With excellent range and seakeeping capabilities, the Island Class, all named after U.S. islands, replaced the older 95-foot Cape-class patrol boats. These cutters are equipped with advanced electronics and navigation equipment.”Two U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry Class guided missile frigates have been offered to Ukraine, and Ukrainian Navy sailors have been training on them in the United States.John Herbst, American diplomat, director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasian Center in Washington DC'Propaganda' and 'False'John Herbst, director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and former U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan (2000-2003) and to Ukraine (2003-2006), told Polygraph.info, Koshkin’s statement is “propaganda.””The ships that we have been able to provide to Ukraine are coast guard cutters; they are real ships, not junk, they will be of serious use to Ukraine’s navy. So, these statements are simply false,” Herbst said.Herbst said that Moscow’s claim of ownership over parts of the Black Sea, including the Kerch Strait, are “in complete violation of international law.” Russia is only one of the Black Sea powers, which also include several NATO nations, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, all of which have navies.“It is true that NATO has taken a more forward presence in the Black Sea in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine, but I am not expecting NATO nations to challenge the Kremlin in the Kerch Strait, but I do expect a greater NATO presence in the east of the Black Sea.”Koshkin, like many in Russia, called NATO’s aid to Ukraine a “provocation” and threatened a strong response by Moscow.“Mr. Putin is a bully; he becomes more aggressive when he sees weakness,” said Herbst.He added that the Kremlin voiced the same threats when the U.S. announced it would provide Ukraine with the Javelin anti-tank missile system.

That followed a decree issued last September not to extend the agreement.The treaty, signed in 1997, obliged Russia and Ukraine to ""respect the territorial integrity of each other and confirm the inviolability of current mutual borders.”The accord will officially expire on March 31.Moscow’s attempt to portray Ukrainian authorities as manufacturing Russian aggression in order to “violate the rights of their own citizens” is disingenuous.Cluster warheads in Illovaisk township, Donetsk region. Russian forces are believed to have played a decisive role in the Battle of Ilovaisk, which started on August 7, 2014.Russia clearly violated the treaty with its invasion, occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014, followed by its use of force to control parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine.The Russian takeover of Crimea in February 2014 began when Russian special forces, operating without national insignia, seized the Crimean parliament building and raised the Russian flag.UKRAINE – Russian soldiers march outside an Ukrainian military base in Perevalne, Crimea, March 20, 2014 The bloodless invasion by the “little green men” resulted in Russia taking control of the peninsula.Igor “Strelkov” Girkin, a leading “self-defense” commander in Crimea and later commander of Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukrainian, admitted in a 2015 interview that members of the Crimean parliament were herded into a chamber at gunpoint and forced to support the annexation.The referendum in Crimea, hastily carried out under Russian military occupation, did not allow for public debate or for political leaders from greater Ukraine to visit the peninsula. And, in accordance with Ukraine’s constitution, all Ukrainian citizens should have been allowed to vote in the referendum, not only residents of the peninsula.Further undermining the referendum’s validity were the two options on the ballot, each of which made it impossible for Crimea to maintain the status quo.On March 27, the United Nation General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, which stated that the referendum, “having no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.” The resolution urged all countries “not to recognize any alteration of the status” of Crimea.Apart from violating the Friendship Treaty, the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea also violated post-Soviet agreements Russia signed ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders, including the 1991 Belovezha Accords and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.In Eastern Ukraine, Polygraph.info reported there was overwhelming evidence of Moscow’s involvement in the so-called “separatist” war in the Donbas, launched after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.Leaders of the so-called “civil war” were Russian citizens, the presence of Russian “volunteers” in the country is well-documented and Russian military technology, never purchased by Ukraine, was found.The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that Moscow’s actions in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine constitute an international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Ukraine -- A man stands in front of his destroyed house in the town of Debaltseve, north-east from Donetsk, March 13, 2015As Polygraph.info previously reported, the ICC used the word “crime” to describe the conflict in 2016. The war in Donbas has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister on European and Euroatlantic Integration, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, recently said that Ukraine did not terminate the treaty earlier so that Kyiv could file suit against Russia on the “basis of the violations of the treaty committed by Russia.”""And this means that all these violations, such as the illegal annexation [of Crimea], and the invasion of eastern Ukraine, and this attack and aggression in the Black Sea-Azov region, in the Kerch Strait, all these things are documented and are grounds for us to sue the Russian Federation,"" the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN cites Klympush-Tsintsadze as saying.EmbedshareRussian Media Outlet Claims Short Kerch Strait Ramming Video Was not EditedEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:00:540:00In light of Russia’s clear and repeated violations of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Polygraph.info finds Moscow’s claim that Kyiv is responsible for the breakdown of bilateral relations to be false.";http://tass.com/politics/1048439,https://www.rferl.org/a/poroshenko-signs-law-terminating-ukrainian-russian-friendship-treaty/29648193.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-crimea-land-grab/29496991.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/crimean-annexation-baltic-state-independence/29221929.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-crimea-land-grab/29496991.html,http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/262,http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/belovezha-accords-25-years-ago/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-violated-the-budapest-memorandum/28985642.html,http:// https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-ukraine-russia-donbas/28912097.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2016/11/20/international-criminal-court-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-is-a-crime-not-a-civil-war/#395d01737ddb,https://www.polygraph.info/a/is-russia-a-guarantor-of-stability-and-security-fact-check/29811254.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/eight-putin-claims-regarding-kerch-strait-fact-check/29626830.html,https://www.unian.info/politics/10477659-ukraine-s-deputy-pm-explains-why-friendship-treaty-with-russia-not-terminated-ahead-of-time.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/12/e/ed/ed311103-980f-4b69-8d2f-a982edf669d0_mobile.mp4,/a/russia-ukraine-friendship-treaty/6740940.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740940.html&text=Russian+Media+Outlet+Claims+Short+Kerch+Strait+Ramming+Video+Was+not+Edited,/a/6740940.html,/embed/player/Article/6740940.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True;Moscow Falsely Accuses Ukraine of Violating Friendship Treaty;;;;;;

While being processed for deportation, they are to be held in detention at a center for the temporary placement of foreign citizens in the town of Gulkevichi.Soviet poster: ""A struggle against religion is a struggle for socialism""On March 7, a higher court for the Krasnodar region denied an appeal filed by the two Americans against the Novorossiysk court’s decision.“While the two men are reportedly in good condition and are being treated well, we are troubled by the circumstances surrounding their detention,” Hawkins said.Russian officials have been quoted supporting the claim that the two American Mormon missionaries violated the conditions of their Russian visas.For example, the mayor of Novorossiysk said there are no ""Mormon meetinghouses"" in his city.The state-owned RIA Novost news agencyi reported last April that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had announced the construction of its first temple in Russia. There are reportedly some 23,000 people identifying themselves as Mormons in Russia, and the group is registered with Russian authorities as a religious organization.RUSSIA – Picture taken on November 29, 2008 shows a Russian Orthodox icon that includes a depiction of Soviet Dictator Josef Stalin at a St. Olga's Church outside St. Petersburg.The head of the missionary department of the Ekaterinodar and Kuban dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Church, Dmitry Kravchenko, said his church is “very concerned” about the Mormon presence in the Krasnodar region. “They begin with English lessons. These guys, as a rule, come from the United States; they are native speakers, which is how they attract, but after a few lectures they start including some religious topics in their texts,” Kravchenko said.Yet the Russian authorities accused the two Americans of doing exactly the opposite - of giving English language lessons while their declared purpose for visiting Russia was “religious.”The issue, however, is more complex. “These guys did not violate either Russian law or the entry/stay regulations,” Alexander Verkhovsky, director of Sova-Center, a Moscow-based NGO, told Polygraph.info in a phone interview. “Unfortunately this story is very typical – a lot of religious activists have been deported from Russia based on this particular pretext.”He added: “The official version was that they violated the declared purpose for their visit, which was religious activity, by giving English language lessons. But per our information, they only participated in an event where English was a working language.”The Russian attorney representing the two Americans, Sergey Glizunza, said the official evidence that they were “teaching English” was based on the testimony of a minor girl, who said that the Americans spoke with her in English “on various topics.”Verkhovsky said deporting foreign religious activists on the basis of similar accusations has become a “persisting practice” in Russia. “It is not aimed against any particular ‘foreign’ religion – they’ve deported a lot of Protestants, rabbis and others, of course, with the exception of the Russian Orthodox Church,” he said.Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) speaks with Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill during a visit to St. Sergius of Radonezh Cathedral in Tsarskoye Selo, outside St. Petersburg, December 8, 2014Agents of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) are tasked with monitoring foreign religious groups, but they “don’t really understand what they are doing” so they “just go after anything they deem suspicious.”While this was reportedly the first recent incident involving the Mormons in Russia, other congregations have been targeted and persecuted.Most notably, in 2017 a Russian court designated the Jehovah’s Witnesses as an “extremist organization” and banned them from Russia the following year.The main evidence used to accuse the Jehovah’s Witnesses of “extremism” was “forensic expertise” involving the group’s translation of the Bible into Russian.The Russian experts concluded that the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ translation of the Bible into Russian amounts to a “justification for the necessity of overthrowing the constitutional order in the Russian Federation,” since the Jehovah’s Witnesses “believe in the depravity of the existing state of affairs, the coming end of the world, the victory of Jesus over the devil, and the beginning of a new world order.”The Russian experts also concluded that the Jehovah’s Witnesses' translation of the Bible includes “calls for violating Russia’s territorial integrity” because the Jehovah’s Witnesses “believe in the inevitability of the end of the world and the coming of new rulers.”Russia- A pro-government organization ""Nashi"" hounds Jehovah witnesses -- 27Jan2019";http://novorossisk-primorsky--krd.sudrf.ru/modules.php?name=sud_delo&srv_num=1&H_date=02.03.2019,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2019/03/1/12/12459ba5-9f6f-4c67-adc8-449262c347b5_mobile.mp4,/a/fact-check-russia-detains-american-mormons/6740998.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740998.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740998.html&text=Russia+detained+two+Americans+For+allegedly+violating+the+terms+of+their+visas,/a/6740998.html,/embed/player/Article/6740998.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,http://ria.ru/20190307/1551613135.html,http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/6196304,http://https://tass.ru/obschestvo/6196674,http://ria.ru/20180403/1517846030.html,http://tass.ru/obschestvo/6196866,http://https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/6195888,http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/6195888,/a/28421009.html,/a/29663600.html,http://www.sova-center.ru/religion/news/extremism/counter-extremism/2017/08/d37666/;Did the Two American Mormons Detained in Russia Violate Russian Law?;;;;;;

Our national idea is power, arrogance and rudeness,” Serebryakov said.Creating a “Russian national idea” has been a key part of Putin’s presidential agenda since his coming to power nearly two decades ago. “Patriotism is the Russians’ holy duty. That is our national idea,” Putin said in his speech before the students of the Moscow State University in 2016.The Russian Orthodox Church joined the Putin narrative, announcing that the national idea of Russia is to “be holy.”Serebryakov’s opinion is clearly different.But RIA’s characterization of Serebryakov’s statements as “anti-Russian” are misleading.To disagree with and criticize the current government for historical revisionism and to state it has incited conflicts at home and abroad, correct or not, is clearly an opinion regarding policy and not nationality.Serebryakov said as much in comments to RIA Novosti, stating he is “a patriot of Russia, no less than those who shout about it.”Russia -- A still from the Russian film ""Leviathan"" directed by Andrei Zvyagintsev“Since I am a citizen of Russia, I have a civil position which is connected with the fact that war is a terrible tragedy comparable with planetary cataclysms,” he said, adding that life is priceless and he is an “active pacifist against war.”Even his previous comments can be interpreted as much as his Hobbesian view on life in the Russian provinces (a prominent feature of one critically-acclaimed film in which he starred, Leviathan) as anti-Russian sentiment. Serebryakov, who immigrated to Canada with his family in 2012, faced a harsh backlash at that time, with Leviathan producer Alexander Rodnyansky claiming the public outrage only served to prove the actor’s point.""Unfortunately, here in Russia we are familiar with such attacks,” Rodnyansky told The Hollywood Reporter.""Serebryakov's opinion can be irritating to someone and people have the right to disagree with him, but the harassment that ensued, calls to strip him of his Russian passport and ban him from ever working again — this just proves his point, that the Russian society is ill,"" he said.Writing for Vedomosti, Pavel Artekar said “maybe the actor’s words were a little clumsy,” noting that ‘”power, arrogance and rudeness’ cannot be said to define the national identity.”“The description better fits the behavior of Russia’s bureaucrats — at home and abroad — in recent years,” Artekar said.Leviathan itself was similarly lambasted at home for being anti-Russian, with Orthodox Christian activist Kirill Frolov calling it “a filthy libel against the Russian church and the Russian state” and Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky attacking it for alleged inauthenticity. Russia -- A scene from the Russian film ""Leviathan"" directed by Andrei Zvyagintsev“However much the authors made them swear and swig liters of vodka, that doesn’t make them real Russians. I did not recognize myself, my colleagues, acquaintances or even acquaintances of acquaintances in ’Leviathan’s’ characters,” the New York Times cites Medinsky as telling the newspaper Izvestia. “Strange, but among the movie’s characters there is not a single positive one.”Other popular artists in Russia have similarly faced accusations of anti-Russian sentiment when criticizing government policy.Rock star Andrei Makarevich was attacked for his decision to perform in Eastern Ukraine territory under Ukrainian government control, with Yevgeny Fedorov, an MP for the ruling United Russia party, saying he should be stripped of his state awards.In 2014, following Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine, Makarevich found himself alongside fellow rock star Yuri Shevchuk and three political figures – Ilya Ponomarev, Aleksei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov – on a banner hung from House of books reading “Fifth column. Foreigners among us.” A banner unfurled from House of Books in Moscow in 2014 portraying Andrei Makarevich, Yuri Shevchuk, Ilya Ponomarev, Aleksei Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov as fifth columnists. From http://cdn.static1.rtr-vesti.ru/p/o_928559.jpgOf those five men, Navalny has been regularly attacked and blinded in an acid attack, Ponomarev was forced into exile and Nemtsov was murdered outside the Kremlin four years ago on February 27, 2015. All four have been detained and arrested on multiple occasions for organizing or taking part in opposition marches.Russian actress Liya Akhedzhakova, a critic of the Kremlin’s policy, last month said that young people are now afraid to express their civic position.”She added. ""Today there is a lot of Sovietism. There’s snitching. There’s denunciations … it’s generally a tradition in Russia. To knock, to pawn people.”She brought up the case of Alexander Sokurov, a renowned director who correctly predicted his Example of Intonation foundation would be targeted due to his criticism of Putin and the Russian government.Meanwhile, while Russian singer Yuri Loza said Serebryakov should no longer be offered roles and producer Joseph Prigozhin said some people’s minds “are simply missing” in relation to the controversy, actor Alexei Panin said Serebryakov is understood by every reasonable person and “everything he said was correct.”As to Serebryakov’s claims about Russian involvement in Africa, there is plenty of evidence Russia focuses on propping up fragile nations battling civil war, such as the Central Africa Republic.“The current Kremlin is trying to export counterrevolution,” Kiril Avramov told the Voice of America Russian Service. The post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin’s Intelligence Studies Project said than destabilizing regimes, Russia looks for countries already besieged.Last year, Russia proposed a logistic base in Eritrea, an East African country emerging from decades of conflict with a neighbor.";https://belsat.eu/en/news/wagner-group-spotted-russia-using-mercenaries-to-gain-access-to-african-resources-us-dod/,https://www.rbc.ru/politics/03/02/2016/56b1f8a79a7947060162a5a7,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leviathan-star-alexei-serebryakov-stirs-controversy-says-russians-are-rude-arrogant-1087782,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/europe/leviathan-arussian-movie-gets-applause-in-hollywood-but-scorn-at-home.html,https://iz.ru/news/575313#ixzz3AjCVnyYz,https://www.rferl.org/a/russians-nemtsov-commemorate-slain-kremlin-critic/29787740.html,https://www.cosmo.ru/stars/news/13-01-2019/liya-ahedzhakova-zayavila-o-stukachah-i-falsifikacii-televideniya/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/police-investigating-film-foundation-putin-critic-alexander-sorkurov-1166931,https://ria.ru/20190224/1551300969.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-in-africa/4653190.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-eritrea-relations-grow-with-planned-logistics-center/4554680.html;State TV Conflates Leviathan Actor’s Anti-war Stance With 'Anti-Russian' Sentiment;;;;;;

He replied, “Хаха офигенно” [Haha freaking cool] --- in Russian.The brief interaction caused a storm of media headlines and trended on social media in Russia for several days, with prominent figures half-jokingly claiming Musk was Russia’s spy who has just burned his cover. “Ours,” they crowed.“Agent Musk burned hard,” the chief editor of Russia Today and Sputnik, Margarita Simonyan wrote in her Telegram channel posting a screenshot of NTV tweet with Musk’s reply.Many compared Musk with the fictional Soviet spy in the fascist Germany, a KGB agent posing as SS officer Max Otto von Stierlitz during the final days of the Third Reich.The numerous responses including NTV’s own posts threw in the Russian possessive pronoun “Наш” [Ours], giving a base for this fact check even if the claims seemed to be mere jokes.*Note: In Russian, pronouns have forms, in gender the letter “a” added to the end i.e. “nasha” (in Cyrillic Haшa) signifies “female” while “nash” (Haш in Cyrillic) is a male; and the letter “i” at the end shows it’s plural (Наши -- nashi).“Although the third-person possessive is used in this way in other countries as well, I have noticed over the past quarter century that it is used much more often in Russia than elsewhere,” Mark Kramer a Harvard University professor told Polygraph.info.“Journalists and scholars in Russia routinely use ‘nashi’ when referring to ‘rossiiskie’ (Russians) and sometimes they'll use just ‘nashi,’ as in ‘amerikanskie voiska’ (American troops) versus ‘nashi’ or ‘inostrannye studenty’ (foreign students) versus ‘nashi.’ Because of this cultural trait, the use of ‘nashi’ in propaganda slogans seems perfectly normal,” Kramer noted.Russia --pro-government organization ""Nashi"" hounds Jehovah witnesses -- 27Jan2019“In essence, we can think of ‘nashi’ (ours) vs. ‘chujie’ (aliens), as a simplified method for mass consumption of creating a mental map of kinship, ownership and cohesion too,” Dr. Kiril Avramov, fellow at the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas, told Polygraph.info.Claiming ‘ownership’ over foreign celebrities – such as in the case of Musk, or foreign land – КрымНаш (Crimea is ours, most popular in 2014), ДонбассНаш (Donbass is ours), СирияНаша (Syria is ours) foreign politicians – i.e. ТрампНаш (Trump is ours, most popular in 2016) – is nothing new in Russia. On the contrary – over the two decades of President Vladimir Putin’s reign the word [наш] in its various forms has become paramount in the Kremlin’s domestic propaganda and a key social magnifier.Today using [наш] is a declaration of one belonging in a “right” side of the Russian society – being patriotic and proud of his country and supportive of his government, which also means being pro-Putin. The term “nicely fits with the craft of ‘weaponized narratives,’ where ‘nashi’ are the forces of benevolence, while ‘chujie’ are the forces of ultimate corruption, chaos and evil. In sum, the word is not ‘innocent,’ as it was and is skillfully used in multiple contexts against multiple targets,” Avramov said.It is akin, in a way, to the loyalty often engendered in sports fans who love all associated with their team, and see anybody associated with the other side to be enemies.As shown on the graphs, from March 2016 to January 2019, posts containing Nash and Nasha have been on the decline in the last two years, but engagement actions, reactions have started to increase in January 2019.Posts containing Nash and Nasha have been on the decline since 2016 but engagement actions, reactions have started to increase in January 2019.The timeline of engagements and interactions with use of Nash/NashaIn Russia such possessive pronouns are “the tools for manipulation of the public opinion, as well a key characteristic of a politician, reflecting his worldview and ideology,” Dr. of Philology Maria Laskova, at the Russian Southern Federal University, wrote in the study, “Personal pronouns in the political discourse.”“The weaponization of the term is very effective, as once it has become a popular slogan, battle cry and a cognitive signifier, it quickly became popular not only at elite level discourse (i.e. speeches, official documents), but also at mass level,” said Avramov.  The term “is inclusive enough to embrace anywhere from mass activists to Elon Musk and has proven to be a very potent tool for quick marking and targeting of everything and everyone not deemed ‘ours’ that is equated with ‘pure,’ thus casting them as ‘foreign’ thus ‘impure,” Avramov said. “Logically, the people and groups belonging to the second category do not qualify to be equal, respectful and welcome in the new Kremlin worldview.”The graph shows the use of Nash/Nasha by country​Note: Elon Musk holds citizenship to three countries, none of them Russia.

And we will get to those in the narrative lower in this article. We thought it would be helpful to break down the claims and counterclaims involving the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty before directly addressing the details that lead to the Polygraph.info verdict:What the US ClaimsU.S. Government: The U.S. has said since 2014 that Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty, though very few of the details have been made publicly available. In 2017, the State Department did reveal the missile in question -- the 9M729. In 2018, the U.S. ambassador to Russia said the U.S. had provided “geographic coordinates” and the dates of tests showing the violations.​Infographic showing missiles banned under the INF Treaty.​Russian Response:  The Russian government consistently denies violations.Third Party: The director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, an independent academic research project, insists the U.S. could have only “indirect” evidence -- that the rocket had not been tested to distances that would verify a violation. The indirect evidence could include “detailed blueprints of the missile and all its technical characteristics.” The Dutch government says it has verified, based on its own independent intelligence, that Russia is developing a cruise missile in violation of the treaty. What Russia ClaimsThe Russian Government: The government says the U.S. the Aegis Ashore missile defense system and a vertical launcher deployed in Romania could be used for offensive missiles.The U.S. Government: The Aegis was developed as a purely defensive system to protect U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. claims the newer, land-based Aegis also is defensive.Third Party: The Arms Control Association’s executive director says the Aegis system can be equipped with offensive weapons, though he adds these ""are not equivalent problems.""The VerdictWe find President Putin’s words to be misleading. The 9M729 missile that is already deployed in European Russia is a threat to a number of European countries, whatever claims to its are accurate -- the Russian or the U.S. The Details – a NarrativeDuring a February 2 televised working meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, that day’s decision by the Trump administration to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on February 2 was the chief topic.Lavrov said Moscow had done “everything” to save the INF Treaty, given its “importance in terms of sustaining strategic stability in Europe, as well as globally.” Shoigu said the country would develop new types of weapons, including a ground-based long-range hypersonic missile system.Despite placing all of the blame on the U.S., Putin said Moscow would not place short- or medium-ranged weapons “in Europe or in other regions of the world” if analogous U.S. weapons were not deployed in corresponding regions.""For many years, we have repeatedly raised the issue of substantive negotiations on disarmament issues, in almost all its aspects. And in recent years, we see that our partners do not support our initiatives. On the contrary, all the time pretexts are sought out for dismantling the already established system of international security,” Putin said.Arms Control Association: 'The Start of a Conversation'Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told Polygraph.info that President Putin’s proposal is “the start of a conversation,” but ultimately Moscow would be required to remove “those missiles that it has already deployed to locations further in the east so they cannot hit targets in Europe.”Washington, DC -- Daryl G. Kimball (left), Executive Director at the Arms Control Association, takes questions from the audience, in United States Institute of Peace on Monday, Sept. 15, 2014.He added: “That would calm the waters in the absence of the INF Treaty. It’s not an ideal solution but it’s one way to avoid each side from rushing to develop and deploy prohibited missiles.”Kimball’s assertion that Russia will “ultimately” need to move the missiles reflects the State Department’s 2014 assessment that Russia was in violation, despite a later congressional assessment the U.S. “did not offer any details.”RUSSIA -- Lt. Gen. Mikhail Matveevsky, the chief of the military's missile and artillery forces, left, speaks during a briefing by the Russian Defense Ministry, as the 9M729 land-based cruise missile, center, is displayed near its launcher.The State Department ReportThe U.S. Department of State Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Bureau, in an unclassified April 2018 report, “determined” that Russia “continued to be in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 kilometers to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.”It identified the Russian missile as the SSC-8 (Novator 9M729), and added details that covert development began in the mid-2000s, testing soon afterward. An independent report indicated the Novator had not been tested beyond INF limits even as late as 2015.RUSSIA -- Russian Defense Ministry officials show off the Russia's 9M729 cruise missile at the military Patriot Park outside Moscow, January 23, 2019The State Department report concluded:The GLCM has a range capability between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, a treaty violation; It is distinct from an earlier version; and,The missile is distinct, with the Russian designation as the 9M729.A January 2019 Congressional Research Service report noted that Russian diplomats had proposed that Russia display the 9M729 “and demonstrate that it could not fly to INF range…” The U.S. rejected this proposal, arguing inspection was not enough to verify and demanding Russia destroy the missile.” After U.S. National Security Council official Christopher Ford revealed the the 9M729 in a November 29, 2017 speech, Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, an independent scientific analysis organization, said the designation, alone, did not mean much.In December 5, 2017 blog post, Podvig said he had earlier suspected the missile in question had “not been tested to the INF range from a mobile ground-based launcher,” adding he was certain that suspicion was correct.“This means that the evidence of a violation is indirect,” he said.Podvig noted that under the INF Treaty, actual testing is not required if it can be proven a missile’s capabilities exceed the range. He posited that either U.S. intelligence “has detailed blueprints” or, more likely, the missile is “almost identical” to another that was tested, the sea-launched Kalibr.”By February 4, 2019, the U.S. claimed it knew Russia had flight tested the 9M729 to distances well over 500 kilometers.US: 'Geographic Coordinates' and Test Dates“The United States has provided Moscow with substantial information about this system’s violations, including geographic coordinates and dates for the tests, but Russia continues to deny any wrongdoing,” U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Huntsman wrote.Likewise, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok and Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld wrote a letter last November stating that “based on intelligence …The Netherlands can independently confirm that Russia has developed and is currently introducing a ground-based cruise weapon.”But neither country provided specific details. NATO foreign ministers released a statement supporting the U.S. position regarding the alleged Russian violation, following a meeting December 4.Asked why the U.S. had not disclosed related information to publically bolster its case, Kimball said U.S. intelligence likely “did not want to compromise its sources or methods.”“Methods by which the U.S. has gathered the information are very sensitive and parts of the U.S. government, the intelligence community in particular, are reluctant to provide that information,” he told Polygraph.info.But Kimball added that if Russia is in the wrong, “we need to show that Russia is in the wrong” by providing “information that third parties can see that undergirds the U.S. case.”Russian Claims on the Missle Are InconsistentMeanwhile, the CRS report quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergey Ryabkov calling the U.S. claims “fabrications” that are “inconsistent with reality.”RUSSIA -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov speaks during a news conference in Moscow, February 7, 2019Ryabkov claimed the 9M729 is an “upgraded” version of the Iskander-M system missile whose maximum range was demonstrated at the Kapustin Yar testing ground in Astrakhan, southern Russia, as less than 480 kilometers, not an INF violation.As Polygraph.info has reported recently, the Russian Defense Ministry displayed the 9M729 missile at an expo center in Moscow in January, and said more than 100 missile launches were conducted over the six years from 2008 to 2014 at the Kapustin Yar missile range in southern Russia.But Zvezda, the Defense Ministry’s official TV channel, quoted the commander of the Russian military’s missile and artillery forces, as indicating that some of these launches in fact exceeded the INF Treaty’s 500-kilometer range limit.US Aegis Ashore“Rather than addressing U.S. concerns, Russia chose to claim that U.S. ballistic missile defense targets, Aegis Ashore missile defense systems in Poland and Romania, and armed UAVs violate the treaty,” the U.S. ambassador, Huntsman wrote. “In contrast, the United States has responded in detail to these false Russian claims, demonstrating that we diligently comply with our treaty obligations in full.”RUSSIA -- U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin wall in Moscow, October 23, 2018But Kimball said that while some of Russia’s claims are “an attempt to create a counter-narrative,” others “should be responded to in a much more serious way.”He noted that Russia has a legitimate concern that the Aegis Ashore missile-defense systems and the Mk-41 Vertical Launching systems deployed in Romania can be used for offensive missiles.“Russia modifying the 9M729 or getting rid of it [in exchange for] the U.S. agreeing to measures that we won’t use Aegis Ashore and that we won’t launch missiles into their territory [are options on the table],” Kimball told Polygraph.info. “These are not equivalent problems – they are not both violations – but there is obvious trade space,” he added, should the two countries chose to continue negotiating.But he added neither the Trump administration nor Moscow are as “interested in solving this problem as they should be.”A recent report by the Wall Street Journal that Russia has already deployed four battalions of the 9M729 further chips away at Putin’s claim of compliance.With Russia’s recent admission of test violations, and reports the missile is deployed, Putin’s claim that Russia will not place short- and medium-range weapons in Europe is moot and Polygraph.info finds Putin’s statement is misleading at best.";https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/230108.pdf,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43832,https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/280774.pdf,https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/ssc-8-novator-9m729/,https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/280774.pdf,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43832,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900053894/jon-huntsman-jr-this-is-russias-last-chance-to-save-our-nuclear-treaty-inf-reagan.html,http://NOSC:/Users/ftlisova/Downloads/se_conclusie_over_de_Russische_schending_van_het_INF-verdrag_(Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces).pdf,https://nos.nl/artikel/2261130-nederland-heeft-bewijs-voor-verboden-kruisraket-in-rusland.html,https://nltimes.nl/2018/11/28/netherlands-proof-russia-developed-prohibited-cruise-missile,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43832,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-missile-inf-violation-fact-check/29729261.html,https://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/2019123126-DiO1a.html,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900053894/jon-huntsman-jr-this-is-russias-last-chance-to-save-our-nuclear-treaty-inf-reagan.html,https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-brink-of-arms-treaty-exit-u-s-finds-more-offending-russian-missiles-11548980645;Putin Makes Suspect Claim on Missile Deployment;;;;;;

It does, through diplomatic channels, encourage other countries to adopt certain policies,” former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told Polygraph.info.Steven Pifer, former U.S. Ambassador and Brookings Institute Expert in Prague, CZPifer believes it is “entirely plausible” that in recent months the United States has urged the Hungarian government to take steps to protect itself against Chinese cyber espionage and to support Ukraine against Russian aggression.“Hungary has been weak on those issues,” Pifer said.“But a senior Hungarian official said Mr. Orban strongly objects to U.S. pressure aimed at curbing the influence of Moscow and Beijing in Europe,” the WSJ reported, still falling well short of Ria Novosti’s assertion that the U.S. 'ordered' the Hungarian government to take action.HUNGARY -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban waves during his speech outside the Hungarian Parliament building in Budapest, Hungary, Thursday, March 15, 2018 during celebrations of the Hungarian national holiday.As for the RIA Novosti’s mistranslation of the WSJ article, Pifer calls it “deliberate” and intended “to support a Kremlin propaganda line” that the United States controls its NATO allies and other European partners.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has told U.S. diplomats that he wants his country to be “neutral, like Austria,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

Zakharova also claimed that despite the Netherlands’ non-cooperative attitude, Russia has fully satisfied every request from the Joint Investigative Team (JIT).Of the two claims -- that Russia is fully satisfying JIT requests and the Netherlands is not sharing all details with Russia – only the latter is true, while the first remains debatable and likely false.EmbedshareRussian Maker of Missile that Shot Down MH-17 Reports Increased Global Sales, Even Under SanctionsEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:160:00Jeichien de Graaff, a press officer for the Dutch National Public Prosecutor's Office in Rotterdam, told Polygraph.info: “The Russian authorities have not executed all the JIT requests so far. Since quite some time several simple questions have remained unanswered.” The press office did not provide further details regarding the nature of those questions.De Graaff also confirmed that Zakharova was correct in saying that the Russian side has not been granted full access to material from the investigation.As Russia has stressed it is willing “to fully cooperate” with the investigation, “the JIT is gladly expecting the answers,” De Graaff said, adding: “That does not mean that (Russia) will have access to the complete investigation: it is not customary to give insight in an ongoing criminal investigation.”Investigators have settled on Russia as the culprit in the downing of the civilian aircraft.​In May 2018, the JIT released a report concluding that the Russian military was responsible for shooting down MH-17 and killing its passengers and crew. Shortly after the report’s release, the Netherlands and Australian authorities announced they were initiating a formal procedure to bring Russia before an international tribunal and hold it responsible for this crime, which they said was proven beyond reasonable doubt.Russia has obstinately denied any involvement in the crime, producing about 60 different versions of the MH-17 downing, many of which Polygraph.info and other fact-checkers have examined and debunked.;http://russian.rt.com/ussr/news/595554-niderlandy-rossiya-mh17-zaharova,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/12/6/6d/6d90f79f-bbe1-43e0-819f-1090f5fb71d1_mobile.mp4,/a/russia-mh-17-jit-fact-check/6740932.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740932.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740932.html&text=Russian+Maker+of+Missile+that+Shot+Down+MH-17+Reports+Increased+Global+Sales%2c+Even+Under+Sanctions,/a/6740932.html,/embed/player/Article/6740932.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,http://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-crash/@103196/update-criminal-0/,/a/29251216.html;Russia Complains MH-17 Investigation Keeps Secrets from Moscow.

Russia said the range of the 9M729 does not exceed the 500-kilometer range allowed by the INF Treaty, which was signed between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union 1987 and meant to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that more than 100 missile launches were conducted over the six years from 2008 to 2014 at the Kapustin Yar missile range in southern Russia.Zvezda, the Defense Ministry’s official TV channel, quoted Lieutenant-General Mikhail Matveyevsky, commander of the Russian military’s missile and artillery forces, indicating that some of these launches in fact exceeded the INF Treaty’s 500-kilometer range limit. Matveyevsky said Russia had notified the U.S. of those launches.Moscow had previously categorically denied U.S. accusations that it had violated the INF Treaty, insisting that Washington had “failed to provide proof.” On January 17, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov repeated the claim, saying that the 9M729 system “has never been tested for a range banned” by the treaty.However, Ryabkov’s claim is contradicted by Matveyevsky’s statement.Russia has until February 2 to comply with U.S. demands and destroy the 9M729 missile system if Moscow wants to save the INF Treaty. That deadline was announced by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said in Brussels on December 4 that Washington would start a six-month process to formally withdraw from the INF Treaty if Russia did not return to compliance with the treaty terms within 60 days. “We must control Russian cheating on its arms control obligations,” Pompeo said, calling Russia’s approach a “flagrant disregard for the express terms of the INF Treaty.”Also on December 4, NATO foreign ministers said in a statement that the U.S. “has remained in full compliance” with the INF Treaty. They said that Russia responded to concerns about the 9M729 missile system over the past five years “with denials and obfuscation.”On January 15, U.S. and Russian officials met in Geneva to try and reach an agreement, but both sides said the attempt was a failure. Russia offered to allow the U.S. to inspect Moscow’s new missile but Washington rejected the proposal, stating that such an inspection would not reveal the true potential of the 9M729 and demanding instead that Russia destroy it.U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson said the inspection of the missile would not allow the U.S. to “confirm the distance that missile can travel.”In November 2018, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats briefed the U.S. Congress on Russia’s INF violations, stating the U.S. assessed that Russia had “flight-tested, produced and deployed” cruise missiles with a range capability prohibited by the INF Treaty. Coats said Russia began the “covert development” of the 9M729 missile in the mid-2000’s, completing a “comprehensive flight test program” by 2015.Coats alleged that Russia conducted the program in a way “purposefully designed to disguise the true nature of their testing activity as well as the capability of the 9M729 missile.”According to a U.S. Congressional report submitted on January 18, the range of the Russian 9M729 missile is “well over” the 500 kilometers permitted by the INF Treaty.Coats explained that if Russia deployed the 9M729 missile only from a fixed launcher, as a sea-based or air-delivered cruise missile, that would be compatible with the INF Treaty even with ranges exceeding 500 kilometers. Instead, Russia tested the same missile from a mobile launcher.Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats Testifies Before the Congress“By putting the two types of tests together,” Coats said, Russia developed an INF-range missile that could be launched from a “mobile-ground” platform.The resulting 9M729 missile system is in violation of the terms of the INF Treaty, under which the sides agreed “not to possess, produce, flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 kilometers to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.”The latest developments followed an announcement by President Donald Trump in October that the U.S. would leave the 1987 treaty. The announcement took U.S. allies in Europe by surprise.

Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said the PACE invitation outlined the criteria for selecting the Russian delegation.RUSSIA -- Deputy Speaker Pyotr Tolstoy attends a meeting in the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017“These criteria are related both to the fractional principle, well-known to you, and to the perhaps less known principle of gender equality,” Tolstoy said. “I think six sexes are indicated.”The PACE Charter, he added, declares that all Council of Europe members have equal rights.""It is from this equality that we, the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, and our colleagues from the Federation Council [the upper chamber of Russia’s parliament] proceed,"" Tolstoy said. ""We believe that the current situation is unacceptable.""According to Mediametrics.ru, the “PACE six genders requirement” was #3 top headline in the Russian media on Wednesday, January 9, and the most discussed topic on social media.In a live interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma’s Foreign Relations Committee, called the PACE letter “a provocation, specifically to coerce the Russian delegation to slam the door and pull out of PACE.”Both Tolstoy and Slutsky’s claims are false.PACE gave Polygraph.info a copy of the letter sent to the Russian parliament, which stated that Russia’s PACE delegation include “at a very minimum one member of the under-represented sex appointed as a representative.”“This is a standard letter, (exactly the same as every year) which all speakers of our national parliaments received at the end of November 2018,” wrote Micaela Catalano, head of the Communication Division Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, in an email to Polygraph.info.In June 2018, PACE adopted Resolution 2222 “Promoting Diversity and Equality in Politics.”The resolution states: “Diversity is an inherent part of European societies and contributes to their richness. However, all too often, elected institutions fail to mirror this diversity, reinforcing the stereotype that politics is the reserve of a certain category of people, to the exclusion of others. Women, visible minorities, people with an immigration background, national minorities, young people, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people and persons with disabilities remain under-represented in politics at local, regional, national and European level. This representation gap perpetuates the idea that politics is reserved for a select group, composed mostly of white, heterosexual men over 50.” At their most diverse, Russian PACE delegations in past years have included only two women and never members of sexual minorities, those whose sexual orientation, identity or characteristics differ from the majority, who in Russia are constantly subjected to harassment and homophobia.While charges of sexual assault and harassment have brought down the careers of politicians and celebrities in West, and some have even been criminally prosecuted, Slutsky has not suffered such consequences despite multiple sexual harassment accusations made against him. Indeed, Slutsky, along with various higher-ups and colleagues, have simply waved off such accusations. MOSCOW, RUSSIA - State Duma member Leonid Slutsky at a plenary meeting of the Russian State Duma, December 6, 2017.In 2014, PACE suspended the Russian delegation’s voting rights over the annexation of Crimea and military interference in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s PACE delegation continues to demand the immediate restoration of full representation while fully supporting the Kremlin’s foreign policy acts. On Thursday, January 10, after PACE made public a copy of the letter sent to the Russian parliament, Tolstoy admitted he had made a “grave mistake” about the number of genders.Russia -- Sergei Markov (L), Russian Public Chamber member, vice-rector of Plekhanov Economic University, and Pyotr Tolstoy, State Duma Deputy Chairman, take part in the Action Forum organised by the All-Russian People's Front on November 22, 2016​“I repent,” he wrote on Facebook. “There are, of course, not six, but only two - male and female. All the other individuals are ‘underrepresented sexes’, genders; that is precisely what is being referred to in the PACE letter … Where we get them remains to be determined.”";http://website-pace.net/en_GB/web/apce/plenary-session,https://riafan.ru/1139293-gosdume-predlozhili-napravit-delegaciyu-v-pase-iz-predstavitelei-shesti-polov?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop,https://mediametrics.ru/rating/ru/hour.html,http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=24812&lang=en,https://tass.ru/politika/3821917,https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-sexual-minorities-21876,https://humanrightshouse.org/articles/discrimination-of-sexual-minorities-2/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-metoo-journalists-harrassed/29096430.html,http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=4982,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=695419607518633&set=a.161061597621106&type=3&theat;Is Europe’s Gender Equality Resolution a ‘Provocation’ Against Russia?;;;;;;

President Vladimir Putin appointed him to head Roscosmos in May 2018.While Roscosmos said it is “waiting for official explanations” from NASA, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted a source in Roscosmos as saying that, in retaliation for NASA rescinding the invitation to Rogozin, Moscow was considering canceling “already reached agreements” with NASA, including the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G), a joint project to build a permanent space station orbiting the Moon.However, it should be noted that Rogozin spoke out against the LOP-G project as Roscosmos chief even before NASA disinvited him. Last September 22, he announced that Russia would not be part of the project under the conditions laid out by the U.S. side, because “the Russian Federation cannot afford to participate in supporting roles.""In November, Rogozin half-jokingly said, Russia's own Lunar mission will be tasked with verifying whether the U.S. ever landed on the Moon feeding a conspiracy theory, which is very popular in Russia.Commenting on the potential unraveling of the U.S.-Russian space partnership, Vinogradov said the “political insanity in America is beginning to go off scale and has risen to cosmic heights,” but claimed Russia and Rogozin will “live quite tranquilly without NASA,” while NASA and the U.S. companies will face hardships.Vinogradov’s assessment is inaccurate: though it can be argued that the U.S. companies and NASA will have to adjust their plans if the bilateral space partnership collapses, Russia have to deal with losing billions in U.S. funds and thus be the biggest loser.There are multiple contracts between the U.S. and Russian space agencies under which Russia provides the services while the U.S. provides the funds. For example, under the contract between NASA and Roscosmos for the delivery of U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), Russia has received $935 million over just the last three years. Notably, Russia has raised the price for transporting each American astronaut ten-fold over the last 10 years: in 2008, the U.S. paid Russia $21.8 million for each astronaut, while in 2018, the price for the same service was $82 million.U.S. -- The Dragon crew capsule sits in the SpaceX hangar at Launch Complex 39-A, where the space ship and Falcon 9 booster rocket are being prepared for a January 2019 launch at Cape Canaveral, Florida, December 18, 2018NASA would pay much less for such services if they were provided by private companies rather than Roscosmos: both Boeing and Elon Mask’s SpaceX have proposed to send NASA’s astronauts to the ISS for $58 million each. There is also the issue of quality of service: while Roscosmos managed 19 successful launches in 2018, the two U.S. companies had 29 successful launches in the same period.Washington has invested over $100 billion in operating the ISS, and the U.S. Congress is planning to extend the existing authorization for operating the ISS beyond 2024. At the same time, the U.S. is preparing to transition from NASA sponsorship of space travel to “a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise.” As stated in the NASA Authorization Act of 2017.A NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit supports the notion that the Russian space agency faces more significant funding issues than the U.S. companies. The OIG noted that if NASA met its initial goal of using private companies to transport astronauts, “NASA could have avoided paying Russia close to $1 billion for Soyuz seats in 2017 and 2018…”Along with the potential loss of the U.S. funding, Roscosmos is already facing major problems. In 2015, the Russian government significantly reduced Roscosmos’s budget, limiting its 10-year funding to $22.5 billion – roughly $2.2 billion a year -- compared to NASA’s annual funding of $18 billion.But even Roscosmos’s scarce funding is not guaranteed. The Russian state agency Sputnik reported in May 2018 that the Russian space agency could receive 17 billion rubles (around $240 million) less in 2019 than initially planned, while it may see a reduction of funding by 52 billion rubles (around $747 million ) in 2020 and 75 billion rubles (around $1.08 billion) less in 2021.In addition to financial hardships, Roscosmos has been under scrutiny due to multiple corruption scandals and failed space missions in 2018.Last August, a hole in the ISS caused leakage from the space station, and claims that it was deliberately drilled from inside triggered a storm of conspiracy theories.​In October, a failed Roscosmos rocket launched with two astronauts on board, a Russian and an American Nick Hague resulted in an emergency landing. Both survived, describing the experience as “harrowing.”In November, the head of Russia’s Audit Chamber, Alexei Kudrin, accused Roscosmos of embezzling of billions of rubles in public funds.";http://www.nasa.gov/content/russian-cosmonaut-pavel-vinogradov,http://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/05/nasa-administrator-rescinds-invitation-russian-counterpart-after-backlash-capitol-hill/?utm_term=.123bfe52a22d,http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/17/fact-sheet-ukraine-related-sanctions,http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/57543,http://www.roscosmos.ru/25911/,http://ria.ru/20190106/1549065457.html,http://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-roscosmos-sign-joint-statement-on-researching-exploring-deep-space,http://https://ria.ru/20180922/1529135782.html,http://www.apnews.com/1966a07c5a63419fb825ed7a92cec8de,http://nsn.fm/hots/vinogradov-politicheskiy-marazm-v-ssha-podnyalsya-do-kosmicheskikh-vysot.html,http://www.currenttime.tv/a/29538739.html,http://spacenews.com/house-joins-senate-in-push-to-extend-iss/,http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/iss_transition_update.pdf,https://www.businessinsider.com/astronaut-cost-per-soyuz-seat-2016-9,http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-space-agency-gets-major-budget-cut-for-the-next-decade-2015-12,http://sputniknews.com/science/201805301064927907-roscosmos-funds-change-state-program/,http://www.inquisitr.com/5232932/that-hole-in-the-international-space-station-was-the-result-of-a-botched-repair-job-not-sabotage/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+google%2FyDYq+%28The+Inquisitr+-+News%29&utm_content=Yahoo+Search+Results,http://www.space.com/42155-soyuz-abort-astronaut-nick-hague-first-interviews.html,http://www.aerotime.aero/clement.charpentreau/22122-roskosmos-accused-of-embezzling-billions-in-public-funds;Are the U.S. and NASA the Biggest Losers if ‘Cosmic Relations' with Russia Unravel?;;;;;;

The verdict is unchanged. This story was originally published January 5, 2019].Following the December 28, 2018 arrest in Moscow of Paul Whelan, an American citizen charged with espionage, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted:“I often get asked if it’s safe to travel to Russia as a tourist or student. I always used to say yes, and with enthusiasm. After Whelan arrest, however, I will change my advice.”This tweet elicited a strong reaction from Danielle Ryan, a Dublin-based freelance journalist.Writing for RT, the Russian state media outlet, Ryan attacked McFaul for changing his position on the safety of traveling to Russia in the wake of the Whelan arrest: “Miraculously, the arrest of one American seems to have changed everything. It is unlikely, however, that McFaul issued similar advice to his Russian friends after the arrest of Russian citizen Maria Butina, who last year was accused of acting as a foreign agent in the United States without proper registration.”A combo photo shows Paul Whelan and Maria Butina.Ryan writes that the assumption would never be made that the U.S. is unsafe for Russian tourists based on Butina’s arrest, adding that is not because the U.S. is a “crime-free paradise where justice reigns supreme.”“No, it’s because of endless and tiresome double standards imposed on Russia by both US officials and the media,” she wrote. “It’s always one assumption for the US and another for Russia; Whelan is an American arrested in Moscow, so he must be innocent (and Russia must be dangerous), but Butina was a Russian arrested in Washington DC, so she must be guilty (and the US is simply seeking justice). Facts and evidence become irrelevant in the rush to compound the ‘correct’ narrative.”Butina, in fact, pleaded guilty on December 13, 2018 to conspiracy and acting under the direction of the Russian government.In her plea deal, Butina admitted to conspiring with a Russian official and two Americans to infiltrate the National Rifle Association to create unofficial lines of communication between Russian officials and U.S. conservatives, with the goal of advancing Russia’s interests. As part of her plea deal, one count of acting as a covert foreign agent was dropped. She faces a maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation upon completing her sentence.The case surrounding Whelan, a Canadian-born former U.S. Marine and security executive who has British and Irish citizenship, is unclear.Screen grab of Paul Whelan's Vkontakte socail media account from January 2019.A security source told the Russian news agency Rosbalt that Whelan was caught “red-handed” in his Metropol hotel room receiving a flash drive with a list of employees of a Russian security agency.Rosbalt is run by Natalia Cherkesova, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, a Putin associate, former first deputy director of the Federal Security Service and former head of Russia’s Federal Drug Control Service.Regarding the thumb drive, Journalist Julia Ioffe tweeted that Russian police and secret services are notorious for planting evidence on suspects. She added: “Doesn't mean that Whelan is not a spy, but just something to keep in mind.”John Sipher, who ran the CIA’s operations in Russia, told the Washington Post the agency would “almost never send someone to Russia without diplomatic immunity.”“Given the laxity of Russian laws and the aggressiveness of their espionage apparatus, we could not guarantee the safety of someone traveling under unofficial cover,” Sipher said.Journalist Julia Davis said that Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, who has represented “numerous” senior Russian government officials, has already floated the idea of an exchange for Butina. “This is a long process,” Davis quoted Zherebenkov as saying. “I myself hope that we can rescue and bring home one Russian soul.” -- to which McFaul commented: “Sounds like Zherebenkov is representing Butina, not Whelan.”If convicted, Whelan faces 20 years in prison, which would make him the first U.S. citizen sentenced in Russia on espionage charges since the conviction of Edmond Pope in 2000.In response to Ryan, McFaul wrote that “a regime that arbitrarily arrests foreigners is a dangerous one.” But regarding Whelan’s guilt or innocence, he added: “If Im wrong about Whelan, Ill delete tweet.” (sic)McFaul later tweeted that the State Department had issued a travel advisory saying “exactly the same thing” as he had written: “[E]xercise increased caution due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”The State Department further said that “U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.”It further notes that “terrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region, including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom.”Daghestan -- Members of Russian special forces stand guard during an operation on suspected militants in Makhachkala, January 20, 2014.Ryan also wrote that “Russia is as safe for American tourists (or any other tourists, for that matter) as any other European country is,” adding that “the fact that a former official who really should know better is perpetuating the myth of deep, dark, dangerous Russia is utterly ridiculous.”We judge Ryan’s op-ed to be misleading at best, and major elements of her argument to be simply untrue.It is true that the U.S. State Department lists Russia at a “Level 2” travel advisory -- the same as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia, Spain, Britain, Italy, Ukraine and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The State Department updated its judgment on Russia in mid-December, before the Whelan arrest.Consider, also, information gleaned from the United Nations.Citing the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Alexandra Lysova of Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Candadaand Nikolay Shchitov of the Far Eastern Federal University, Russia, noted that as of 2014, Russia’s homicide rate was “the highest in Europe and one of the highest in the world.”Russia -- A woman lays flowers at the place where Boris Nemtsov was killed before a memorial march for Nemtsov to mark the second anniversary of his murder, in Moscow, February 26, 2017That figure has dropped significantly, from a peak of 33 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 10.82 per 100,000 or 15,561 “intentional homicides” in 2016, according to the UNODC.Lysova told Polygraph.info that while “improved quality of life and political stability in Russia in the 2000s” could potentially explain the declining murder rate, a so-called ‘decivilizing process,’ characterized by rampant corruption, predatory policing, political repression, state violence against businesses, rising xenophobia and apathy, could “likewise be expected to be associated with a less precipitous decline in homicide or stable homicide rate in this period.”Lysova, assistant professor in the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University and once a professor in Vladivostok, Russia said she shares the concerns of other Russian criminologists who doubt that murder rates dropped as precipitously as the statistics show.“By considering legal mechanisms alone, the more accurate homicide rate may be at least 1.6 times higher than that reported by the police and reprinted in the UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2013. Sergey Inshakov in his book on a dark figure of crime in Russia (2011) also suggested that there was no a precipitous decline in murder rates and that the real murder rates were much higher than those reported by the police in the 2000s.”Although Ryan “felt safer” walking in Moscow after dark than Washington D.C. or Budapest, nationwide, Russia has a higher per capita homicide rate than Hungary or the United States.For 2016, the UNODC registered 17,250 intentional homicides in the United States or 5.35 per 100,000 people – roughly half the level in Russia.The rate in Hungary was 2.07 per 100,000 or 202 intentional homicides.A screen shot from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime showing intentional homicide stats for Russia, the United States and Hungary.Statistically, however, Moscow is a much safer city than Washington D.C. in terms of intentional homicide.According to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, Moscow city itself registered 2.5 murders per 100,000 people, while Moscow region registered 6.9 murders per 100,000 people.In Washington D.C., there were 116 homicides in 2017 or 17 per 100,000 residents, making it America’s 16th most dangerous city, according to an analysis conducted by USA Today.Homicide statistics for Budapest that year were unavailable.But as Lysova noted, the statistics in Russia’s case do not tell the entire story.And it is not just homicide. Lysova said a quick scan of police statistics for showed that there had only been 3,900 reported rapes for all of 2015.“I think it’s reasonable to expect that the number of rapes, including attempts, should exceed the number of homicides, including attempts,” she said. “Some unofficial estimates of 10,000 people who became victims of rape in Russia in 2015 seem more realistic. Organizations that help female victims of sexual abuse in Russia provide estimates that only 10-12% of rape victims actually report incidents to the police in Russia. Victims are ashamed and afraid they will not be treated by the police fairly and with respect. Moreover, even if victims decide to report the incidents to the police, only one in about five incidents would be accepted and investigated by the police.”It is currently too early to determine if the cases of Whelan and Butina are commensurate. Any conclusions (or comparisons) at this point would be purely speculative.But Polygraph.info finds that Ryan’s claim that Russia is as safe for American tourists as any other European country is misleading.";https://www.rosbalt.ru/moscow/2019/01/03/1756367.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/american-paul-whelan-charged-with-espionage-in-russia-news-agency-reports/2019/01/03/51dab55a-0f6a-11e9-8f0c-6f878a26288a_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.02acf6f85788,http://edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/11/05/pope/index.html,https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/19/homicides-toll-big-u-s-cities-2017/302763002/;Updated: RT Op-Ed Attacks McFaul For Travel Warning after Espionage Arrest;;;;;;

Actually, Russian Authorities Denied Access;2019-01-03;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"The report by Russia Today (RT) came a day after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that Russia has missed the December 31, 2018 deadline for compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code. By that deadline, the Russian authorities were supposed to meet two conditions imposed by WADA’s Executive Committee back in September.Also on January 2, 16 national anti-doping organizations issued a joint statement calling on WADA to suspend Russia immediately, stating: ""Russia has failed to meet its obligations."" RT’s January 2 report used language implying that it was the World Anti-Doping Agency’s own fault for not being able to access Moscow laboratory (LIMS) data, and that WADA president Craig Reedie had seemingly expressed disappointment toward his own organization.SWITZERLAND -- Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA) director general Yury Ganus (L) meets World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Craig Reedie at the opening of the 2018 edition of the WADA Annual Symposium in Lausanne, March 21, 2018Reedie actually said: “I am bitterly disappointed that data extraction from the former Moscow Laboratory has not been completed by the date agreed by WADA’s ExCo in September 2018.” The RT report included the quote, but several paragraphs after the misleading opening sentence of the article. WADA followed with a statement on January 2 leaving no space for doubt about who the organization blamed for the failure: “We are extremely disappointed that the Dec. 31 deadline imposed on Russia by WADA has not been adhered to by the Russian authorities.”RUSSIA -- Russian National Anti-doping Agency RUSADA office in Moscow, September 20, 2018The one condition Russia failed to fulfill was to provide WADA’s five-person team of experts with full access to the raw data of the former Moscow laboratory (LIMS). The facility was sealed after playing a central role in the doping scandal that stunned Russian professional sports starting in 2014 and led to disqualifications of top Russian athletes, the loss of medals for cheating during the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency – RUSADA -- ending up suspended by WADA.Before sending in the team of experts, WADA representatives met on November 28 with top Russian officials regarding access to the Moscow lab. According to WADA, the parties thoroughly discussed “logistics and next steps” and a “full technical mission” was “provisionally planned.” Russia agreed that WADA’s technical mission would arrive in Moscow in mid-December and the Russians would provide full access to the Moscow lab’s authentic data.The WADA mission arrived in Moscow on December 17 but had to leave empty-handed four days later after the Russian Federal Investigative Committee denied the group full access to the data and its extraction and export from Russia.RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) listens to Chairman of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin (R) during a meeting in Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, 28 March 2018The reason given by the Russian law enforcement agency was that “the team’s equipment to be used for the data extraction was required to be certified under Russian law.” The issue, WADA said, “had not been raised during an initial meeting on 28 November in Moscow.”“The raw data is the missing piece of the puzzle that will complement the duplicate LIMS database that is already in WADA’s possession and help conclude WADA’s McLaren and Operation LIMS investigations,” WADA said at the time, referring to the July 2016 report on the Moscow lab’s data by independent Canadian expert Richard McLaren.Switzrerland -- Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren who produced a report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which claimed that Russia had orchestrated state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics addresses the assembly during the WADA AnnualThe preliminary report on WADA’s McLaren and Operation LIMS investigations accused Russia of “state sponsored doping” – an accusation the Russian officials repeatedly denied.The consequences could be grave for the Russian sports, WADA said: “Russia will be declared non-compliant. Only this action will be suitable and appropriate in the view of the athletes. Anything less will be considered a failure by WADA to act on behalf of clean athletes.”";http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-01/wada-update-on-extraction-of-moscow-laboratory-data-and-rusada-compliance-status,http://twitter.com/danroan/status/1080441781706207232/photo/1,http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-01/wada-update-on-extraction-of-moscow-laboratory-data-and-rusada-compliance-status,http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-01/statement-from-the-wada-athlete-committee-on-russian-compliance-situation,https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-01/wada-update-on-extraction-of-moscow-laboratory-data-and-rusada-compliance-status,http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2018-11/wada-meets-with-russian-authorities-regarding-moscow-laboratory-access,http://https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2018-12/update-on-wada-mission-to-extract-moscow-laboratory-data,http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2018-11/wada-meets-with-russian-authorities-regarding-moscow-laboratory-access,/a/28191918.html,http://https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-olympics-sport-doping-putin-wada-/28342809.html,http://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-01/statement-from-the-wada-athlete-committee-on-russian-compliance-situation;RT Claims WADA ‘Failed’ to Collect Data from Moscow Lab.

Some 1,700 journalists from around the world were accredited for the event.One journalist who received accreditation but was not allowed to attend was Roman Dobrokhotov, editor in chief of The Insider, a Russian investigative news site. Working with investigative group Bellingcat, The Insider uncovered the identities of GRU (Russian military intelligence) agents Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga (aka Ruslan Boshirov) and Alexander Mishkin (Alexander Petrov), the two men suspected of poisoning former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on March 4, 2018 in Salisbury, England.On Wednesday, December 19, the U.S. State and Treasury Departments sanctioned Chepiga and Mishkin for the failed attempt on Skripal’s life, which entailed the deployment of the military-grade nerve agent Novichok.At Putin’s December 20 question and answer session, the Russian president was asked by RT correspondent Ilya Petrenko about the reactions in the West to the poisoning of the Skripals and the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.RUSSIA -- A man drinks a coffee in front of screens broadcasting Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual press conference, at a bar in Moscow, December 20, 2018.Putin replied:“Khashoggi was killed; that’s obvious, all of this has been admitted. Sirkpal, thank God, is alive. Nevertheless, there are a bunch of sanctions against Russia. … But in the second case [Khashoggi], there is complete silence. This is a politicized Russophobic approach. It is a pretext, nothing more than a pretext to organize another attack on Russia. If it weren’t the Skripals, they would have come up with something else. That is obvious to me. And there is only one goal – to curb the development of Russia as a possible competitor. I don’t see any other goal.”All of these claims are false.Putin has a long history of characterizing Western reaction to Russian malfeasance as a pretext to contain Russia.For example, following Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, Putin claimed that if the “the so-called Crimean Spring” had never happened, the United States and its allies “would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain Russia’s growing capabilities, affect our country in some way, or even take advantage of it.”As previously reported by Polygraph.info, the evidence of Russian involvement in the Skripal poisoning is quite strong.The OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) confirmed that the substance used to poison the Skripals was Novichok, a chemical warfare agent developed by the former Soviet Union. The chemical had been smeared on the doorknob of Skripal’s front door, and CCTV footage showed the two suspected Russian GRU agents in Salisbury near the Skripal residence on the day of the poisoning. Traces of the same chemical were also found in the hotel room booked by the two suspects. A perfume bottle which British law enforcement authorities said held the chemical was also recovered near Salisbury.After being identified by British authorities, the two suspects appeared on Russian state TV and said they were only tourists working in the fitness and supplements industry. However, their story contained a number of significant inconsistencies and inaccuracies.Furthermore, Putin had previously called Skripal “scum” and “a traitor to his homeland”.During his annual news conference in 2010, Putin warned of a harsh fate for traitors, saying they would “choke on their 30 pieces of silver.”Skripal is not the first former Russian intelligence officer to be targeted on British soil.The Business Insider compiled a list of 15 deaths in Britain which intelligence authorities suspected may have involved Russia, including Alexander Litvinenko, a former officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB). He was poisoned by radioactive Polonium-210, believed to have been slipped into a cup of tea.Robert Owen, who carried out an inquest into the Litvinenko murder, found that the FSB operation to kill Litvinenko “was probably approved by [former FSB head and current Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai] Patrushev and also by President Putin.”U.K. -- In this image made available on November 25, 2006, Alexander Litvinenko is pictured at the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital on November 20, 2006 in London, England.As for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey consulate, it has been met with international condemnation, not silence.A Google News search for Skripal returned 922,000 results while a general Google search returned 7,630,000 results. By contrast, searches for Khashoggi returned 20,600,000 and 73,900,000 results, respectively.Jamal Khashoggi appeared on the front cover of one edition of Time’s 2018 Person of the Year issue.Time Mag chose Jamal Khashoggi as its person of the year 2018In November, the Trump administration sanctioned 17 individuals over their alleged roles in Khashoggi’s killing.""The Saudi officials we are sanctioning were involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. ""These individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions.""Canada soon followed suit.Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution directing the White House to halt all U.S. military assistance linked to Saudi Arabia‘s war effort in Yemen. That measure has been directly linked to the October 2 murder of Khashoggi.The U.S. Senate also passed a resolution condemning Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the assassination.As reported by NBC, Turkey “has put unprecedented political pressure on Riyadh” since the Khashoggi killing.Al Jazeera, citing the Wall Street Journal, reported that the “global outcry” over Khashoggi's murder and “fallout within the royal court” had diminished Bin Salman’s influence and “dampened Saudi Arabia's appetite for risky foreign policy endeavors,” as well as soured attempts at rapprochement with Israel.Therefore, Polygraph.info finds Putin’s most recent comments related to the Skripal poisoning to be false.";https://www.rferl.org/a/insider-out-journalist-who-helped-expose-novichok-suspects-barred-from-putin-press-conference/29667506.html,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/47173,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-evidence-in-salisbury-poisoning/29513455.html,http://(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-chemicalweapons-factbo/a-few-facts-about-the-nerve-agent-novichok-idUSKBN1JU2UW),https://www.polygraph.info/a/ex-russian-spy-poisoned-uk-fact-check/29087958.html,https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160613090757/https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/files/Litvinenko-Inquiry-Report-print-version.pdf,http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians-choice/,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/us-khashoggi-sanctions/index.html,https://globalnews.ca/news/4710925/canada-sanctions-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-murder/,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18139585/senate-yemen-saudi-arabia-resolution-khashoggi,https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/13/politics/corker-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi/index.html,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/16/turkish-foreign-minister-on-khashoggi-and-saudi-arabia.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/saudi-outreach-israel-faces-setbacks-khashoggi-crisis-181219094957532.html;Annual News Conference: Despite the Evidence, Putin Calls Skripal Poisoning a Pretext to Attack Russia;;;;;;

The attack came after Russian state TV accused Echo of Moscow—and Felgengauer specifically—of working for the U.S.Commenting on the Time’s choice of the Russian journalist, the head of the Kremlin’s broadcasting arm “Russiya Segodnya,” which includes RIA Novosti, Sputnik as well as most of Russia’s mainstream TV channels, Dmitry Kiselyov cried out “Hypocrisy!”Kiselyov claimed the inclusion of Felgengauer was inappropriate and done by the order of the American Russophobic establishment. He expressed outrage that the Time put the five journalists of the Annapolis newspaper Capital Gazette murdered on duty in a same group with Felgengauer, who suffered “a papercut” to her skin.Kiselyov’s claim is false.Tatiana Felgengauer was stabbed in her throat and seriously wounded. The doctors had to put her under induced coma for the surgery, after which she has spent two weeks in the hospital.As for the motives of the “mentally ill sex maniac” – that is a version supported by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin who said at the time, the attack had “nothing to do with freedom of speech,” but a work of a ""sick man.""After Putin’s comment, the court in Moscow declared the assailant mentally incapable and placed him in a psychiatric facility.Still, journalists inside and outside of Russia as well as opposition politicians said the attack was politically motivated, pointing to the attacker’s familiarity with the Echo Moskvy offices and Felgengauer’s schedule, as well as to his possession of the building’s blue prints.Kiselyov’s own channel Rossiya24 broadcast a series of TV reports targeting Felgengauer and Echo Moskvy saying the “danger such journalists pose is not less than the danger posed by the terrorist group ISIS (the Islamic State).”The Russian Journalists Trade Union said the attack was provoked by the Rossiya24 reports targeting Felgengauer as the “agent of the American State Department.” The Journalist Union called the attack an attack against freedom of speech.Well-known Russian Journalist Oleg Kashin said, the “mental diagnosis was faked specifically to cover up for the political motives.”While the suspicions cannot be verified at this time, a number of attacks on journalists in Russia have raised similar concerns.U.S. -- Jarrod Ramos, the suspected Capital Gazette newspaper shooter, undatedKiselyov tends to give credence to the Annapolis, Maryland attack and yet downplay the Felgengauer stabbing as the work of a mentally ill man. The defendant in Marmyland, however, also is considering an insanity plea. In October, the judge presiding over the case gave Jarrod Ramos’ lawyers 60 additional days to explore the 38-year-old suspect’s state of mind. Ramos' name was signed on letters written to the newspaper’s former lawyer and two judges, saying the writer wanted to kill everyone in the Annapolis newsroom. He pleaded not guilty in July, but has additional time to consider whether to claim insanity.Tatiana Felgengauer was laconic in her reaction to Kiselyov’s comment, “This is cute,” she wrote sharing the news on Twitter.​Kiselov’s comments drew a sharper response from Felgengauer’s editor:“Is anybody surprised, that Dmitry Kiselyov is a stinking scum?” the chief editor of Echo Moskvy Alexey Venediktov said in a post in his Telegram channel.Editors’ Note: In interest of full disclosure, Echo Moskvy publishes a blog online of select Polygraph.info fact checks.";http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/,http://www.thedailybeast.com/a-knife-in-the-throat-nearly-silences-a-top-independent-broacaster-in-moscow,/a/28571309.html,http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-gazette-shooting-20180628-story.html,http://echo.msk.ru/news/2078784-echo.html,http://zona.media/chronicle/felgengauer#15716,http://zona.media/chronicle/felgengauer#15594,http://youtu.be/gLUDLmykaOY,http://fn-volga.ru/news/view/id/74081,http://www.ruj.ru/news/novosti/v-redaktsii-ekha-moskvy-neizvestnyy-ranil-nozhom-zhurnalistku-tatyanu-felgengauer/,http://ura.news/news/1052309697,http://cpj.org/europe/russia/,http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/annapolis/ac-cn-plea-deadline-extended-20181023-story.html,http://t.me/aavst55/2373;Kremlin Media Chief Calls the Time '2018 Person of the Year' Choice of Russian Journalist ‘Hypocrisy’;;;;;;

Lavrov Says Plea Squeezed Out of Confessed Russian Agent;2018-12-17;polygraph;William Echols;"On Thursday, December 13, 2018, Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist, appeared before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she pleaded guilty to conspiring “to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government, specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General.”As part of the plea deal, Butina, who now faces a maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation, waived her right of appeal.Butina has further agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities in an ongoing investigation.U.S. -- In this courtroom sketch, Maria Butina, left, is shown next to her attorney Robert Driscoll, before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, during a court hearing at the U.S. District Court in Washington, December 13, 2018.In July, Butina was arrested and charged with conspiracy and working as an undeclared foreign agent of the Russian government. Prosecutors alleged she sought to cultivate ties with U.S. political groups and individuals – primarily conservatives – on behalf of Alexander Torshin, who resigned as deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank in November. Torshin, a former Russian senator, has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The former member of the Russian Council of Federation, Torshin was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April along with other Russian businessmen and politicians for “advancing Russia’s malign activities.”On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Butina pleaded guilty so that she could be “released as soon as possible and return to [her] homeland.”""I understand this woman: she is staying in the most difficult conditions and faced specific kind[s] of tortures for months: they either forcibly wake her up and let her walk in the night or place her in a solitary confinement cell, and so on. I have reasons to assume that the goal of the [detention] conditions that were created for her was to break her will and make her admit to something that she most probably did not commit,"" Lavrov said. Lavrov’s claims are unsubstantiated and misleading.In the U.S. 97% of Cases Resolved by PleaRegarding the plea bargaining system, Catherine Gallagher, an associate professor at George Mason University’s Criminology, Law and Society unit, told Polygraph.info that in the U.S., majority of cases “end up in a plea,” and very few people are actually tried in a court of law. “Maybe three percent of all cases actually go to trial. It was very unusual that [former Trump campaign chair Paul] Manafort, for example, went to trial. Most cases end up in a plea.”Her view lines up with an 84-page report released in July by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) on bargaining over criminal charges and defendants’ pleas. In it, the NACDL found that “after a 50 year decline, fewer than 3% of federal criminal cases result in a trial.”It continued: “With more than 97% of criminal cases being resolved by plea in a constitutional system predicated upon the Sixth Amendment right to a trial, the fact of imbalance and injustice in the system is self-evident.”The report said that in most primary offense categories, “the average post-trial sentence was more than triple the average post-plea sentence.”In Butina’s case, she originally faced up to 15 years in prison, but pleaded to a maximum of five years.U.S. - Accused Russian agent Maria Butina pleads guilty to a single conspiracy charge in a deal with prosecutors and admitted to working with a top Russian official to infiltrate a powerful gun rights group and influence U.S. policy toward Moscow.The Marshall Project, a nonprofit online journalism organization focusing on issues related to criminal justice in the U.S., similarly found that 97 percent of federal convictions and 94 percent of state convictions are the results of guilty pleas.Writing for the Atlantic in 2017, Emily Yoffe came to the following conclusion in a report from Nashville, Tennessee. “According to District Attorney Glenn Funk, Nashville–Davidson County handles about 100,000 criminal cases a year, 70 percent of which are misdemeanors, 30 percent felonies. Last year, attorneys in the public defender’s office dealt with 20,000 misdemeanors and 4,900 felony cases. Of all the defendants processed in Nashville–Davidson County last year, only 86 had their cases resolved at trial,” she wrote.Based on such statistics, U.S. District Judge John Kane argues, “the so-called trial court is not primarily a trial court at all. It is a plea bargaining court.”Lavrov’s ‘Propaganda War’As a result, Gallagher does not believe there was anything particularly unusual about Butina accepting a plea deal.“If her lawyers had thought there was a chance of going to trial and prevailing, then that’s what they would have done. Her lawyers were required to offer her the plea option,” she told Polygraph.info. Gallagher said there is an incentive for every pre-trial detainee to take a plea.“There’s a phrase called: the process is the punishment. You serve your whole punishment before you even get your sentence,” Gallagher said.As for the disinformation value of Lavrov’s statements, Gallagher said that claiming Butina was unduly pressured to plea is “very hard to argue in the U.S. because it’s the norm.”U.S. -- A courtroom sketch depicts Maria Butina, listening to Assistant U.S. Attorney Erik Kenerson as he speaks to Judge Deborah Robinson, left, during a hearing in federal court in Washington, July 18, 2018.“If America is the audience [for Lavrov’s statements] they are not going to win this propaganda war. But in Russia it’s easy,” Gallagher said.Butina Denied any Physical or Psychological Pressure Regarding allegations of torture, Polygraph.info previously found there is a basis for saying extended time in solitary does constitute mistreatment or torture.In 2013, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Juan Méndez, urged that solitary confinement, if imposed at all, is only used “in exceptional circumstances.”In 2011, Mendez said solitary confinement should be banned as “a punishment or extortion technique.” But that conclusion is not universal, as some scholarly studies have concluded otherwise.Gallagher said that while she personally considers solitary confinement to be “a form of torture,” that view is currently not shared by the United States Supreme Court.“Isolation is brutalizing -- not because you’re being abused, but because it’s very tough. It breaks a person in different ways. Some people are more resilient than others. No one comes out better than they come in,” Gallagher said.“Did it in fact expedite her willingness to plea? One can absolutely hypothesize yes, ” Gallagher added.But she said that ultimately, “whether or not Butina was in isolation, based on the evidence, it’s very likely her lawyers would have pushed her to take the plea.”As it stands, there is no evidence that Butina faced conditions that are peculiar to the U.S. criminal justice system. The argument over reforming that system is a separate issue. In earlier media reports, the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to questions regarding Butina’s isolation. During the hearing for the change of plea Butina and her lawyers denied any physical or psychological pressure telling the judge the decision to enter the plea deal was voluntary.Butina’s attorney Robert Driscoll told the court his client is allowed a “time out of her cell, daily activities and visitations, including those from the representatives of the Russian foreign ministry,” and that she is “doing well and competent.”Official Twitter accounts of the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian Mission to the UN with photograph of Maria Butina as their profile picture.As for Lavrov’s claim that Butina confessed to the crime she did not commit, Butina’s own words contradict this statement.When asked by the judge, “Are you pleading guilty not for any other reason but because you are guilty?” Butina answered, “Yes, guilty.”Thus, Lavrov’s claim that Butina was pressured to confess to a crime she did not commit is misleading at best.";https://www.nacdl.org/trialpenaltyreport/,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/26/plea-bargaining-and-the-innocent,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/26/plea-bargaining-and-the-innocent,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-butina-us-passport-nra-russiagate/29631014.html;Breaking Butina?

Kiselyov, who also heads the government-owned international media agency Rossiya Segodnya, that includes RIA Novosti and Sputnik, said the idea that rap came to Russia via African-American culture in the 1990’s is erroneous. Russian rap’s real predecessor, he said, was the poetic tradition of the famous Soviet poet and writer, Vladimir Mayakovsky.Dmitry Kiselyov raps some verses from Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky​Kiselyov then demonstrated this by rapping some verses from Mayakovsky over a beat. While Kiselyov’s hip-hop debut is noteworthy, it’s important to remember that Mayakovsky’s poetry was not intended to be spoken over music, although in his early career Mayakovsky sought to make poetry accessible to mass audiences -- ""to 'depoetize' poetry, adopting the language of the streets and using daring technical innovations,"" writes Encyclopaedia Britannica. More importantly, Russian hip-hop, like hip-hop in many countries worldwide, does indeed take its inspiration from African-American culture.Russian hip-hop’s origins are typically attributed to a 1984 album by the group Chas Pik (Rush Hour) entitled, appropriately, “Rap.” The Moscow Times, in a March 2017 article, traced the Russian origin to Chas Pik. Much of the album does not feature rap, but the parts that do sound very similar to the 1981 Blondie song “Rapture,” both in terms of the melody and the rhythm of the lyrics. Incidentally, “Rapture” was the first number one song on the U.S. charts to feature rap lyrics, and it did very well abroad as well. Russian rap gained in popularity near the end of the Soviet period, with the first rap festival being held in 1990 in Moscow’s Gorky Park.Compare with Blondie's ""Rapture"":The music critic who chaired the jury at that first festival, Artemy Troitsky, pointed out in the Moscow Times article that a 1991 hit song by the rap group, Malchishnik, was typical of the sex and drugs appeal of the genre, the Times saying the group was “clearly imitating the Beastie Boys,” an American hip hop group.Since then, hip-hop and rap have gained mainstream popularity in Russia, and though like their counterparts in the rest of the world, they have introduced elements of Russian music, culture and politics into their art. That being said, rap’s roots are clearly in the African-American community, and they can arguably be traced back even further to the griots, traditional West African storytellers who performed their stories in rhythmic verse with musical accompaniment.​";https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/11/30/russian-musicians-are-being-forced-to-cancel-their-concerts-across-the-country-which-makes-now-the-perfect-time-to-listen-to-their-music,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Vladimirovich-Mayakovsky,https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/gangstas-paradise-how-rap-became-russian-57319,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3622406.stm;Russian State News Chief Raps on Air, Claims Russian Rap Is Home Grown;;;;;;

The film was eventually approved for release in Russia with significant delay in its schedule.After bantering with Andrey Kolesnikov about the plot of the film, Putin calls it “unlikely” and “fantastic.”“Two little cutters that the United States gifted Ukraine didn’t pass through the Kerch Straight, and you want a nuclear submarine visiting our base? A bad film,” Putin said dismissively before ending the press conference.Putin refers to the incident occurred on November 25, when Russian Coast Guard boats attempted to stop a Ukrainian tugboat as it was on its way to transit the Kerch Strait from the Black Sea into the Azov Sea, between Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. The incident ended with Russian vessels firing on two Ukrainian naval patrol boats that came to the aid of the tug, and Russian forces capturing all three Ukrainian vessels along with their crews.Kerch - A video posted on Facebook by Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov that appears to show the Russian coast-guard vessel ramming the Ukrainian Navy tugboat:But Putin’s claim that the two ships were “gifted” by the U.S. is false.The two patrol boats, “Berdyansk” and “Nikopol”, have already been identified as Gyurza-M-class artillery boats, which are manufactured by the Kyiv-based Kuznya na Rybalskomu ship building and armament firm.When claiming the two seized boats were a gift to Ukraine from the U.S. the Russian president might have confused them with two different ships Ukraine agreed in September to accept from the U.S. – Island-class patrol boats as free military aid.“This aid is especially crucial at a time when Russia is undermining the freedom of navigation in the Sea of Azov, cowardly hunting and intimidating commercial ships,” Ukrainian President Petro Porohsenko said at the time.“Our task is to convince the Kremlin that we are committed to defending Ukraine’s shores.”Those outdated vessels, manufactured for the U.S. Coast Guard from 1985-92, are intended to help Ukraine create a so-called ""Mosquito fleet"" – with a focus on quick deployment covering a large area.The aim is to counter what Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., called Russia’s attempt to “militarize the Azov” during an interview with Defense One.UKIRAINE -- Ukrainian soldier stands guard aboard a military boat called the ""Dondass"" moored at Mariupol, Sea of Azov port, November 27, 2018.But the ships seized by Russia on November 25 were Ukrainian, and not American-made and so we judge Putin’s claim to be false.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-hunter-killer-censored-russia/29584043.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-coast-guard-rams-ukrainian-tugboat-official-denies-fact-check/29622245.html,http://www.navalanalyses.com/2017/11/gurza-m-class-armored-artillery-boats.html,https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/ukraine-accepts-two-us-patrol-boats-after-four-years-of-bureaucratic-blockades.html,https://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1647624-optimalniy-variant-rozvitku-vms-ukrayini-stvorennya-moskitnogo-flotu-vms-zsu,https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/09/ukraine-building-mosquito-navy-fend-russia-us-help/151606/;Putin Falsely Claims Seized Ukrainian Ships Gifted by U.S.A.;;;;;;

That runs contrary to Russian journalist Vadim Gorshenin’s claim that Butina was set to receive U.S. citizenship “after months of torture in an American prison.”Her lawyers had previously argued that ""prolonged depravation of human contact and interaction is starting to have a profound psychological impact” on their client. But when asked, in the courtroom, if she was of sound mind to make the plea, Butina said that she was not suffering from mental illness or undue psychological stress. Accordingly, we have changed the verdict of the fact check from ""unclear"" to ""false."" _____________________________________________________________The original wording of the fact check: As the Russian Foreign Ministry uses her photograph for its profile picture on social media accounts, Maria Butina is set to be granted U.S. citizenship, “shame for Fatherland” – a Russian journalist wrote in his channel in the Telegram messenger on November 29. The post instantly became viral, shared by the most influential Telegram channels. We find no evidence to back this up. In July, Maria Butina was arrested and charged with conspiracy and working as an undeclared foreign agent of the Russian government. Prosecutors allege she sought to cultivate ties with U.S. political groups and individuals -- primarily conservatives -- on behalf of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank and a former Russian senator with alleged ties to the Russian mafia.U.S. -- A photo provided by the Alexandria, Detention Center shows Maria Butina.Torshin and Butina worked to establish a relationship between the National Rifle Association and a Russian analog which Butina set up in 2011 – “Right to Bear Arms.” That relationship was allegedly used as the springboard to establish a “backchannel” that “could be used by the Russian Federation to penetrate the U.S. national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.”Torshin was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April along with other Russian businessmen and politicians for “advancing Russia’s malign activities.”A screenshot of Maria Butina's vKontakte post with a pphotograph of her next to Alexander Torshin in Washington, DCButina’s attorneys say their client was “nothing more than a student with an interest in U.S. politics who hoped to improve bilateral relations.”On Wednesday, November 28, a federal judge rejected Butina’s request that she be removed from solitary confinement and moved to general population at a detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, where she is being housed.In a filling submitted by her lawyers on Tuesday, November 27, Butina’s lawyer said “she has now been in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day for 6 consecutive days with no prospective release date.” They added that if the court fails to intervene, “she will continue to be held in this manner and ultimately require the attention of mental health professionals.”Her lawyers said she had briefly been placed in general population after spending over two months in solitary confinement, only to be returned to solitary confinement on November 21 after allegedly providing another inmate her lawyer’s cell phone number.On Thursday, November 29, Russia’s High Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova requested that Butina’s “harsh” conditions be eased.Also on November 29, Butina’s father Valery told the Tass news agency he expects his daughter to make a pretrial deal with the prosecution. Press accounts earlier in the month indicated a similar outcome.The same day, Russian journalist Vadim Gorshenin wrote in a post on Telegram that it was the Russian Foreign Ministry’s “shame” that it was not “prepared for real actions to protect the rights of Russian citizens.”Stating “it is not clear what’ Butina was arrested for, Gorshenin said it would be possible to “arrest more than a dozen American citizens” in Moscow on the same grounds given for Butina’s arrest.He concluded that Butina “will be granted American citizenship” after months of torture in an American prison, adding that he is “ashamed for my Fatherland.”There is a basis for saying Butina’s extended time in solitary does constitute torture.Official Twitter accounts of the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian Mission to the UN with photograph of Maria Butina as their profile picture.In 2013, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Juan Méndez, urged that solitary confinement, if imposed at all, is only used “in exceptional circumstances.”In 2011, Mendez said solitary confinement should be banned as “a punishment or extortion technique.”“Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pretrial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles,” he said.U.S. -- Maria Butina (second right) poses with protesters in Washington, D.C. Sept 2016.But that conclusion is not universal, as some scholarly studies have concluded otherwise. For example, a study by University of British Columbia scholars found that there are no “dramatic differences” between convicts who have experienced solitary confinement versus those who haven’t. The authors studied actual convicts, whose experiences they found “do not support the view that [solitary confinement] in prisons is universally damaging, aversive, or intolerable.”Gorshenin’s claim of Butina being granted U.S. citizenship appears to be baseless, possibly confusing her case with those of a few spies who have secured citizenship. Butina is not specifically accused of spying, but instead acting as an undeclared foreign agent.For argument’s sake, let’s look at spies and citizenship. As a general rule, individuals caught spying under diplomatic cover are arrested and then expelled. Spies caught operating without diplomatic cover are open to prosecution and incarceration, although they can be exchanged in spy swaps, as was the case in the so-called “Illegals Program”.The history of when and how former Russian agents and defectors have secured U.S. citizenship is complicated, as demonstrated by the case of Janosh and Victorya Neumann, in particular. The couple offered information to the CIA, but in complicated set of circumstances ended up hiring a lawyer in order to win “immigration status” in the U.S.RUSSIA -- Maria Butina, a gun-rights activist poses for a photo at a shooting range in Moscow, April 22, 2012.Even if Butina were to reach a plea agreement, that would not be equivalent with working to help a U.S spy agency. And no federal prosecutor or any other U.S. official has suggested Butina will be granted U.S. citizenship, either as a part of a yet-to-be-finalized plea deal or for any other reason. Nor has the government said the oppositePolygraph.info, therefore, finds Gorshenin’s claim on citizenship to be unclear, though his claim of “torture” in reference to the solitary confinement is a subject of the ongoing debate.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/maria-butina-lavrov-trumped-up/29387925.html,https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1080766/download,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/court-rejects-accused-russian-spy-maria-butinas-request-to-be-moved-from-solitary-confinement/,https://www.apnews.com/7edf9ff512a72c3dbbf6c46f5e139117,http://tass.com/society/1033455,http://tass.com/world/1033456,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/butina-in-negotiations-with-prosecutors-over-potential-resolution-to-her-case,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854882009003004,https://www.rferl.org/a/Spy_Defection_Roils_Russian_Intelligence_Service_/2218715.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/russian-defectors-spies-dead-end-american-dream,https://www.wildeslaw.com/immigration-resources/latest-immigration-news/immigration-status-secured-for-former-russian-fsb-officers;Updated: Russian Agent Butina Set for US Citizenship, Journalist Claims Without Evidence;;;;;;

When a Russian coast guard vessel rammed a Ukrainian naval tugboat, Russian vessels fired shots at the tug and two Ukrainian patrol boats near the Kerch Strait. At the VTB Bank Investment Forum in Moscow, Putin answered reporters’ questions – making a number of statements that are either false, unverified, or possibly true but in a misleading way. You can watch what he said and our verdicts in the video here: EmbedsharePolygraph Putin FactcheckEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:02:550:00Read more about it below: PUTIN: “In regards to the incident in the Black Sea – that, without a doubt, was a provocation.”TRUE: This may be true, but if so, it was a Russian provocation, not a Ukrainian one. The Russian ships engaged the Ukrainian boats aggressively, even as the Ukrainian naval boats acted in accordance with a bilateral treaty signed by Putin in 2003.The treaty grants free passage through the Kerch strait to commercial and naval vessels of Ukraine and Russia. The Ukrainian Navy claims their vessel gave notification of its intent to transit the strait. PUTIN: “A provocation, organized by the current Ukrainian authorities, I think by the current president ahead of presidential elections in Ukraine in March of the next year.”FALSE: Putin is implying that the incident was organized by Ukrainian President Poroshenko in order to justify calling off elections scheduled for next year via his decree of martial law. However, the period of martial law will expire on December 26, months before the election, and will only include areas of the country embroiled in conflict.___________________________________________________________PUTIN: “Something needed to be done to escalate the situation and create insurmountable obstacles for his contestants, especially those from the opposition.”UNCLEAR: This is unclear, because it is unverifiable. Although it is true that Putin’s own approval rating has been boosted by military adventures abroad._____________________________________________________________PUTIN: “…in 2014 when Crimea decided to join Russia...”FALSE: The Crimea didn’t “decide to join Russia.” The Russian military took the peninsula in unmarked uniforms and the part of the region “voted” under Russian occupation. _____________________________________________________________PUTIN: “The hard events of a civil war in Ukraine in the south-east in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.”FALSE: There is no civil war in those regions, but rather a Russian invasion and occupation._____________________________________________________________PUTIN: “So what happened now? They did not respond to requests from our border guard, they entered our territorial waters, the waters that were our territorial even before Crimea has joined the Russian Federation.”FALSE: Use of the strait is governed by the bilateral treaty between the two countries renewed in 2003.By agreement, the the strait and the sea of Azov are considered internal waters of both Ukraine and Russia, and provides for free passage for vessels of both nations.A maritime expert, and radio intercepts, placed the vessels at the 12 nautical mile point in the Black Sea, where Crimean territorial waters end.(see original fact check on this topic, linked above)_____________________________________________________________PUTIN: “Today authorities in Kyiv successfully sell anti-Russian sentiments; they have nothing else left to sell.”MISLEADING: Anti-Russian sentiments in Ukraine follow the Russian invasion and occupation of its territory – Crimea in early 2014 and the ongoing Eastern Ukraine conflict, fomented by Russian actors._____________________________________________________________PUTIN: “No matter what they (Ukrainians) do, they get away with it. If they demand today infants for breakfast, they, probably, will be served infants”FALSE: Ukraine’s leadership is routinely criticized by Western governments and human rights watchdogs on a number of topics from corruption and slow reforms, to failure to uphold human rights and press freedom.";https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/11/f/ff/ff47bd23-336c-4921-a1c8-3168a360d88f_mobile.mp4,/a/eight-putin-claims-regarding-kerch-strait-fact-check/6740922.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740922.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740922.html&text=Polygraph+Putin+Factcheck,/a/6740922.html,/embed/player/Article/6740922.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-coast-guard-rams-ukrainian-tugboat-official-denies-fact-check/29622245.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russian-ship-rams-navy-tugboat-off-crimea-azov/29619665.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukraine-martial-law-war-elections-fact-check/29622298.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/jul/23/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-at-record-levels,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-crimea-land-grab/29496991.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-ukraine-russia-donbas/28912097.html,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-01/ukraine-reforms-stall-as-economy-lags-and-corruption-lingers,http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-corruption-actually-works-in-ukraine,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-far-right-radicals-attack-lgbt-demonstrators/29607176.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-eu-warn-ukraine-sedletska-ruling-endangers-press-freedom-corruption-fight/29473976.html;Video Fact Check: 8 Putin Claims Regarding the Kerch Strait Incident;;;;;;

Ruptly.tv is correct that the original fact check did not note the full video was published the next day, November 26. (Click here to watch it).However, we have confirmed the full version of the video was available on Sunday, November 24, the day before Ruply.tv published the abridged video.Several Russian state-owned TV channels broadcasted the full version of the video on November 25. That includes the state TV channel Rossiya-24, with its flagship news show Vesti.We have no means to independently confirm that Ruptly.tv did not edit the first, shorter version, of the video, which is posted on its website and also put out on social media – the video we featured in the original fact check.Below is the original fact check:On November 25, Ruptly, the video service of the Russian state-owned media outlet RT, released a video purporting to show Russian Coast Guard vessels intercepting Ukrainian vessels that had allegedly “breached Russian waters.” A comparison with the same video as shown by Western news web sites reveals a very important difference.The Ruptly video leaves out the most important part of the original video – which showed the Ukrainian tugboat slowing to a stop. The original video, shot from the Russian Coast Guard vessel shows it holding its course until it rams the stopped tugboat.After the edit, we see the tug moving away from the Russian vessel again, and a Ukrainian navy patrol boat moves in front of the Russian ship’s bow from port to starboard. From accounts of the incident, two Ukrainian patrol boats responded to the tugboat’s distress call after it was rammed by the Russian vessel. Both of these boats were fired upon, with some Ukrainian crew members suffering minor wounds before they were captured along with their vessels. After this brief scene, during which the Ukrainian patrol boat is visible for a few seconds, the Ruptly video loops back to the beginning.Also missing is the original audio. In the original video, a Russian voice is heard onboard the Coast Guard ship, cursing and shouting orders at the Ukrainian tugboat crew. He then can be heard apparently ordering his subordinates to ram the tugboat. The more complete version is on the BBC YouTube channel: Lastly, the video’s title claims that the Ukrainian vessels had breached Russian waters. On Monday Polygraph.info quoted a Ukrainian maritime expert, publisher of the Black Sea News, who released an analysis showing that the Ukrainian ship was at the 12-mile coastal boundary, at the boundary of international waters, off the coast of Crimea which Ukraine still claims. As for the Kerch Strait itself, which is well less than 12 miles wide, a treaty from 2003 between Russia and Ukraine designates the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov as “internal waters” of both Russia and Ukraine, and grants freedom of passage to both Russian and Ukrainian commercial and military vessels.;http://ruptly.tv/vod/20181126-018,https://youtu.be/oWDbZAJQrtA,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-coast-guard-rams-ukrainian-tugboat-official-denies-fact-check/29622245.html,http://maritimebulletin.net/2018/11/26/kerch-strait-incident-in-detail-analysis/;Correction: Russian Media Outlet Claims Short Kerch Strait Ramming Video Was not Edited;;;;;;

Her full statement:“After the murder of [former DNR leader] Alexander Zakharchenko under the conditions of a possible vacuum of power, there was a real risk of the total destabilization of the situation in southeastern Ukraine. This, against the backdrop of the trade and economic blockade imposed by Kyiv and the constant threat of the use of force coming from the Ukrainian leadership, could have negatively affected life in the Donbas and the settlement process in general. The holding of elections made it possible to avoid such a scenario.”But her claims of stability comes amid reports of 16 attacks on Ukrainian army positions in eastern Ukraine over a 24-hour period on November 15 and 16, leaving two soldiers wounded. The press center of Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation also said “three occupiers” were killed and another five were wounded.Screen shot from liveuamap.com showing military incidents in Eastern Ukraine for November 16, 2018.Russia claims the catalyst for a potential political vacuum was the murky assassination of former DNR head Aleksandr Zakharchenko. Mirroring Zakharova’s language, Russian President Vladimir Putin said those who carried out the murder were “making a dangerous bet on the destabilization of the situation” in the Donbas.But writing for Spiegel Online, Christian Neef argued there is now a “broad consensus” that Zakharchenko was killed either by Russian security forces or by people from within his own camp.Russian reports looking to pin blame on Kyiv have only served to raise more questions than answers.EmbedshareAssassination of Aleksandr ZakharchenkoEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:160:00In any case, violent transfers of power have become a common occurrence in the region. Like Pushilin, Pasechnik, previously LNR security minister, initially came to power not through democratic means: he became the LNR’s acting leader after former LNR head Igor Plotnitsky fled to Russia following an armed putsch in November 2017.As Spiegel Online’s Neef noted, Igor Girkin, the onetime leader of the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and former DNR defense minister, said ""bandits"" had taken power in both self-declared republics. Girkin also asserted that the Donbas is ""simply getting robbed.""“Many of the recent murders may have been part of a brutal battle for influence and riches,” Neef wrote, adding that the markets and companies ""nationalized"" by Zakharchenko “are now being returned to their rightful owners.”UKRAINE – Igor Strelkov, 2nd left, attends the wedding ceremony of now-deceased platoon commander Arsen Pavlov, also known as Motorola in the city of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, on July 11, 2014.​Meanwhile, the Jamestown Foundation’s Vladimir Socor has argued that “the violent removal” of Plotnitsky and Zakharchenko contributed to the holding of the November 11 elections, but were not the determining factor.“These were predictable and almost foreordained by the quadrennial ‘electoral’ cycle that the Kremlin and the DPR-LPR need to perpetuate in the occupied territory,” he wrote. “The ‘republics’ should at least pretend to observe some formal electoral procedures, and generate for their leaders at regular intervals the semblance of a popular mandate. This could strengthen their claim for acceptance de facto as negotiating parties (even short of formal recognition) and make it possible for Russia on the international level to portray its hand-picked proxies as emanations of the local population.""Ultimately, Russia itself has been pivotal in fomenting and perpetuating armed conflict in eastern Ukraine since the start of hostilities in 2014.UKRAINE – Denis Pushilin (2nd L front), representative of “DPR”, and Alexander Zakharchenko (2nd R front), head of the “DPR”, attend the commemorative events in memory of the people, who died during Boeing 777 crash on 17 July 2014.As Polygraph.info previously reported, there is abundant verifiable evidence of the presence of Russian military hardware, troops, intelligence agents, and economic aid from Russia in the Donbas conflict.President Putin himself once admitted to having some military personnel in the Donbas. Talking heads on Russia state media have similarly made an about-face and admitted the presence of Russian special services operating in eastern Ukraine, saying it would be “stupid to deny that.”Zakharova is essentially arguing that a conflict for which Russia has served as both the impetus and fuel risks spiraling out of control because the previous two leaders in the Russian-occupied territories were violently ousted, potentially at the behest of Moscow and/or its proxies -- and that now the situation has stabilized because those who were already operating with impunity have been “legitimized” by elections that much of the Western world condemned as a sham. Whether or not the arguments that Russia had a hand in the violent transfers of power are true, Russia’s violent military actions in Donetsk and Luhansk are the de-stabilizing force. And so we find that Zakharova’s claim is false.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-state-media-proclaims-the-elections-in-donetsk-democratic-based-on-unqualified-observers-/29596667.html,http://tass.com/world/1030367,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fake-election-monitors/29109864.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-state-media-proclaims-the-elections-in-donetsk-democratic-based-on-unqualified-observers-/29596667.html,https://www.unian.info/war/10339650-two-ukrainian-troops-wounded-in-donbas-in-past-24-hours.html,http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/moscow-meddling-the-forgotten-war-in-eastern-ukraine-a-1238044.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/ukraine-assassination-zakhrachenko-bombing-conspiracy-/29534067.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/11/7/7d/7df3ec43-480f-4db0-9621-15cdb86c3e50_mobile.mp4,/a/election-donbass-stability-ukraine/6740918.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740918.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740918.html&text=Assassination+of+Aleksandr+Zakharchenko,/a/6740918.html,/embed/player/Article/6740918.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/moscow-meddling-the-forgotten-war-in-eastern-ukraine-a-1238044.html,https://jamestown.org/program/elections-staged-in-ukraines-east-under-russian-control/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-ukraine-military-presence-kremlin/28340880.html;Moscow Claims 'Sham' Donbas Election Stems Chaos it Sowed;;;;;;

The report contains a full list of election ""observers,"" along with their party affiliations if known. The report can be found here.On November 11, authorities in the Russian-occupied, self-proclaimed “Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” held elections which were roundly condemned by the Ukrainian government. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv called the elections a “sham,” while the European Union issued a statement declaring them to be “illegal and illegitimate,” and stating that the E.U. would not recognize them. The German and French government also issued similar statements condemning the elections.On November 12, however, Russian state media agencies reported the results of the elections, and RIA Novosti reported that the elections were “democratic and open” according to observers. Russia has a history of using unqualified election observers both for elections within Russia and in the territories it controls by proxy. Polygraph.info has reported on this practice on several occasions. Typically the observers are a mixture of openly pro-Moscow individuals from various far-right and sometimes far-left European political parties. This election appears to be no exception. For example, the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group noted that one of the requirements for being an election observer is that the individual monitors do not reside within the territory of the DNR or LNR. However, some observers clearly do reside within those territories, and some of them have either actively engaged in pro-”separatist” activities or, in one case, have actually served in the military forces of the Russian-led “republics.” UKRAINE -- An election campaign billboard in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed separatists is seen on a street in Donetsk, November 5, 2018.For example, one of the “observers” was Janus Putkonen, a Finnish citizen who not only resides in occupied Donetsk, but also founded a media outlet there. A Vice reporter detailed an encounter with Putkonen in Donetsk, where he was also serving in the “republic’s” information ministry and vetting all foreign reporters working within the territory. He has reportedly lived in Donetsk since 2015, meaning that even by the pseudo-state’s own regulations, he would be disqualified.One story from the Russian news agency TASS quotes one “observer” named Artur Leier, who is described as an assistant to a member of the Hamburg parliament. However, it turns out that Mr. Leier is a representative of the “Eurasian Society of Germany.” In a video from April 19, 2018, Leier is interviewed by a pro-Kremlin “journalist” Caleb Maupin in Yalta, in Russian-occupied Crimea. The United Nations, in a report on election observation for its publication ""Women Watch"" pointed to the need for impartial observers, assembled from outside the election location:“International observation groups usually keep themselves separate from domestic groups in order to preserve their image of impartiality, since the credibility of their assessment and conclusions will depend to a large extent on whether they are perceived as neutral and impartial,” the report stated, noting there can be advantages to having a “domestic” monitoring team working with international observers. In Donetsk, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not carry out any observation of the elections.UKRAINE -- Members of the Organization for OSCE Observer Mission, Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, arrive for the test flight of the unmanned aerial vehicle Camcopter S-100 along the eastern front line near the village of Stepanivka in the Donetsk, March 28, 2018.“Although I don’t know who exactly might have observed over this weekend, there was no one involved from the OSCE,” a spokesperson from the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights wrote in response to Polygraph.info. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which observes other activities in the territories, did mention the elections in a recent spot report, but could not comment on their authenticity. “On 11 November, in non-government-controlled Donetsk city, the SMM observed a slight increase in the presence of armed formations members in some areas of the city centre,” the report states. “It saw buildings with signs that read ‘polling stations’, with two to four people in full combat gear and with assault rifles present outside most of them. In the vicinity, the SMM saw stalls similar to market ones.” ""Elections"" in Russian-occupied Donetsk in Ukraine.Beyond this, the report states that “Other civilians separately shared concerns that people felt compelled ‘to vote’, as otherwise they would face interruption of salaries or health care in non-government-controlled areas.”In regards to international election monitoring missions, the Carter Center, the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute developed a set of principles for election monitoring, which the organizations say serve as “professional guidelines for election observations” – guidelines endorsed by more than 50 organizations.The principles noted by the Carter Center include a lengthy process.“Election observation missions start long before election day, with experts and long-term observers analyzing election laws, assessing voter education and registration, and evaluating fairness in campaigns,” the Carter Center Democracy Program states on its Web site.Election day tasks include polling place observation, that continues for “days and weeks after the election” as observers evaluation vote tabulation, any disputes over the election and final results.TASS reported on the day of the Donetsk election that “foreign observers” arrived just the day before the election.The TASS article noted that the delegation from Russia included members of the Federation Council and Russia and that observers who arrived on Saturday came from Abkhazia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, France, and South Ossetia. We have not seen a full list of the foreign observers.'Election Context' Novaya Gazeta reported November 12 that only Russian state media were allowed to be present at polling stations and that ""Russian, Ukrainian and foreign media were allowed on the territory of the republics.""Interestingly, the newspaper reported that Kremlin officials had declined to recognize the legitimacy of the election, only that they ""respect"" the outcome. UKRAINE – Kurt Volker, Special Representative of the US Department of State for Ukraine, in Slavyansk among journalists and visitors to the press-center. Donetsk Region, Sloviansk, May 15, 2018.Only days before the election, U.S. State Department Special Representative Kurt Volker in a conference call with reporters November 8 called the elections ""a mockery"" where people under occupation have ""no freedom of choice.""He called for a UN peacekeeping mission to create security and conditions for free elections ​.""With the UN forces there you would need a period of time to organize elections, to allow for registration, to allow for candidates, to allow for campaigning, and to have those elections go forward,"" said Volker answering the question of a TASS writer. And so our judgment is that a statement the day after that “the elections were democratic and open” can only be judged as false, given the lack of professional standards and what we know of the make-up of those who arrived Saturday.";https://www.epde.org/en/news/details/foreign-observation-of-the-illegitimate-general-elections-Donetsk-Lugansk.html,https://www.epde.org/en/news/details/foreign-observation-of-the-illegitimate-general-elections-Donetsk-Lugansk.html?file=files/EPDE/RESSOURCES/2018%20Elections%20in%20DNR%20LNR/Foreign%20Observation%20of%20the%20Illegitimate%20General%20Elections%20in%20the%20DPR%20and%20LPR%20FINAL.pdf,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/11/10/declaration-of-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-the-elections-planned-in-the-so-called-luhansk-people-s-republic-and-donetsk-people-s-republic-for-11-november-2018/,https://www.unian.info/politics/10333536-germany-france-say-donbas-elections-illegal.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-fake-election-monitors/29109864.html,http://anton-shekhovtsov.blogspot.com/2014/03/pro-russian-extremists-observe.html,http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1541719404,http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1508187981,https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/neyqa8/inside-rebel-held-ukraines-palaces-of-propaganda,http://tass.com/world/1030317,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HSB2zaLTF0,http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/wps/publication/Chapter7.htm,https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/402713,https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/index.html,https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/democracy/des/declaration_code_english_revised.pdf,http://tass.com/world/1030261,https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2018/11/12/78551-ukraine-plevat-da-i-nam-tozhe?utm_source=novaya&utm_medium=tw&utm_campaign=regular;UPDATED: Russian State Media Proclaims the Elections in Donetsk ‘Democratic’ – Based on Unqualified Observers;;;;;;
347;;;;Misleading;Vladimir Zhirinovsky;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/zhirinovsky-ukraine-history-fact-check/6741985.html;Fiery Russian Nationalist Politico Denies Ukraine History;2018-11-11;polygraph;William Echols;"As a guest on the November 8 edition of Rossiya-1 state television’s “Evening with Vladimir Solovyov” program, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), said he considers Ukraine his “homeland” and the “grave of his ancestors.” Zhirinovsky’s paternal grandfather, in fact, was a wealthy industrialist from Kostopil, Ukraine, who operated a timber factory there. He has asked successive Ukrainian governments to return that facility to him.Zhirinovsky, however, accused the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv of hypocrisy for condemning the “sham elections” in “the pseudo-republics Russia created in eastern Ukraine.”“The Europeans and Americans always evoke democracy and elections and free speech but do the exact opposite,” Zhirinovsky said, before going off on a tangent about Americans probably “losing their mind” amid a spate of mass shootings.The position of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is that the elections in eastern Ukraine are internationally illegitimate, “are not in line with either the Minsk agreements or Ukrainian law”, and are ultimately “a charade since the Kremlin has already anointed leaders to serve as its proxies in the so-called ‘DPR’ and ‘LPR’” – the Russian-backed self-proclaimed “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine.During his appearance on Solovyov’s program, launched into one of his trademark “history” lessons, declaring: “Ukrainians in the Polish Army in 1612 already seized Moscow. Can you imagine? Of course it was a big government, a commonwealth, with Poles and Lithuanians, there could have been people who weren’t Poles, and those who would later call themselves Ukrainians, but in 1612 the word ‘Ukraine’ was not heard anywhere.”Russian nationalists have long sought to deny the existence of an independent Ukrainian people or language.For example, in 1863, a secret decree issued by the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, which essentially banned the printing of the Ukrainian language, said that “no separate Little Russian [Ukrainian] language ever existed, doesn’t exist, and couldn’t exist.” In effect, the document claimed the Ukrainian language was nothing more than Russian corrupted by Polish influence.Yana Prymachenko, a senior researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine’s Institute of History of Ukraine, told Polygraph.info that Russian nationalists do not believe that Ukraine could exist as an independent state, adding that Putin himself called Ukraine an artificial state.UKRAINE – St. Andrew's Church in Kyiv, which the Parliament of Ukraine decided to convey to the Ecumenical Patriarchate for free use. The church was built in the years 1747-1762Speaking at the Selgier Youth Forum in 2014, Putin said: “There are historians here, and people with their own views on our country’s history might argue with me, but I think that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one single people, no matter what others might say.”In 2015, Putin reiterated that point: ""Friends, we in Russia always saw the Russians and Ukrainians as a single people. I still think this way now,” he said at a concert in Moscow marking the one year anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. And at a 2008 NATO Summit in Paris he allegedly told then-U.S.President George Bush: “Ukraine is not even a state. What is Ukraine? Part of its territories are in Eastern Europe, but the greater part is a gift from us.""Zhirinovsky himself has called Ukraine an “artificial state cobbled together by the Bolsheviks.”But the historical record paints a different picture. The word Ukraina (Ukraine) first appears in the Hypatian Codex, a compilation of three primary historical chronicles, in 1187. According to the Encyclopedia of Ukraine, “the terms Ukrainiany appears in the chronicle under the year 1268.”“Ukrainnyky, and even narod ukrainskyi (the Ukrainian people) were used sporadically before Ukraintsi attained currency under the influence of the writings of Ukrainian activists in Russian-ruled Ukraine in the 19th century,” according to the encyclopedia.Guillaume de Beauplan Map.As noted by Prymachenko, the 1652 Guillaume de Beauplan map presents the territory included within modern day Ukraine as “Ukraina.” That map roughly corresponds with the creation of the first modern Ukrainian state (the Cossack Hetmanate).Denying the existence of a historical Ukraine does not provide a legal pretext for Moscow’s current military incursion into eastern Ukraine or its 2014 annexation of Crimea.While Zhirinovsky might be correct that the term Ukrainian itself was not in wide use in 1612, that has no bearing on the existence of a Ukrainian people then or on the rights of Ukrainian people today.Polygraph.info, therefore, finds his statement to be misleading.";https://www.kp.ru/daily/26444/3315543/,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40871165?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46507,https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russia-will-overcome-post-crimea-challenges-putin-vows-44906,http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/47878#sel=7:3:jjT,7:19:hjv,http://bunews.com.ua/society/item/opinion-russias-denial-of-ukrainian-identity-lies-at-the-heart-of-librarian-prosecution-in-moscow,https://themoscowtimes.com/news/majority-of-russian-presidential-challengers-pledge-support-for-separatists-in-eastern-ukraine-60791,http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainians.htm;Fiery Russian Nationalist Politico Denies Ukraine History;;;;;;

Regarded as the largest Russian-led military exercise since 1981, some 297,000 service personnel took part in that drill.On October 29, RT’s Murad Gazdiev said that the simulated enemy in the latest NATO drill is “unsurprisingly exactly as powerful as Moscow,” adding both sides have been “going to extremes staging bigger and bigger wargames.”The report cited NATO spokesman Dylan White, who said Vostok demonstrates Russia’s focus on exercises simulating a large-scale conflict, which “fits into a pattern we have seen over some time – a more assertive Russia significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence.”Gazdiev found fault with this claim, saying that “Russia’s military budget has been decreasing, not increasing, year after year,” and noting that Russia’s defense spending has shrunk from $69.2 billion in 2016 to $46 billion in 2018. NATO’s spending during that period, by contrast, grew from $924 billion to $1.103 trillion.He said that in spending terms there is no competition between NATO and Russia, adding it has led to a remarkable cycle, whereby NATO ramps up its fighting machine, “forcing” Moscow to respond with its own buildup “which NATO then calls Russian aggression,” which the alliance then uses “to justify stationing more tanks and more troops near Russia.”Gazdiev’s report concluded with a rhetorical attempt at dismay, asking how much longer the situation can escalate before a spark is put to “this trillion dollar powder keg.” Russia’s ‘Shrinking’ Defense Spending ExplainedOn the surface, the basic point is true: NATO’s defense spending has increased from 2016-18, while Russia’s has declined.But the 2017 cut was the first drop in Russian military spending since 1998.Ultimately, the situation is much more complicated than simply inferring intent from outlays. But first, the reasons behind those cuts warrant consideration.Screen capture from www.globalsecurity.org showing trend in Russian defense spending.As noted by several analysts, Russia’s 2016 defense spending was inflated by “a one-off adjustment” to pay off debt that had accumulated over the years.That year, the Finance Ministry reportedly provided 792 billion rubles (approximately $12.03 billion at today’s exchange rate) to help pay off defense contractors. Another 186 billion rubles ($2.82 billion dollars) was spent to that end in 2017, making outlays for those years appear higher, wrote Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist with the CNA Corporation.Kofman said a tightening in funding controls had also disrupted “the continuity of Russian defense-spending data.” Previously the industry had been allowed to hoard advances for armaments that had not been produced as scheduled.He also noted it was analytically unhelpful to measure Russia’s defense budget in dollars, as “Russia’s defense sector doesn’t buy much of anything in dollars,” resulting in purchasing parity distortions.Another factor concerns the fact that Russian Federal Treasury data only accounts for actual expenditures, not full allocations, wrote Mark Galeotti, a senior non-resident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague.Then there is the issue of transparency. Galeotti says that in Russia, “even more so than in the West,” defense and security expenditures “often appear under different budget lines and obscure headings.” “Pre-conscription physical and skills training is outsourced to schools through the revived GTO (Ready for Labor and Defense) program,” Galeotti wrote. “The cost for this comes out of the education budget, while part of the aid and development budget is likely paying for the mercenaries fighting in Syria.”A picture from ssu.gov.ua, the Security Service of Ukraine, allegedly showing Russian mercenaries operating in Syria.Olga Oliker, a senior adviser and director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), mirrored that point. Oliker said different components of Russia’s defense budget have been classified at different times, making them unavailable for analysis. Russia is also not unique in funding some defense-related items, like portions of its nuclear weapons program or military pensions, through sources other than its defense budget. That, coupled with the fact that civil defense and paramilitary forces are left out of the budgetary equation, further muddies the funding waters. Underlining that point is evidence that Russian mercenaries with opaque funding sources have been linked to what would normally be regular military operations, including sometimes combat, in eastern Ukraine, Syria and the Central African Republic.“This makes year-on-year comparisons a challenge, and comparisons with other countries all the more so,” Oliker said.Then there is the issue of force size and how it relates to the relative cost of living. As noted by Oliker, “maintaining a military force of 500,000 high-quality personnel in a country with lower salaries is obviously cheaper.”UKRAINE -- A boy holds a machine gun at a military hardware exhibition during a swear-in ceremony for new recruits of the Russian military-patriotic club ""Yunarmia"" (Young army) in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Crimea, October 27, 2018.For example, in January it was announced that pay hikes would see a Russian lieutenant now earning 66,100 rubles ($1,006) a month. By contrast, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army earns between $3,496 and $4,839 per month. Higher related outlays will further be seen in military housing, food service medical care and bonuses.Galeotti said that that any windfalls from rising oil prices, for example, always have the potential of resulting in specially-mandated military allocations.Even so, from the high-end estimate of 25.5% to a notional cut of 5%, Russia’s military spending did drop between 2016-17. The question is why.The narrative Russia is presenting -- that defense spending cuts are part of some natural desire for the Kremlin to scale back its military operations just as it is embarking on a 10-year force modernization plan -- appears counterintuitive.Rather, a drop in oil prices, Western sanctions related to Russia’s military actions in Ukraine and related economic woes, are often cited as the main impetus behind the cuts.Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which carried out a study on Russia’s defense cuts, said that in a time of austerity, the military was not the first thing to be cut.""The military budget has been restricted by economic problems that the country has experienced since 2014,"" Wezeman told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, adding that Moscow first implemented infrastructure and education cuts until there was finally no choice but to ""spread the pain.""Screen capture from NATO.int showing IMF figrues on Russian military vs. non-military spending trends.The other question is whether there really is “no comparison” between Russia and NATO because of the budgetary disparity.Leonid Bershidsky has argued that, nuclear parity notwithstanding, Russia is much better at getting more bang for its buck when it comes to projecting military force in the modern era. “Today's wars aren't fought with fat wads of money,” Bershidsky wrote. “The adversaries are mostly small, agile forces that aren't as well-resourced as nation states. Fighting them requires a combination of local knowledge, brute force applied only at important points in a conflict and ability to shift risks onto the shoulders of irregular fighters. Russia kept cutting its defense budget all through its participation in the Syrian war. Yabloko, an opposition party, earlier this year put the cost of the Syrian operation for Russia at about 140.4 billion rubles ($2.4 billion at the current exchange rate) since September, 2015; that's some 4% of what the U.S. allocated to overseas contingency operations in 2017 alone – and the outcome is as good as Russia could have expected.”​Simply put, Russia has proven adept at making due with less.Ultimately, Russia’s de facto annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, its outright annexation of Crimea, its ongoing occupation of Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region and its clandestine war in eastern Ukraine belie the claim that Russia itself is the victim of aggression by its neighbors.Russian military drills on August 3, 2016 in Tiraspol,Transnistria, the breakaway region of Moldova occupied by Russian forces.​So while it’s true that Russia’s military spending has taken a temporary dip, that in itself does not demonstrate a desire for peace with its neighbors.And so we find RT’s report in this case is at best misleading.";http://tass.com/politics/1023984,https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-begins-largest-exercise-since-cold-war/4628492.html,https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_the_truth_about_russias_defence_budget_7255,https://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/collapsing-russian-defense-budget-and-other-fairy-tales,https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_the_truth_about_russias_defence_budget_7255,http:// https://jamestown.org/program/russias-new-competitor-could-ukrainian-pmcs-halt-russian-advance/,https://russiandefpolicy.blog/2018/01/03/kremlin-raising-military-pay/,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-14/russia-s-military-is-leaner-but-meaner;Russian Military Budget Cuts Are No Olive Branch;;;;;;

We are close not only as Muslim brothers, but also as friends. We understand the nature of war and of what is happening in your country, in Palestine.”RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin embraces Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, February 12, 2018.The head of the Palestinian delegation, Talal Naji, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, responded: “We love and are proud of President Vladimir Putin, because he is a friend of Palestine and not only Palestine, but all the people who are seeking freedom. President Putin succeeded in restoring Russia’s authority in the international arena and forced all to respect Russia.”Both of Naji’s assertions – that Putin supports “all people seeking freedom,” and that he has succeeded in restoring Russia’s authority and respect globally -- are false.“Support” for “all people seeking freedom”The Palestinian official praised Putin’s supposed support for freedom-seeking people, in Grozny. The capital of Chechnya, however, was bombed to ruins during two wars between the Russian military and a Chechen insurgency that began as a secessionist movement in 1994 but turned jihadist in the early 2000's, after years of brutal fighting.Ironically, Ramzan Kadyrov’s father, Akhmad Kadyrov, first declared a jihad against the Russian state. This marked a turning point for the insurgency that eventually lead to the emergence of violent radicalism in Chechnya.Though Grozny has been rebuilt, many Chechens say nothing has been forgotten. Anzor Maskhadov, who now lives in exile in Europe after the Russian Special Forces assassinated his father Aslan Maskhadov, who was Chechnya’s first democratically elected president, posted this photograph in Facebook:An American scholar, expert on Russia, the North Caucasus, and the Middle East, Walter Richmond posted the same photograph on Facebook in July comparing the photo of Grozny to recent images from Syria. Russia bombed indiscriminately the city of Aleppo, which according to the U.N., may have constituted a war crime.Russia’s “restored international authority and respect”The following developments have taken place under President Vladimir Putin’s leadership:According to multiple independent sources, Russia’s immediate neighbors see Moscow as unfriendly and posing a security threat rather than an ally or partner.In the “frozen conflicts” zones in Russia’s immediate neighborhood, Moscow has been playing a dubious role, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations.European Council on Foreign Relations, Infographic of Russia's presence in conflict zonesIn Nagorno-Karabakh, while officially serving as a key peacekeeping authority, Russia has sold arms to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.In Georgia, Russia openly supports the two secessionist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, including militarily.Russia maintains a military presence in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, a scenario that is being repeated in eastern Ukraine.Negative views and mistrust towards Russia among its neighbors increased after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, and then masterminded and orchestrated a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.The shooting down of the civilian airliner MH-17 over Ukraine, which international investigators have held the Russian military responsible for, despite Moscow’s denials and falsified evidence, further hurt Russia’s reputation in Europe and elsewhere.Germany -- ""Der Spiegel"" cover, July 28, 2014, showing victims of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 (MH17) with words ""Stop Putin Now!"" in redThe Eurasian Economic Union, a group Russia created as an alternative to the European Union, is falling apart.The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stripped Russia of voting rights.Russia has lost its membership in the G7, an informal global club of industrial nations.In response to Russia’s state-orchestrated use of a military-grade chemical agent against a former Russian military intelligence agent and his daughter in Britain, dozens of countries expelled nearly 70 Russian spies posing as diplomats.Both the EU and the U.S., and a number of other nations, have imposed sanctions against Russia for Moscow’s international actions, including interference in the political processes of other countries.Pew Research Center polls in 2017 showed “Russia’s international image is more negative than positive,” with 34% of respondents viewing Russia “in a positive light overall” and 40% viewing it “negatively.” Of the countries surveyed in the Middle East, where the United Nations has implicated Russia in war crimes in Syria, 93% of Jordanians, 62% of Turks and 61% of Israelis expressed a negative view of Russia, according to Pew. The Pew Research Center found that worldwide, a median of 60% say they lack confidence in Putin’s global leadership.A Russian Su-27 jet is seen in a screenshot from a US Navy video handout flying close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea on January 29, 2018The Council on Foreign Relations' tenth annual Preventive Priorities Survey ranked Russia among its eight “top tier risks” to watch for 2018.According to the World Bank, Russia’s economic growth remains “modest” (1.5% in 2018) despite relatively high oil prices.Russia’s international reputation as a business partner has been tarnished by multiple corruption scandals and state-level criminal activities, including money laundering.In Europe, Russia’s state energy giant Gazprom is the target of an antitrust investigation involving eight EU countries.RUSSIA -- A dog walks on the street in the village of Loyga, northern Russia, October 10, 2018The Freedom House 2018 report ranked Russia as “not free,” calling its political system “authoritarian.”Russia’s 2018 Freedom House ranking for Russia marks a significant drop compared even to years immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The bottom right corner has the logo for RT, the Russian state-owned foreign language TV channel, and the upper left corner identifies the video as having come from the Revolutionary Forces of Syria Media Center, a channel associated with the Syrian opposition.A reverse image search on the Tineye site by Polygraph.info revealed the source of the photo. It is a screengrab from a video posted on the RFS channel on November 22, 2016, titled “The Edge of Death #MannequinChallenge.” The hashtag #MannequinChallenge is associated with a viral internet trend, where people would be frozen in action, standing absolutely still, imitating mannequins, while a video camera moves through the scene. Many of these videos depicted people at work or in action scenes.Tineye reverse image searchAlmost immediately, supporters of the Syrian government began claiming the video was proof that the White Helmets had staged their rescue footage. An article published by RT in November 2016 featured the same image attached to the Russian U.K. Embassy’s October 30 tweet, and claimed that the video raised questions about the authenticity of other videos taken by the White Helmets. The RT article also claimed that the video was removed from the group’s accounts a few hours after it was posted. While the video does not appear on the Syrian Civil Defense’s own video channel, it is still up on the RFS channel and is embedded within the RT article itself. The RT article also acknowledged that the White Helmets openly identified the video with the Mannequin Challenge, and did not claim to be footage of an actual rescue. After coming under criticism for the video, the White Helmets volunteers who did the Mannequin Challenge apologized for doing it, claiming that they were hoping it would bring more attention to the situation in Aleppo, which was under siege by Syrian government forces at the time. Another aspect of the image tweeted by the Russian U.K. Embassy on October 30 is the easy-to-miss disclaimer in the bottom left-hand corner, which reads “Image used for illustration purposes only.” This disclaimer often appears on images tweeted by the Russian U.K. Embassy, although in this case it is small and difficult to read, especially if the reader doesn’t click on the photo to enlarge it. As it is, it a reader could easily interpret the photo to be evidence that the White Helmets stage attacks, as the Russian Ministry claims. With this tweet, the Russian U.K. embassy Twitter feed joins earlier similar disinformation narratives by Russian diplomats involving the White Helmets. On August 27, the Russian Embassy in the Republic of South Africa tweeted a claim that the White Helmets were filming a staged chemical attack (no chemical attack or video of an alleged attack surfaced). The tweet featured an image of what appeared to be a White Helmet volunteer on a film set. The photo was quickly identified as a shot from the movie Revolution Man, a Syrian government propaganda film about a man who stages fake government attacks - exactly the claim the Russian and Syrian governments have been making for years. In April, Russian state TV claimed to have proof that the White Helmets had faked the footage from a chemical attack in Douma that month. For proof, the news report showed still photos of a film crew. However, these were identified as behind-the-scenes photos from the production of a short film about the war in Syria. That film, and the photos shown by Russian state TV, dated to 2016.In conclusion, we find the Russian U.K. Embassy tweet to be misleading, and part of official Russia’s ongoing narrative, without presenting evidence, to have detailed knowledge of plans to film fake chemical attacks. At the same time, Russian officials and state media have repeatedly spread fake or misleading photos in an attempt to support these claims.;http://tass.com/politics/1028402,http://tass.com/world/1022688,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoo02Uw2QWUQWABoQqhCZMw/videos,https://rfsmediaoffice.com/en/about-us/,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/style/mannequin-challenge-is-the-new-viral-video-sensation-you-probably-cant-avoid.html,https://www.rt.com/op-ed/367957-white-helmets-mannequin-challenge/,https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/24/middleeast/mannequin-challenge-white-helmets-syria/index.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-embassy-tweets-misleading-photo-about-syria-/29458058.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-this-proof-white-helmets-staged-chemical-attack/,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-tv-lies-about-syrian-chemical-attack/29192058.html,http://www.globaltimes.cn/galleries/384.html;Russian Embassy Tweets Misleading Photo of White Helmets in Syria;;;;;;
351;;;;False;Andrey Rudenko;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-ukraine-war-osce-statement-russian-involvement/6741972.html;OSCE Interview Fuels Kremlin Disinformation;2018-10-30;polygraph;William Echols;"On October 26, Alexander Hug, deputy head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s monitoring mission in Ukraine, described in a Foreign Policy magazine interview the “challenges and frustration” of monitoring “Europe’s forgotten war.”In comments that have since been amended, Hug reportedly said that the OSCE had not seen direct evidence of Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine.Russian media quickly reacted to the initial interview. Russia-24 state television posted a report on YouTube headlined “BREAKING! OSCE Finally Speaks Up: No Russian Military Presence in Donbass; Kiev Lied!” In it, Correspondent Andrey Rudenko played up Hug’s statement, using it to back the Kremlin’s well-established narrative about eastern Ukraine.“Alexander Hug is well informed. For four years he’s been working in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and in Ukraine as the head [SIC] of the OSCE mission. They basically have open access to any place in the country. I’m not sure about western Ukraine, but here they have free access. They are fully informed. The statement he voiced today is confirmation of what we’ve been broadcasting from here for four years. The armed people here are the locals.”Rudenko noted the presence of volunteers from Russia, Belarus, Italy, Poland and the U.S. in eastern Ukraine – who, he said, account for 10% of the fighters, although those countries are not themselves viewed as parties to the conflict.“But Kyiv naturally began screaming that it had been betrayed. The OSCE destroyed the fairytale that Ukrainian television has been broadcasting,” Rudenko said.On October 27, Hug told the Ukraine Crisis Media Center in an interview that the text published by Foreign Policy of his interview “was misleading and did not reflect his opinion.”“As you know, we do not conclude on the facts we establish and we do not provide evidence. Estimates, facts speak for themselves,” Hug said.When pressed on his original comments regarding whether or not he had seen evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Hug reiterated that the monitoring mission does not draw conclusions from the evidence it gathers.A Correction to the Original Report Foreign Policy has since offered the following correction and clarification:“Correction, October 25, 2018: Alexander Hug is the deputy head of the OSCE’s observer mission in Ukraine. An earlier version described him as the head. Clarification, October 25, 2018: In an earlier version, Hug stated that OSCE had not seen direct evidence of Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine. We have removed this remark, as it did not convey his intended view. He goes on to cite facts and observations that his monitors have recorded.”Alexander Hug, deputy head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s monitoring mission in UkraineIn the most up-to-date version of the Foreign Policy article, Hug stated regarding the situation in eastern Ukraine:“If the question is what we have seen on the ground … we have seen convoys leaving and entering Ukraine on dirt roads in the middle of the night, in areas where there is no official crossing. In one border area, we’ve also made this public, including some footage we have put out. We have seen specific types of weapons that we have described in detail, including electronic warfare equipment. We have spoken to prisoners taken by the Ukrainian forces who claim to be members of the Russian armed forces fighting on rotation in Ukraine. We have seen men with the insignia of the Russian Federation, but you can buy this jacket anywhere. We have also seen the insignia of Germany, Spain, and others—but also of the Russians.”OSCE members for its Special Monitoring Mission stand around a UAV employed in Ukraine.In any case, Russia has long denied its role in fomenting the current war in eastern Ukraine. Responding to a U.S. State Department statement condemning provocations against international monitors in Ukraine, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last year:""We can only - for the hundredth time - repeat that Russia is in no shape or form a party of the conflict” in Ukraine, he said. As Polygraph.info noted at the time, there is abundant verifiable evidence of the presence of Russian military hardware, troops, intelligence agents, and economic aid from Russia in the conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region.Russian President Vladimir Putin himself once admitted to having some military personnel in the Donbas.On October 27, the OSCE reported an SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) had “spotted a surface-to-air missile system (9K33 Osa) and a fuel truck east of Nyzhnokrynske (non-government-controlled, 66km east of Donetsk).”Ukraine, OSCE SMM spotted convoys of trucks entering and exiting Ukraine in Donetsk regionThat UAV, which experienced signal interference that the monitoring mission “assessed as jamming,” is “now considered lost,” the OSCE said.In August, the OSCE posted UAV footage showing a convoy of trucks entering and exiting Ukraine (via Russia) in the middle of the night on a dirt track where there are no border crossing facilities.As previously reported by Polygraph.info, Russia has failed to come up with a verifiable explanation as to where the “separatists” continue obtaining advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them. These include T-90A main battle tanks, which the Ukrainian armed forces have neither purchased nor produced.As early as August 2014, NATO released satellite imagery which it said showed “that Russian combat soldiers, equipped with sophisticated heavy weaponry, are operating inside Ukraine’s sovereign territory.”The following year, VICE News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky tracked one Russian soldier via social media in a groundbreaking report that proved Russian military involvement in Ukraine.So, regardless of the initial comment by Hug to Foreign Policy, there is plenty of verifiable evidence that shows Russia’s direct, if covert, involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, And so, we judge Russia-24’s assertion denying Russia’ presence in Ukraine’s Donbas region to be false.";https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/25/counting-the-dead-in-europes-forgotten-war-ukraine-conflict-donbass-osce/,https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/25/counting-the-dead-in-europes-forgotten-war-ukraine-conflict-donbass-osce/,https://ria.ru/world/20170227/1488833370.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-ukraine-military-presence-kremlin/28340880.html,https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/401342,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-ukraine-russia-donbas/28912097.html,https://www.channel4.com/news/ukraine-russia-nato-satellite-image-soldiers-territory;OSCE Interview Fuels Kremlin Disinformation;;;;;;

It is the most-watched television program in Russia and the former Soviet countries.On Saturday, October 26, much of the program’s airtime was dedicated to the United States, as is usually the case with Vremya.Kleimyonov first informed his viewers of the “mail bomb” incident, suggesting that if one party in the U.S. is “totally eliminated” only one political party will remain. “We already have a name and a mascot for it,” Kleimyonov said, pointing to the screen behind him, where there was a doctored picture with “United America” written over the two symbols of the main U.S. political parties, the donkey and the elephant, photo-shopped as one monstrous hybrid.Screengrab from ""Vremya"" the Russian state TV Channel One with a ""new logo"" for the U.S. political party. 10/26/2018“Don’t get it wrong, it’s not a donkey suffering from constipation. It's a donkelephant, or whatever the American people decide to call it in a free democratic vote without any of our interference,” Kleimyonov said before switching to the next topic – also concerning the United States.“It’s just been announced that Megyn Kelly’s program, our favorite American TV anchor, is being taken off the air,” he said. The NBC action followed an outcry over Kelly’s racially insensitive comments on her program. After speculating about the insignificance of the race issue, he proposed a “healing recipe” for Kelly.“Dear, dear Megyn, spit on your bosses, just spit and come to us, to Russia, to the hero-city of Moscow,” Kleimyonov proposed, looking at an image of Megyn Kelly doctored into the studio interior sitting next to him.Addressing the American journalist, Kleimyonov used the informal “ty” for “you,” which in Russia, is used only with friends and family, instead of the formal “vy.” The choice between “ty” and “vy” is also a way of showing people their position compared to yours – younger or less important.Kleimyonov suggested that Kelly co-host his program, promising her “the love of millions of our men and the envy of millions of women.”“Extinguishing a star”The offer was followed with a report headlined “Extinguishing a star,” in which Channel One’s correspondent in the U.S., Zhanna Agalakova, commented on Megyn Kelly and the race issue in the U.S.“Smart and beautiful, she now is an outcast and a white crow – or, as Americans say a black sheep,” Agalakova said at the start of her report.After a brief review of the scandal that cost Kelly her job with NBC, Agalakova then switched to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Kelly interviewed in 2017. Archived video footage showed Kelly speaking with Agalakova about Putin, with Kelly stating: “I think he likes to be challenged. He is a very smart man. I couldn’t ask him any questions to which he did not know the answers.” That was followed by footage of the Russian president and Kelly chatting and smiling at each other.The footage was seemingly structured in way designed to convince Russians that “the true reason” behind NBC’s decision to terminate a contract with Kelly was, as Vremya host Kleimyonov put it, “our love for her.”That claim is false: NBC said the anchor would no longer host the “Megyn Kelly Today” after she made racially insensitive comments during the October 25 edition of her show. Kelly is widely quoted as questioning, with a panel, what actions would be considered racist: ""Truly, you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for Halloween, or a black person who put on whiteface for Halloween. When I was a kid, it was OK as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character,” Kelly is quoted as saying on October 23.While Kelly's remarks caused outrage, neither her critics nor NBC mentioned her stance toward Russia. Kelly has since apologized for the racially-tinged comments.Vremya is Russia’s flagship news show.

Putin also returned to a perennially contentious topic: the status of Crimea. “Crimea is ours,” Putin said. ”And why ours? Not because we came and grabbed something.” He stated that people in Crimea voted for a referendum that resulted in the peninsula becoming a part of the Russian Federation - - the “will of the people,” he said.Putin further said Russia didn’t need to take anything as “we have an enormous territory, and we don’t need anything from anyone.” He added: “Of course, we value our sovereignty, our independence. It’s always been that way, for the entire history of our state. That’s in the blood of our people, as I’ve repeatedly said.”Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a session of the annual Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, Russia October 18, 2018. Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERSIn an article on Putin’s comments on Crimea, Russia’s TASS state news agency cited the results of the March 16, 2014 “referendum,” in which 96.77% of Crimeans and 95.6% of Sevastopol voters chose to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.”But Putin’s claims that Crimea was not “snatched,” and that Russia does doesn’t need to take territory from anyone have repeatedly been proven false. As Polygraph.info previously reported, the Russian takeover of Crimea in February 2014 began when Russian special forces, operating without national insignia, seized the Crimea parliament building and raised the Russian flag. The bloodless invasion by “little green men” resulted in unmarked Russian soldiers taking control of the Republic.Igor “Strelkov” Girkin, a leading “self-defense” commander in Crimea and later commander of separatist forces in eastern Ukrainian, admitted in a 2015 interview that members of the Crimean parliament were herded into a chamber at gunpoint and forced to support the annexation. The referendum, hastily carried out under military occupation, did not allow for public debate or for political leaders from greater Ukraine to visit the Crimean peninsula. And, in accordance with Ukraine’s constitution, all Ukraine’s citizens should have been given a vote on Crimea’s succession, not only residents of the peninsula.Further undermining the referendum’s validity were the two options on the ballot, each of which made it impossible for Crimea to maintain the status quo. As reported by Reuters at the time, those options were:“Are you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a part of the Russian Federation?”“Are you in favor of restoring the 1992 Constitution and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?”The second option, while on the surface different, entailed “giving Crimea all the qualities of an independent entity within Ukraine – but with the broad right to determine its own path and choose relations with whom it wants – including Russia.”UKRAINE – Russian soldiers march outside an Ukrainian military base in Perevalne, Crimea, March 20, 2014But even with parliamentarians voting at gunpoint and the public being presented with a referendum shortly after being invaded, the putative results -- with 96.77% voting “yes” in Crimea and 95.6% voting “yes” in Sevastopol -- have been called into question.TSN.ua, a Ukrainian news site, reported in May 2014 that Putin’s own Human Rights Council accidently posted (reportedly before taking down) the actual referendum results, which allegedly showed that only 30 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in the referendum. Only half of those – 15 percent of eligible voters – voted for annexation.That report cannot be independently verified.But, as Paul Gregory reported in Forbes, a Human Rights Council report that is still accessible online, entitled “Problems of Crimean Residents,” stated: “In Crimea, according to various indicators, 50-60% voted for unification with Russia with a voter turnout (yavka) of 30-50%.” As Gregory noted: “This leads to a range of between 15 percent (50% x 30%) and 30 percent (60% x 50%) voting for annexation. The turnout in the Crimean district of Sevastopol, according to the Council, was higher: 50-80%.”UKRAINE – Participants hold placards and shout slogans during an anti-war rally in the Crimean village of Eskisaray, outside Simferopol, March 10, 2014​So even the overinflated turnout figures have been contradicted by one of Putin’s own consultative bodies.In any case, On March 27, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, stating that the referendum, “having no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.” The resolution urged all countries “not to recognize any alteration of the status” of Crimea.As for Putin’s claim that Russia was an enormous country that didn’t need to take territory from others? Following the de facto secession of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the wake of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the German broadcaster ARD asked Putin if Crimea was the next “target” for Russian aggression.GEORGIA -- Georgian refugees are seen walking past a Russian armoured vehicle in the village of Igoeti, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Tbilisi, August 16, 2008“The Crimea is not a disputed territory. There is no ethnic conflict there in contrast to the conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia,” Putin replied angrily, demonstrating at the time his own recognition of internationally accepted borders. “Russia recognized the current borders of today’s Ukraine a long time ago … The question of ‘targets’ for Russia only serve as provocation,” he added.Then, as now, Putin’s statements have proven to be false.;https://www.rt.com/news/441631-putin-nuclear-holocaust-heaven/,https://www.rt.com/news/441637-putin-kerch-massacre-globalization/,http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/58848,http://https://ria.ru/politics/20181018/1530978627.html,http://tass.com/politics/1026722,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russian-crimea-land-grab/29496991.html,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/12/crimea-vote-join-russia-ballot-no-option_n_4947557.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2014/05/05/putins-human-rights-council-accidentally-posts-real-crimean-election-results-only-15-voted-for-annexation/#62391357f172,http://president-sovet.ru/members/blogs/bobrov_e_a/problemy-zhiteley-kryma-/;Putin Repeats Old False Claim that Crimea ‘is Ours’;;;;;;

Stahl pressed Trump on why, “publicly,” he never has “a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.”Trump countered, saying that unlike his predecessor, he “gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers” to help counter the Moscow-backed war in the country’s east.Stahl then asked if Putin is involved in “assassinations” or “poisonings.”Trump replied: “Probably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I don't--”When Stahl pressed him on the use of the word “probably,” Trump added: “But I rely on them (the Russians), it's not in our country.” On Monday, September 16, Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov responded to the Trump interview, telling reporters the Kremlin is confident no “well-grounded accusations” can be leveled at President Vladimir Putin in relation to his alleged involvement in the poisoning of the Skripals, the state news agency TASS reported, referring to the March poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.""US President [Donald Trump] did not come up with any direct accusations [against Putin in the “60 Minutes” interview],"" Peskov said. ""Moreover, there can be no substantiated accusations against the Russian president.""While it is true that Trump leveled no direct accusations against Putin, he also conceded it was likely Russia had carried out such attacks. In any case, Trump’s words have no bearing on what accusations can or cannot be leveled at Putin in this context, since the British government made the case against Russia in the poisonings, and President Trump is on the record expressing “full confidence” in the British conclusions.The Case Against RussiaPutin has expressed disdain for Sergei Skripal, the former Russian military intelligence officer who, along with his daughter, Yulia, was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok on March 4, 2018 in Salisbury, England. While the Skripals ultimately survived, Dawn Sturgess, a woman who later came across a fake perfume bottle that the British say was used to deliver the Novichok, died in July.Retired colonel Sergei Skripal is pictured in the Moscow District Court when he was convicted of spying for Britain.Earlier this month, Putin called Skripal “a traitor to his homeland” and “scum,” adding that the poisoning scandal had been “artificially inflated.”Putin, himself a former KGB officer, has long expressed acrimony towards double agents, saying in 2010 that traitors would “choke on their 30 pieces of silver.”Russia has dismissed revelations that the two suspects, whom the open-source investigative website Bellingcat identified as military intelligence officers Anatoly Chepiga and Aleksandr Mishkin, were behind the attack on the Skripals. But the evidence pointing towards Russian state actors' involvement is quite strong.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed that the substance smeared on the front door of the Skripals’ home is the Russian-developed nerve agent, Novichok. One week after Britain announced there was sufficient evidence to charge Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, aliases used to carry out the attack, Putin called on the men to ""appear before the media to tell their story.""Shortly thereafter, an interview aired with RT head Margarita Simonyan, in which the suspects claimed they had visited Salisbury to see the city’s cathedral. RUSSIA -- RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan shows an image of two men during an interview with Aleksandr Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are suspected by the British authorities of poisoning former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.But CCTV footage showed the two Russian agents in the area of the Skripals’ home on the day of the attack, located one mile in the opposite direction of the cathedral, which they never visited. The suspects left for Moscow the evening of the attack.British officials say traces of Novichok were later found in the suspect’s London hotel room.A report last week from Czech Radio (CR), which cited an unnamed Czech intelligence source, said the suspects had visited Prague in 2014, allegedly while Skripal was there.According to Neovlivni.cz, when Skripal visited Prague in 2012, the Czech Republic expelled five Russian diplomats “for security reasons.” Following his 2014 visit, three more diplomats were sent home, CR cited the news portal as saying, though CR reports it is not clear whether it was Skripal who exposed the agents.""It looks like the Russians had a group of people that followed Skripal long before the attempt to assassinate him,"" CR quoted one source as saying, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.British Prime Minister Theresa May said that lacking a credible response from the Russian government, the Skripal poisoning amounted to “an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom.”May stated: “Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down; our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so; Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations; the Government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal.”A joint statement on the attack, signed by British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, read: “We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU, and that this operation was almost certainly approved at a senior government level.”So the full record establishes that Peskov’s claim that no substantiated accusations can be leveled at Putin is false.";https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-interview-60-minutes-full-transcript-lesley-stahl-jamal-khashoggi-james-mattis-brett-kavanaugh-vladimir-putin-2018-10-14/,http://tass.com/politics/1025985,https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-skripal-scum-traitor-media/29523987.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-denies-evidence-in-salisbury-poisoning/29513455.html,https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/skripal-suspects-believed-to-have-followed-him-in-czechia-long-before-attempted-poisoning,https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-novichok-suspects-shadowed-skripal-in-prague-report-says/29536293.html;Trump Comments Provide No Grist for Russian Disinformation Mill;;;;;;

Polls Disagree;2018-09-24;polygraph;William Echols;The Second Eurasian Women’s Forum held in St. Petersburg last week reportedly brought together 2,000 politicians, entrepreneurs, scientists and public figures from 110 countries to discuss a raft of political and economic issues.According to organizers, “the highlight of the event” was the plenary session titled “Women for Global Security and Sustainable Development,” featuring an address by Russian President Vladimir Putin.But for Russian state media, an event dedicated to the empowerment of women was seized on as an opportunity to lavish praise on the Russian president.One video, published by Russian Insider under the title “Women Went Crazy Around Putin! Russian President Was A Superstar At Eurasian Women’s Forum,” insinuated that the Russian president was the reason the women had gotten “dolled up” for the event. While footage from that report shows attendees giving Putin a cordial welcome, Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of RT, told Russia-1's “Evening With Vladimir Solovyov” that the Russian president received a reception more befitting of a “rock star,” claiming that a “serious international audience” of women were “rushing in a last ditch effort to meet him like schoolchildren at a Beatles’ concert.”But when Solovyov pitched a seemingly pre-prepared question -- “Why do women from different countries, not all (of whom) treat Russia unequivocally well, why do they react like this to Putin?” – Simonyan responded with a false claim.“I’m always arguing with my acquaintances and friends working in the so-called or not so-called opposition media … who love to repeat the phrase: ‘the whole world is against us’…,” Simonyan said. “I always want to point out to my friends: ‘And what, China isn’t the world, India isn’t the world, the Arab world, almost all of which is completely on our side, well a significant part of it, isn’t the world? Latin America isn’t the world? People don’t notice their own snobbism and their well, what borders on xenophobia. They don’t respect other nations, because for those people, the world is the Western world, and not just people from the so-called Western world, but the Western establishment…”Simonyan went on to state that the largest part of the world in terms of population shares Russia’s annoyance with the “hypocrisy emanating from the West,” adding that even Nino Burjanadze, former chairperson of Georgia’s parliament, reacted very positively despite the fact that Georgia is the only country with which Russia “has officially gone to war.” She added that American representatives were also in attendance.But what about the claim that disdain for Russian policy in general and Putin in particular is strictly a manifestation of the Western establishment?According to 2017 poll results released by Pew Research Center, “Russia’s international image is more negative than positive,” with 34% of respondents viewing Russia “in a positive light overall,” and 40% viewing it “negatively.”According to 2017 poll results released by Pew Research Center, “Russia’s international image is more negative than positive.”Decidedly mixed opinions were found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.Of the countries surveyed in the Middle East, where the United Nations has implicated Russia in war crimes in Syria, 93% of Jordanians, 62% of Turks and 61% of Israelis expressed a negative view of Russia, according to Pew. The Lebanese were relatively split, with 48% expressing negative sentiment vs. 47% positive, while Tunisians were also narrowly divided at 37% negative vs. 39% positive.But Simonyan was correct that Indians do generally hold a favorable view of Russia, with 47% expressing a favorable view and only 13% indicating an unfavorable one.Data for China was unavailable, but a plurality of South Koreans (41%) and a majority of Japanese (61%) hold an unfavorable opinion of Russia. By contrast, 83% of Vietnamese and 53% of Filipinos have a positive view of Russia.In Latin America, a slim plurality of Brazilians (36%) expressed a negative view of Russia (vs. 35% positive). Argentinians were split at 27% each, while a slim plurality of Columbians (32%) expressed a positive attitude toward Russia (vs. 31% negative). Other countries where pluralities expressed positive sentiment were Mexico (32%), Peru (41%) and Venezuela (38%).A plurality of South Africans and Kenyans expressed a negative view of Russia (40% and 29%, respectively), while a plurality of respondents in Ghana (33%), Nigeria (45%), Senegal (34%) and Tanzania (45%) maintained a positive attitude towards Russia.Regarding the Russian president, the center reported that worldwide, a median of 60% say they lack confidence in Putin’s global leadership.RUSSIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a session of the Eurasian Women's Forum in St. Petersburg, September 20, 2018​A 2017 survey by the Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association (WIN/GIA) did find the Russian president had gained ground, moving from a 33% favorability rating in 2015 to 43% in 2017 (with 40% that year holding an unfavorable opinion). But that plurality of support falls far short of a global embrace.In January, Gallup International released its 41st Annual End of Year Survey. While that survey did find that Putin is globally more popular than U.S. President Donald Trump, majorities from India, Iraq, South Africa and nearly two dozen other countries “reject both Trump and Putin.” 2017 survey by the Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association (WIN/GIA)As noted by Gallup International Association (GIA) Vice President Andrey Milekhin: “The choice between these two Presidents is not an easy one and at the end the candidate ‘against both’ won.”As for Georgia, Simonyan’s account of Burjanadze’s warmth towards Putin doesn’t erase the fact that 75% of Georgians have an unfavorable or very unfavorable attitude toward the Russian president, according to the results of a GORBI survey released this month. So while global opinion on Putin and Russia is clearly mixed, claims that opposition to the Kremlin is the sole purview of the Western establishment are patently false.;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/13/key-public-opinion-findings-on-trump-putin-and-the-countries-they-lead/,http://gallup-international.bg/en/Publications/2018/411-Gallup-International%E2%80%99s-41-Annual-Global-End-of-Year-Survey-PUTIN-LEADS-GLOBALLY-OVER-TRUMP-AS-A-CHOICE-FOR-COUNTRY-LEADER,-NEW-CONSTELLATIONS-OF-NATIONS-ARE-EMERGING,https://www.finchannel.com/opinion/75769-after-7-years-putin-s-favorability-ratings-drop-among-georgian-citizens;RT Chief: The World Loves Vladimir Putin.

No clinical trials have ever been held at the Lugar Center. The medications used in Georgia to treat and cure hepatitis C have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, as well as the European Medicines Agency, for the treatment of hepatitis C infection in humans, and they do not need any additional testing. These certificates of approval are recognized by markets both in Georgia and around the world. The role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the Lugar Center is to provide technical assistance in the areas of public health laboratory capacity building and quality assurance. The CDC’s role within the Hepatitis C Elimination Program in Georgia is to provide technical support to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs for data analysis to monitor progress towards HCV Elimination,"" Christopher A. Davenport, Press and Information Attaché at the U.S. Embassy Tbilisi wrote to Polygraph.info via email. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nor the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) conduct any of the testing or analysis for the hepatitis C program. That work is conducted solely by the NCDC.Over the last few years, Georgia’s Central Public Health Reference Laboratory -- the so-called “Lugar Lab” – has repeatedly been attacked by some Moscow insiders and politicians. The attacks usually begin a bombshell “revelation” that is instantly picked up by the Kremlin-controlled media, which report an “outbreak of pandemic diseases” or “leakage of pathogens.” Polygraph.info debunked such claims last October.The latest such “revelation” came during a September 11 press briefing by former Georgian state security minister Igor Giorgadze, who claimed that the Lugar Lab performed secret experiments on humans.“A preliminary examination of only a portion of the documents – and there are … thousands of pages delivered to me from my friends in Georgia – shows that behinds the walls of the Lugar Laboratory, biologists of the U.S. military-medical group in Georgia and private contractors under federal contract with the … Defense Threat Reduction Agency indeed could have performed on secret experiments on residents of Georgia,” Giorgadze told Russian media during the briefing in Moscow.A top Georgian official told Polygraph.info that the information disseminated by the Russian media is a stupid rumor and that no experiments on humans are performed at the Lugar Lab. In his opinion, this is an attempt to discredit Georgia’s successful program to eradicate hepatitis C.Georgia -- Amiran Gamkrelidze, Head of National Center for Disease Control and Public Health. Tbilisi, 01Nov 2016The documents revealed by Giorgadze and posted online under the heading “Experiments on People,” show medical logs of treatment of patients suffering from advance stages of the hepatitis C virus. According to the logs, 73 people died after receiving treatment over the course of nine months in 2015-2016.According to the U.S. National Institute for Health, hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver characterized by jaundice, liver enlargement, abdominal and gastric discomfort, abnormal liver function, and other symptoms, leading to the liver failure.NIH says hepatitis has numerous causes, including excessive alcohol consumption, infection by certain bacteria, and viruses contracted through drug abuse (needle sharing).“Since May 2015, an unprecedented program is being implemented in Georgia for the elimination of hepatitis C. It involves screening the adult population of the country and includes treating patients with an active infection with modern antiviral medicines such as Sofosbuvir, and a combination of Sofosbuvir and Ledipasvir,” said Amiran Gamkrelidze, the director general of Georgia’s National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC).He added that the project is a shining example of collaboration between the public, private and international sectors, and that Russia “wants to discredit it” due to the involvement of U.S. foundations and institutions.Georgia -- Georgian Government Meeting. Prime Minister’s Statement on Hepatitis C Program. Tbilisi, 15Jan2015The anti-hepatitis C program Georgia is a joint project of the Georgian government, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American pharmaceutical company Gilead. The implementation of the project is monitored by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), consisting of leading international scientists and public health specialists, according to Gamkrelidze.As part of an attempt to discredit the anti-hepatitis C effort, Moscow has charged that the Lugar Lab, one of many Georgian institutions involved in this program, is a secret U.S. military facility that is developing biological weapons FOR USE against the local population in Georgia and against Russia’s national interests.In fact, this medical and research center is actually working to improve Georgian people’s health.“The Lugar Center is a high-level lab diagnostic facility for various infectious diseases, which also includes the hepatitis C diagnostics, and serves as an external control and referral lab for other labs throughout the country that are involved in eradicating the virus,” Gamkrelidze said. “Consequently, the Lugar Center has nothing to do with treating people, as was voiced in Giorgadze’s briefing and in the presented documentation. There are currently 32 medical facilities throughout the country that provide treatment for hepatitis C.”In its section on alcohol and hepatitis C, NIH relates that while with many patients a diseased liver is able to regenerate its tissue and retain its function, severe hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver tissue and to such conditions as fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer and chronic liver dysfunction.If treated late, such conditions are usually fatal.Gamkrelidze confirmed that in the first stage of the program in Georgia (2015– first half of 2016), treatment was provided to patients with a high degree of liver damage. “Regardless of decompensated cirrhosis, severe fibrosis, ascites and other complications, the patients were given the opportunity of treatment within the program to be able to defeat the virus. Since July 2016, all limitations on a patient’s condition have been canceled, due to which all patients have the opportunity to receive treatment.”NCDC found that while most of the treated patients were cured, a number of patients died during the implementation of the program. “This was associated with various degrees of liver damage and various complications and concomitant diseases that are quite common in patients with severe hepatitis C. It is notable that from the very beginning of the program, the rate of patients who died due to various reasons has nothing to do with the medicines used,” Gamkrelidze explained.As Giorgadze’s documentation shows, 73 people died while in the treatment program during nine months in 2015- 2016. It shows that the Lugar Center treated them with Sovaldi and Ribavarin, which are U.S. and EU approved oral medications used for treatment of chronic hepatitis C.This is confirmed by the published materials. For example, all the cases under the column headed “reason for taking” (these medications) listed ”chronic hepatitis C.”In April 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved use of Sovaldi for pediatric patients, meaning children aged 12 to 17. The FDA previously approved this medication to treat hepatitis C in adults.The FDA’s medication guide also approves Ribavirin, which is sold under different brand names, including Copegus and Rebetol.Georgia -- Medications for the treatment of hepatitis C. Tbilisi. 21Apr2015Ribavirin and Sovaldi are also approved by the European Medicines Agency.Worldwide, around 400,000 persons die from liver diseases related to hepatitis C annually. Georgia, a country with a population of 3.7 million, has long been affected by hepatitis C and, thanks to the efforts made in the last ten years, the country is on the forefront of the fight against this disease.The prevalence of hepatitis C is blamed for the collapse of the country’s health system in the 1990s.The low quality of health services, unsafe drug injection practices (including the widespread practice of needle sharing among people who inject drugs) and low infection control and blood safety in health facilities continued into 2000s.All these factors contributed to the spread of hepatitis C in the general population.In 2015, the World Health Organization admitted that significant challenges in the fight against hepatitis C remain, including the asymptomatic, chronic nature of the virus, which has resulted in delayed diagnosis and transmission among hard-to-reach regions. To address these challenges, the Georgian government adopted a long-term strategy for 2016–2020 aimed at the total elimination of the disease in the country.According to the national population survey conducted by the NCDC and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during May-August, 2015, 5.4 percent of Georgia’s 3.7 million population -- 150,300 adults -- have been hepatitis C positive. The successful implementation of the program in Georgia resulted in 24,481 out of 36,012 patients getting rid of the infection in 2015-2017.The so-called Lugar Lab, officially called the Center for Public Health Research, is located in Tbilisi and named after former U.S. Senator Richard Lugar. It became operational in 2013. The Center is part of Georgia’s National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) system, within the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded the Center under the 1991 Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which was designed to dismantle Cold War-era weapons of mass destruction and convert such capabilities to exclusively peaceful scientific research.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/is-a-secret-us-lab-in-georgia-spreading-deadly-pathogens/28825452.html,http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2072611/,https://ge2018.wordpress.com/,https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-4/245-254.htm,https://ge2018.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/%d1%8d%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%8b-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bb%d1%8e%d0%b4%d1%8f%d1%85/,https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm551407.htm,https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm551407.htm,http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002798/human_med_001723.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124,http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/pages/news/news/2017/08/georgias-hepatitis-c-elimination-programme-setting-an-example-in-europe,http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/pages/news/news/2017/08/georgias-hepatitis-c-elimination-programme-setting-an-example-in-europe,http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB447/,http://ndupress.ndu.edu/portals/68/documents/casestudies/cswmd_casestudy-3.pdf;Updated: Georgia’s “Secret Lab” – Experiments on Humans or Normal Treatment of Hepatitis C?;;;;;;

Authorities say the two suspects used Novichok, the Russian-made military grade nerve agent, to poison Skripal and daughter, both of whom survived.Metropolitan Police statement -- Novichok -- Two suspects in connection with Salisbury attack - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov (undated)Neil Basu, the head of Brtain’s counter-terrorism police, said the attack was a “remarkably sophisticated” assassination attempt. Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament the government had concluded the two suspects were officers in Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU. British Prime Minister Theresa May addresses Parliament, saying the Novichok poisoning was a Russian intelligence operation.“The GRU is a highly disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command, so this was not a rogue operation,” May said. “It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state.” The Russian authorities, including the Foreign Ministry, top lawmakers and the state-controlled media, responded to the British announcement using the classic Soviet military strategy of maskirovka, a doctrine of deception that includes such measures as concealment, imitation using decoys and dummies, maneuvers of deception, denial, and disinformation.  Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma, the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament, dismissed the British investigation as an “anti-Russian provocation.” ”Britain is continuing its massive anti-Russian provocation. In the Skripals’ case, people have been officially indicted whose names do not tell [us] anything yet. It is announced that they are officers of the GRU. That is an absolute drivel,” Slutsky said. MOSCOW -- Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the Russian State Duma's International Affairs Committee, Sergei Fadeichev/TASS, March 21, 2018.The Life.ru website, known for its ties Russia’s FSB intelligence service, mocked the investigation, the British people and their prime minister with a piece headlined “Are you crazy, May?”However, it was Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova who used the art of maskirovka with greatest mastery.Zakharova expressed outrage over the British refusal to release information critical for the investigation. That is, in fact, the opposite of what the British authorities did: they have released all the information Moscow would need to identify the two suspects. The Russian authorities could run the photos of the two suspects through their massive facial recognition database, or check the data base of Zakharova’s Foreign Ministry for travel passports that have been issue. There are other details that provide Russia with information to identify the two men.U.K. -- Metropolitan Police statement -- Novichok – the suspects Aleksander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov passing through passport control at London Heathrow at 7:28 p.m. on March 4, 2018.The British police report includes data on the date, time and point of the two suspects’ exit from Russia. It also reveals the number of the commercial flight they took to Britain.“At 3 pm on Friday, 2 March, the suspects arrived at Gatwick airport, having flown from Moscow on Aeroflot flight SU2588,” the British counterterrorism police report states. Aeroflot flight SU2588 is a regular daily direct flight from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport to Gatwick, London. Russia -- A view of a terminal of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport.Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, Russia’s largest airport, is, according to its official Web page, “equipped with the latest security systems: entrances and checkpoints have metal detectors and X-rays, microwave scanners, and advanced gas sensors. We have introduced a multi-level system for automatic 100% baggage inspection and analytical video surveillance that can detect potentially hazardous objects according to set parameters.”. Besides an airport security check, every passenger traveling abroad must pass through customs control, which includes checking passengers’ travel documents, interviewing them and searching both their belongings and person. Passengers must first pass through flight registration before going through customs control. Thus, to obtain the information Zakharova says the British authorities are refusing to share, all Russian authorities need to do is check the passenger manifest for Aeroflot flight SU2588 on March 2, 2018. Britain -- Metropolitan Police statement -- Novichok – a small glass bottle labeled Nina Ricci Premier Jour with a modified nozzle contained a significant amount of Novichok, found at rubbish bag in a private home.In the months after the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter Yulia, Polygraph.info debunked more than 40 different claims made by Moscow, all questioning whether the crime actually took place designed to cause confusion about and foster distrust in the official agencies and the information they provide to the public.

We have also removed from the story reference to Russian violations dating back to 2004 and we will seek clarification from U.S. and independent authorities. We do not change this verdict. Please see the editor’s note below.The U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump moved to suspend funding for the Open Skies Treaty on August 13 after the U.S. accused Russia of not complying with the terms of the international agreement.The Open Skies Treaty allows states to perform certain number of observation flights over each other’s’ territories. The accord was signed in Helsinki, Finland in 1992 and took effect in 2002. The 34 signatories include NATO allies, Eastern European members of the former Warsaw Pact, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia.Russia denied committing any violations of the Treaty, saying the accusations are groundless, and insisting that Moscow is fully committed to the accord.The claim is false – Russia’s violations of the Treaty are documented in the annual compliance reports that are publicly available on the U.S. State Department website. The U.S. says the Russian government sets distance limits on flights over the Kaliningrad Oblast, imposes altitude restrictions for the Moscow region, denies permission for Open Skies aircraft to fly within 10 kilometers of the Russian border with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.The limits set by Russia are forbidden by the treaty. For its own observation flights over the United States, Russia uses aircraft with high-resolution digital electro-optical sensors – the use of the sensors is controversial.In 2016, a Brookings Institution report said U.S. objections to the sensors “comes as something of a surprise.” The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, at the time, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, testified “digital techniques allow Russia, in my opinion, to get incredible foundational intelligence on critical infrastructure, bases, ports, all of our facilities, so from my perspective, it gives them a significant advantage.”The Question: Stay in or Withdraw From Treaties With Russia“One thing is completely clear. The State Department does not fabricate charges of Russian arms control violations. They typically do the opposite,” U.S. arms control expert and a senior analyst at the National Institute for Public Policy Mark Schneider told Polygraph.info.Schneider believes the U.S. must withdraw from other agreements with Russia, that “constrain our military and are being violated by the Russia,” including the New Start and the INF Treaty.“Russia always lies about its compliance record. Its compliance record is generally compliance to the extent convenient,” Schneider said. Robert McCreight, Adjunct Professor at the George Mason UniversityRobert McCreight, Adjunct Professor at the George Mason University believes, that despite Russia’s noncompliance, the Open Skies Treaty is remains essential to the U.S. and especially to its allies in Eastern Europe. “The Treaty provides valuable information, especially for our Allies and partners that do not have the same imaging capabilities as the U.S.,” McCreight told Polygraph.info.Still, McCreight said the distance limitations and other restrictions Russia imposes for the flights over its territory give “Russia the ability to move weapons or other assets out of the flight path and thereby prevent treaty members from getting an accurate picture of Russian military assets, comprising the purpose of the treaty.”The issue of the digital sensors, mentioned earlier in this article, also seems to play a part in the question of whether some experts in the West consider the Open Skies Treaty useful. Brookings said the U.S. objections came after Russia “operationalized the capability first,” that the U.S. was fully aware of Russia’s move and was taking its own steps to replace“One thus has to wonder whether this debate is about the new Russian sensors, or whether it is about the value of the treaty itself,” Pfier and Ben-Chorin wrote, their own conclusion being that the Treaty still has value to the U.S. despite what they saw as superior satellite reconnaissance capabilities. .Editors note:An e-mail from Canadian open source analyst Steffan Watkins convinced us to reconsider an assertion that the digital sensors violate the treaty. Watkins is widely quoted in a number of mainstream publications on his open source research on naval vessel movements.

These reports offer detailed forensic analyses unveiling the cyber espionage and criminal hacking activities of the group as well as demonstrating their affiliation with the Russian military intelligence/Russian government.The groups’ multiple nicknames have been revealed, they include Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28, Sofacy, STRONTIUM and others.The detailed forensic evidence of Fancy Bear’s criminal activities and its direct connection to the Russian state was published in April 2017 by a Tokyo, Japan-based cyber security firm Trend Micro.For over the seven years, Trend Micro tracked and documented Fancy Bear’s activities. The security firm has known of Fancy Bear’s existence since 2004. The chronology of the groups’ cybercrimes documented in the report begins in June 2014.During two years – 2014 to 2015, Fancy Bear:Compromised Polish government Websites;Attacked a U.S. nuclear fuel dealer, setting up fake Outlook Access login pages for its employees;Launched fake login page attacks against American and EU military and defense institutions;Attacked corporate accounts of 55 employees of a U.S. newspaper; Launched a massive Gmail phishing attack against three popular YouTube bloggers after they interviewed then-president Barack Obama;Started using malicious iOS applications for espionage;Launched an attack against NATO members;Attacked the French channel, TV5Monde, putting its global channels off air;Launched a domestic spying campaign targeting Russian dissidents, including the spouses of senior U.S. officials;Set up a fake server mimicking the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) server of the Safety Board and created a fake Outlook Web Access server to target the MH17 investigation;Launched a spear phishing Email attack against multiple foreign ministries worldwide using the Adobe Flash exploit code.The Trend Micro report said in 2016 alone, the groups’ activities increased by 400 percent becoming more focused on cyber espionage, targeted cyber propaganda campaigns and hacking of high profile political targets. During that presidential election year, United States political groups and individuals dominated the groups’ targeting, though among other victims were the Bulgarian army, the Polish Defense Ministry, Turkish and Arabic media outlets, Turkish, German, and French political parties, the Parliament of Montenegro, the World Anti-Doping agency and many others.Polygraph.info has previously debunked the Russian denials that Fancy Bearhacked into the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and published confidential medical data of U.S. athletes.A cyber security and forensic consulting firm, FireEye Inc., d/b/a Mandiant, hired by WADA conducted an investigation into Fancy Bear, which, the firm said, led to the Russian military intelligence.WADA then published a report calling the Fancy Bear, a “Russian cyber espionage group” which revealed evidence of the group’s affiliation with the Russian military.France - French presidential election candidate Marine Le Pen (2ndL) and French presidential election candidate Emmanuel Macron (R) arrive to pose prior to the start of a live brodcast face-to-face televised debate in television studios, Paris, May 03, 2017We have also debunked a denial of Russia’s cyberattacks targeting the campaign of France’s then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron.

One company, JSC Concern Almaz-Antey – a major government contractor made to the top 10, moving up from 11th last year to 8th this year.The Defense News ranking shows, that 100% of JSC Almaz-Antey’s revenue comes from defense which accounted for a 39% increase from $6.58 billion in 2016 to $9.1 billion in 2018. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute rank for JSC Almaz-Antey is slightly lower -- 24th in 2016 but still up from 26th in 2015.The Russian state media reported the ranking as the nation’s major achievement emphasizing the accomplishment despite the fact that for the last four years the company has been under sanctions, both from the United States and the European Union.The CEO of JSC Concern Almaz-Antey Yan Novikov in a statement regarding his firm’s 2018 ranking specifically pointed to the expansion of the company’s exports in spite of the sanctions. He said Almaz-Antey delivers its products to global arms markets directly and via state defense agency Rosoboronexport, which is also under U.S. and EU sanctions.“For the rest of the world both the U.S. and EU sanctions do not really mean anything,” Siemon Wezeman Senior Researcher Arms and Military Expenditure Program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) told Polygraph.info.“Thus, Russia could and did just go on selling weapons to other countries. As long a no U.S. or European actors, territory or components are involved, there is no problem for either Russia or the buyer,” Wezeman said.The SIPRI 2018 report places Russia as the second [after the United States] largest arm exporter in the world with 22 percent of global share.The success of JSC Concern Almaz-Antey’s “is not surprising,” Wezeman said. The company produces “highly advanced air defense systems that do very well in Russia and the world market with only limited competition, selling for example to India, Vietnam, China, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey.”Almaz-Antey’s most famous or, rather, infamous product is the Buk missile system, the same one used to shoot down the Malaysian passenger jet MH-17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. The Joint Investigation Team said Russia was responsible, and identified the Buk, and the Russian military unit to which the individual missile was assigned.In 2015, Almaz-Antey's CEO Yan Novikov said evidence showed the plane was indeed hit by one of its BUK missile systems, but that the weapon was an older Soviet model no longer used by the Russian military. The later has been debunked as a false claim.There are several factors complicating analysis of the export-import schemes and mapping Russian arms trade, mainly due to the lack of transparency.In November 2016, Vladimir Putin signed a presidential decree making “top secret” all information regarding “Russian Federation military-technical cooperation with foreign states,” stating that “distribution of such information can cause damage to the state security.”“Almaz-Antey has, since 2014, not published any official data and its results could only be estimated based on various pieces of information from company statements or other sources,” Wezeman said.;http://people.defensenews.com/top-100/,http://tass.com/defense/1017092,http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20140716.aspx,http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/cfsp/sanctions/docs/measures_en.pdf,http://www.almaz-antey.ru/press-sluzhba/press-relizy-kontserna/kontsern-vko-almaz-antey-uprochil-svoi-pozitsii-v-mirovom-reytinge-krupneyshikh-proizvoditeley-oruzh/,http://www.voanews.com/a/russia-missile-maker-contradicts-dutch-mh17-report/3004192.html,http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201611220047?index=0&rangeSize=1;Russian Maker of Missile that Shot Down MH-17 Reports Increased Global Sales, Even Under Sanctions;;;;;;

In a contrast to NATO’s behavior, Shoigu said, Russia’s military “demonstrates openness, friendliness and the absence of any sort of aggression against foreign countries.” He claimed these qualities were on display during the World Cup, which Russia hosted in mid-July. In reality, the Russian military stands accused of war crimes in Russia’s own North Caucasus region and in Syria; of provocative, aggressive and dangerous behavior in international airspace and waters; of brutal covert operations around the world, including shooting down the Malaysian passenger jet MH-17, which killed 268 people; the aggressive online operations of its intelligence units in the United States and France, as well as against the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA; shadowy involvement in the conflicts in eastern Ukraine and Georgia that claimed thousands of civilian victims; and of consistently violating international treaties and agreements; such as a nuclear disarmament treaty - that Russia says the U.S. is also violating.Ukraine -- An Ukrainian military commander (R) shows a rifle seized from Russian soldiers as General Staff commander Viktor Muzhenko looks on during a news conference in Kyiv, May 18, 2015We have left off this list the incidents in the United Kingdom involving poisoning by the nerve agent Novichok, because while these have been blamed directly on Russia, they have not been associated specifically with the Russian military. What the Experts SayStephen Blank, a Russia expert and senior fellow at the American Foreign Relations Council told Polygraph.info: “Of course, Shoigu is brazenly lying, as Russia does not accept the sovereignty or territorial integrity of any of the post-Soviet or post-Warsaw Pact states, and its representatives have stated as much and behaved in the same way many times.”The Russian Defense Ministry Tweet, above, shows a military drill that began in Crimea on July 25, 2018.“Russia has committed direct aggression against Georgia and Ukraine and threatened others even with nuclear weapons many times,” Blank said.Russia, Blank said, is launching a global war to subvert and corrupt governments and socio-economic-media-political institutions across the world, not just in Europe and the U.S. It also sponsors terrorism, whether in Ukraine or in the Middle East, where it supports Hezbollah and Hamas, and provides arms to Iran for arming Hezbollah. Stephen BlankRussia also carries out chemical warfare attacks abroad, as the incidents in the UK have shown, and apparently has revived its biological warfare program, Blank contended.He added that many, if not all of these cases also show that Russia has utter contempt for international treaties and law, as does its violation of arms control treaties, possibly including the New START treaty. Steven Pifer, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Polygraph.info: “There are numerous examples that contradict the Defense Minister's statement.”Ukraine -- An elderly man sits in front building destroyed during combat and shelling between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian militants in eastern city of Donetsk, 13, 2014“Russia is party to several arms control and confidence-building agreements that require transparency regarding military activities, but is in violation of those agreements,” Pifer said.“For example, Russia has ‘suspended’ its participation in the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty--even though the treaty has no provision for suspension--and does not provide the notifications and other transparency measures required by that agreement; has failed to provide all of the notifications and information required by the Vienna Document on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures; and has limited the access of overflights conducted over Russia under the Open Skies Treaty,” Pifer noted.He added: “As for the ‘absence of any sort of aggression against foreign countries’, one only has to consider Russia's military seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its ongoing conflict against Ukraine in the Donbas. NATO only began boosting its military presence on its eastern flank in 2014, as NATO allies became concerned about Russia's use of military force against Ukraine.”";https://www.rt.com/politics/434132-nato-russia-shoigu-defense/,https://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/pdf_inter_tchetchenie_va.pdf,https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A-HRC-37-72_EN.pdf,https://www.polygraph.info/a/us-russia-airspace-incident-black-sea/29010280.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-calls-us-warship-deployments-provocative/29071554.html,https://www.wired.com/2015/07/secret-cold-war-maps/,https://www.wired.com/2015/07/secret-cold-war-maps/,https://www.rferl.org/a/investigative-report-on-the-trail-of-the-12-indicted-russian-intelligence-officers/29376821.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlin-russia-france-macron-hucking-pawn-storm-trend-micro/28453235.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-ukraine-russia-donbas/28912097.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-georgia-2008-war-medvedev-/28670992.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-violated-the-budapest-memorandum/28985642.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-suspend-us-plutonium-treaty/28101862.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/novichok-poisoning-russia-us-fact-check/29215838.html,http://polygraph.info/,http://polygraph.info/;The Russian Military: ‘Friendly and Open’ or Aggressive and Dangerous – the Evidence;;;;;;

""The dumbest in the world: Trump Has Rated the Immigration Laws of the United States."" Russia Today report on U.S. immigration -- screen grab from TwitterThe story was only published in Russian and has not appeared on RT’s English-language website on the day of its publication. The article quoted and analyzed the U.S. President Donald Trump’s Tweet of June 29, in which he called for the immigration reform. Two experts quoted by Russia Today claimed that immigration is not an “acute” issue, but is heating up ahead of November’s Congressional elections.Immigration is complicated in the U.S., both in practice and its politics. The claim, itself, is inaccurate in singling out Mexicans as the issue, which implies that illegal immigration has, in effect, been completely reversed. We’ll get to that.The domestic politics surrounding the issue are just as complicated. To state, simply, that the issue is “not so acute,” is such a broad simplification as to be nearly meaningless. We have no such verdict. So, we have settled on “partially true,” though it was a close call on whether the RT article, overall, is “misleading.”Is ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy an easy path to higher poll ratings?Dmitry Evstafyev, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, argued that President Trump’s tough rhetoric on immigration is just a “propaganda” trick and the “easy path to raising his rating” in an effort to win the Republican majority in the upcoming Congressional elections. “For him the ultimate goal of meetings with Putin [and] Kim Jong-un, and of immigration policy, is to win the elections, because it is not just about victory but about survival,” Evstafyev said.The Russian expert’s claim about President Trump’s rhetoric on immigration being an “easy path to raising his (poll) rating” may have some factual basis.The highly-cited blog on U.S. politics and polls Five Thirty Eight, states the immigration issue might have been “most responsible for Trump’s winning the Republican nomination” in 2016. And in the general election vote, the national exit poll showed Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 31 percent “among voters who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country.""​Yet current polling can cast a cautionary shadow on the president as he and his party approach the mid-term election. The Gallup Poll has asked Americans since 1967 if they believe immigration should be kept at its present level, increased or decreased. Gallup finds in 2018, the number who believe immigration should be decreased is at its lowest level ever, 29 percent while those who respond that it should be increased is at its highest level, 28 percent.Whether that is a backlash to the president’s tough policies, or a reflection of something else is, you guessed it, complicated.Is Immigration ""not so acute"" an issue in the U.S.? The other expert cited by RT, Dmitry Mikheyev, dean of the Moscow International Business School, was a star of the Cold War era. According to his biography, after years in a Soviet prison, Mikheyev was handed over to the United States as a “radical dissident.” He became a U.S. citizen in 1985 and served as a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. After Vladimir Putin came to power, Mikheyev returned to Russia and became a supporter of Putin and adviser on Russia’s U.S. policy. Commenting the U.S. President’s immigration tweet, Mikheyev argued that the “issue of migration to the United States is not so acute.”“The outflow of Mexicans to their homeland is now higher than the influx into the States. The number illegally arriving in the country has also decreased,” Mikheyev said.Mikheyev is right that the number of illegal arrivals on the U.S. Southwest border has decreased and by quite a bit.In 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a comprehensive report on the Southwest border, reported the peak of illegal entries reached 1.8 million in the year 2000. The numbers fluctuated for several years but dropped precipitously during and after the 2008 economic crisis to 170,000 by 2016.Apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the U.S. border are another measure of declining illegal immigration. The U.S. Customers and Border Patrol statistics for the last four years show a steady decrease of apprehensions -- from half a million in 2014 to 304,000 in 2017. ​In the first nine months of this fiscal year, apprehensions stand at 382,526, up from last year but still trending downward relative to previous years.So there is at least a kernel of truth in Mikheyev’s analysis, though his focus on Mexicans is odd, reflecting perhaps the former Hudson Institute pundit’s recent isolation from U.S. culture.The combined flow of immigrants from Central American countries, El Salvador, Guatamala and Honduras, outpaced Mexicans beginning 2014. In 2016, the Pew Research Center did report more Mexicans were leaving the U.S. than entering it. Yet, Mexicans are still a significant factor. So far this year 12,137 family members have tried to cross. Compare to 2,775 from El Salvador, 9,146 from Guatemala and 5,841 from Honduras. Immigration to the U.S. fluctuates over time but a constant is that many Americans consider their country to be ‘a nation of immigrants.’ The question of “who” and “how many” is a political issue. Amid the recent mass protests against the “zero tolerance” immigration policy, President Trump’s approval ratings have fallen to 35 percent – his lowest, according to a CNN poll.";https://russian.rt.com/world/article/531508-tramp-migranty-zakon,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-polls-showing-daca-as-popular-even-among-republicans-dont-tell-the-whole-story/,https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls,http://www.cbs-mba.ru/teachers/mixeev.htm,https://outlook.office.com/owa/?realm=bbg.gov&path=/attachmentlightbox,http:// https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration,https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Dec/BP%20Total%20Apps%2C%20Mexico%2C%20OTM%20FY2000-FY2017.pd,http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/#tweets,https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/ofo-sw-border-inadmissibles,https://abcnews.go.com/News/families-belong-marches-nation-rebuke-tolerance-policy/story?id=56282599,https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-approval-rating-immigration-210400996.html;Russia Today’s Take on the US Immigration Debate Ignores Complexity;;;;;;

At the time of his detention, Grigoryan was immune from criminal prosecution as a member of Parliament.Armenian Prosecutor General Arthur Davtyan said Grigoryan was charged with illegal possession of firearms. He also requested an “extraordinary meeting” of the National Assembly asking the lawmakers to revoke Grigoryan’s immunity and to approve his criminal prosecution.The initial reaction of the general’s political allies in the Armenian Republican Party to the detention of one of the country's leading figures was one of outrage and denial. The general has been decorated as a hero for his leading role in the creation of Armenian voluntary army, which fought against neighboring Azerbaijani forces for the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabach region. One of the party’s leaders, Eduard Sharmazanov, deputy chairman of the National Assembly and Republican Party press secretary spoke to Radio Free Europe after visiting Grigoryan in detention. He called the case against the general “unacceptable, illegal, unconstitutional” and “fabricated.”We have settled on the verdict of “misleading,” because of a later comment from Sharmazanov. As you will see, he has yet to revise his initial accusation that charges were “fabricated.”On June 17, newly elected Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan went live on Facebook pointing to more accusations against Grigoryan.Armenia - PM Nikol Pashinyan during Facebook Live, Yerevan, Jun 17, 2018“I would like to clearly state that the detention of Marvel Grigoryan is tied not only with the possession of the large amounts of illegal weapons and ammunition. It is also connected with suspicion that he was involved in appropriation and theft of the aid intended for the army,” Pashinyan said. The prime minister’s accusations were confirmed by the Armenian security service, which published a video of the search of a house owned by Grigoryan in the city of Echmiadzin.EmbedshareArmenian security service published a video of the search of Manvel Grigoryan's houseEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:07:120:00Along with an arsenal of hundreds of firearms, rockets and thousands of packs of ammunition, the video showed stacks of paper boxes marked as “humanitarian aid” and packed with canned food, first aid supplies and clothes. Security service personnel showed handwritten letters to soldiers from children who had collected and donated the aid for the soldiers. The video also showed Grigoryan’s collection of vintage cars and his private zoo, with exotic animals kept in small cages.“He was illegally appropriating the food the school students have been collecting for the soldiers and feeding it to his animals – the bears, the tigers and others,” Prime Minister Pashinyan said.The security service’s video provoked a wave of public outrage in Armenia.On the evening of June 17, the general’s son, Karen Grigoryan, announced on Facebook his resignation as mayor of the city of Echmiadzin.Republican Party members publicly condemned Grigoryan's actions, calling them “unacceptable and disgusting.” They also stated that they “respect the presumption of innocence, but if the charges brought against him (are) proved according the law, he must be held accountable.”One indication of the strong feelings in Armenia: Somebody edited Grigoryan’s Wikipedia page, adding the word “traitor” to his career achievements, while “Hero of Corruption” was added in next to the picture of the Armenian Order of Hero he had been awarded.Screenshot of a vandalized Wikipedia page of the Armenian General Manvel GrigoryanOn June 19, Armenia’s National Assembly revoked Manvel Grigoryan’s parliamentary immunity and approved his criminal prosecution, with the approval of almost all the general’s supporters in the Republican Party.Sharmazanov has shifted his opinion, saying: “If all of this turns out to be true, I think this has no justification that is my opinion.” Still, he has not publicly taken back his initial statement that the charges were “fabricated,” even as the general’s defense rests on the notion.Later on June 19, Grigoryan’s legal team said he rejects all accusations, including any knowledge of the goods and weapons stocked on the premises of the property he claims he barely visits twice a year.The VOA Armenian Service contributed to this report.;http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29293160.html,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29294434.html,https://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29293287.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/06/2/24/24b91516-bd13-475f-a3ef-ffd5f4caaa68_mobile.mp4,/a/armenia-generals-arrest-fact-check/6740902.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740902.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740902.html&text=Armenian+security+service+published+a+video+of+the+search+of+Manvel+Grigoryan%27s+house,/a/6740902.html,/embed/player/Article/6740902.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29294077.html,http://https://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29293806.html,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29294066.html,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29294603.html,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvel_Grigoryan,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29303977.html,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29294414.html,http://rus.azatutyun.am/a/29304688.html;Armenia: General’s Allies Allow Prosecution After Party Leader Called Charges “Fabricated”;;;;;;

These include the country’s economic stagnation, corruption, and overexploitation of natural resources; the incompetence of government agencies; and even the Kremlin’s use of information warfare.A line in the song -- “It’s not for nothing we terrified [the planet] with a missile” -- seems to be a reference to President Vladimir Putin’s demonstration on March 1 of what he called an “invincible ballistic missile.”EmbedsharePutin AFP Invincible Nuclear WeaponEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:03:550:00After Slepakov sings that Russia is ready for the World Cup, he adds: “But there is only one “but”: Our team, frankly, is sh-t.”To prove his point, the comedian introduces into his song Russia’s most controversial political figure – the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.Slepakov sings that the Russian team would not be capable of winning the World Cup even if President Putin were to appoint Kadyrov as its new coach, which would represent an imminent death threat to team members.Hand-picked and favored by Putin, Kadyrov has repeatedly declared his loyalty to the Russian president and calls himself Putin’s “foot soldier.”Kadyrov is also widely seen as the most feared man in Russia, due to his record of human rights abuses and alleged personal participation in torturing of the prisoners held in secret locations.Despite the satirical form of Slepakov’s song and its use of hyperbole, it is in general factually accurate, and his assessment of the Russian national team corresponds with the FIFA’s ranking.FIFA 2018 team ranking, RussiaIn FIFA’s June 7, 2018 ranking, the Russian national team was ranked 70th among the world’s 206 national teams, and given a “worst mover” red label.This latest FIFA ranking is the Russian national team’s lowest, having dropped from 20th place in 2014.FIFA 2014-2018 ranking for the Russian teamIf Russia, which qualified automatically as the hosts, cannot muster a win against Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday, the team will equal a winless record set in 1912, when the country was still ruled by Tsar Nicholas II, and matched in 1998, the Russian newspaper The Moscow Times reported.More than 145 million Russians are football fans, but the national team and its fans have been accused bad behavior, including racism and violence.Still, President Vladimir Putin promised the World Cup in Russia will be flawless.Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on June 14, that 15 foreign leaders attended the World Cup’s opening ceremony. They included eight from neighboring former Soviet countries and two from South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- the Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia.";/a/29081265.html,https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2018/03/c/c8/c8f74f8c-6671-4f7e-8ac9-8595b75c25a5_mobile.mp4,/a/fifa-2018-russia-team-fact-check/6740875.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740875.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740875.html&text=Putin+AFP+Invincible+Nuclear+Weapon,/a/6740875.html,/embed/player/Article/6740875.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,/a/28983182.html,/a/29057525.html,http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html,http://https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/aging-and-inexperienced-meet-russias-national-football-team-61785,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/13/russia-world-cup-hosts-2018-poor-national-side,/a/29207210.html,/a/29010199.html,http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/defiant-russia-welcomes-boycott-free-world-cup/ar-AAyDEjZ;FIFA2018: Russian Comedian Sings the National Team is “Sh-t”;;;;;;

Its Facebook page has more than 100,000 likes and followers.The Soros narrative is a story that has meandered across the Atlantic between Russia nationalists and conspiracy theorists in the U.S., alighting on U.S. actress Roseanne Barr’s Twitter feed this week. Barr was fired by a U.S. television network on May 29 for tweets many said were racist. That same day, she repeated the false Nazi/Soros narrative, which seems to fit together neatly in the world of Ya Russkiy.English language version of the ""Soros Nazi"" Fake PosterOn April 22, Ya Russkiy published an article headlined “SS-man George Soros,” with a poster depicting a young man in a Nazi uniform and a caption in Russian that read: “This is George Soros. Remember this next time the Soros-funded liberals call you a racist, fascist or Nazi.” There is also a Russian translation of the caption.Russian Language Vesrion of the ""Soros Nazi"" posterThis same article has been recycled repeatedly, re-appearing on different Russian platforms. It was posted on December 10, 2016, by a different Russian nationalist website, kramola.info.With the addition of a recent photo of George Soros, the same piece was posted on December 12, 2016, by the well-known anti-Ukrainian website Antimaidan.Despite its mysterious popularity among Russian ultra-nationalists, the story is false and been thoroughly debunked.Google image search results for the picture from ""Soros Nazi"" posterThe man identified on the poster as “George Soros” is in fact Oskar Groening, a Nazi SS junior squad leader known as the “bookkeeper of Auschwitz,” the Nazi concentration camp. Groening was one of the last Germans charged with war crimes and died this past March at the age of 96.The picture of Oskar Goering cut our of the ""Soros Nazi"" posterRussia banned Soros-founded NGOs in November 2015 after the government said that they “posed a threat to the constitutional order of the country” and designated them as “undesirables.”Across the Atlantic, the Russian George Soros-Nazi narrative resonates with a conspiracy theory pushed by InfoWars founder Alex Jones. It is also very popular with believers in the “Illuminati” conspiracy, who target George Soros as often as do the Russian nationalist websites.“It is hard to prove collusion but this is a striking coincidence,” British journalist and author Edward Lucas told Polygraph.info. “I doubt U.S. far-right circles are sufficiently well-informed about wartime Hungary to understand this, whereas Russian ex-KGB types are hyper-alert for any sign of ‘fascist’ backgrounds among their adversaries and would instantly see the significance.”The Russian search engine Yandex.ru links together keywords ""Nazi"" ""Fascist"" ""Soros"" and ""Liberal""In the United States, fact checkers report the early stories labeling the teenage Soros as a Nazi go back to a “misreading” of a 1998 CBS 60 minutes interview. Some of the anti-Soros claims in the U.S. date as far back as the year 2000, and have been repeated in different forms recently.This week the topic made another wave of headlines in the United States, after the popular American TV actress Roseanne Barr, in a Twitter exchange with Chelsea Clinton, accused Soros of being a Nazi “who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth.”George Soros responded to Barr, saying her comments were an “insult to Holocaust survivors.”""George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust,"" Soros's spokesperson said.";http://ya-russ.ru/,http://www.facebook.com/www.russ.press/,http://ya-russ.ru/esesovets-dzhordzh-soros/,http://www.kramola.info/blogs/metody-genocida/esesovec-dzhordzh-soros,http://amdn.news/esesoviets-dzhordzh-soros,http://https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/george-soros-ss-nazi-germany/,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/obituaries/oskar-groning-the-bookkeeper-of-auschwitz-is-dead-at-96.html,http://meduza.io/feature/2015/12/01/chto-sdelal-fond-sorosa-v-rossii,http://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-leader-of-the-Illuminati,http://www.snopes.com/fact-check/george-soros-ss-nazi-germany/,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/roseanne-george-soros-twitter.html,http://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2018/05/29/roseanne-barr-under-fire-for-tweets-about-valerie-jarrett-and-chelsea-clinton/,http://http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/389753-soros-responds-to-roseanne-her-comments-are-an-insult-to;What Do Russian Nationalists, Alex Jones and Roseanne Have in Common?;;;;;;

While the initial verdict was directed at Vučić’s appreciation for Russia’s veto, and the current Serbian leader’s nod toward 1990s propaganda that contributed to ethnic violence and killing, we agree the 20th suffering and death should be acknowledged and highlighted.))During a meeting in the Kremlin on May 8, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Serbs “are the people who suffered the most over the last century.” Vučić thanked Putin for saving Serbia from the “stigma of genocide” by vetoing a “British resolution in the U.N.”The “British resolution” Vučić referred to was a draft U.N. Security Council resolution proposed jointly by Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland and the United States in 2015 calling for the actions of Serbian troops during the war in the Balkans to be recognized as “the crime of genocide, proven war crimes and crimes against humanity.”On July 8, 2015, ten out of fifteen U.N. Security Council members voted for the resolution, four abstained and Russia vetoed it.Based on documentary evidence, including photos and videos, the U.N. estimated that there were thousands of cases of sexual violence -- with victims on all sides --during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including at Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb troops executed 8,372 boys and men in just five days in July 1995. This happened despite the fact that Srebrenica was declared a “safe area” for refugees under United Nations protection.BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA -- A woman reacts near a grave of her family members in the Memorial center Potocari near Srebrenica, November 22, 2017The events described in the draft resolution took place in the Balkans during the series of violent conflicts in the 1990s, amid the breakup of Yugoslavia into independent states. The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions from their homes. It was followed by the Kosovo conflict, which broke out after the province’s majority Albanian population called for independence from Serbia.On July 9, 2015, the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress adopted resolutions describing the Srebrenica crimes as genocide.In 2010, the Serbian Parliament issued a declaration apologizing for the Srebrenica massacre.Aleksandar Vučić’s description of the Serbs as the victims who suffered the most is not new: in fact, it echoes ex-Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, whose nationalist propaganda reportedly played a major role in the mass atrocities Serbian troops committed during the war.Serbia -- A man poses for a photograph next to the grave of late Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in the town of Pozarevac, March 11, 2016As for Vučić’s description of the Serbs as the “the people who suffered the most over the last century,” according the “Bosnian Book of Dead,” an independent study conducted by the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo in the mid-2000s, 97,207 people were killed in the Bosnian war, 25 percent of whom were Serbs, 8 percent Croatians and 65 percent Bosnian Muslims.20th Century Context:The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholars estimate 169 million people were victims of mass atrocities worldwide in the 20th century and Serbs were among the victims.At the epicenter at beginning of World War I, there is little doubt the Serb population was one of many that suffered among the worst atrocities committed by invading armies. The World War I encyclopedia managed by Freie Universität Berlin in Germany reports on the brutality of the Austro-Hungarian invaders who “treated the entire Serb civilian population as combatants or participants.”  While the scholars say the extent of atrocities is not fully researched, estimates of the civilian death toll ranged from 3,500 up to 30,000. During World War II, the fascist Ustasa government of Croatia slaughtered, by some estimates up to 2 million Serbs, Roma, and Jews in Croatia – “killings that were so brutal they appalled even the Nazis,” according to Globalsecurity.org, an oft-cited compilation of scholarship and military information and history. In Serbia, the German puppet regime tried to “reign in the violence,” though Nazi reprisals continued against the resistance. The 1990’s wars over the breakup of Yugoslavia are considered to be “the bloodiest” since World War II. The Bosnia Serb push to create the Republika Srpska began “with the idea of creating an ethnically pure Serbian enclave in northern and eastern Bosnia.”  The “ethnic cleansing” of Muslim enclaves resulted in “Europe’s first concentration camps since World War II.” While Croat and Muslim forces committed similar acts, there were “massive counts of rape and sexual assault of Muslim women” and “mass executions of Muslim men and boys of military age.” The Srebrenica massacre is the “most infamous” of these reports.

According to a transcript of his speech posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website, Shulgin also put forward what he said was documentary evidence of his claim: he said a search of the “google.patents.com” data base using the keyword “Novichok” found “more than 140 patents granted in the United States related to the use of, and protection from, the impact of the ‘Novichok’ chemical warfare agent.”​The Russian ambassador’s claim contains several errors.First, the correct address of the actual source is “patents.google.com,” not “google.patents.com.”Secondly, a search of “patents.google.com” using the keyword “Novichok” yields 59 results, not 140. Thirdly, among the 59 results, there are no patents for “producing” or “using” Novichok. Rather, the results are for such things as the “detection” and “composition” of Novichok series nerve agents, as well as “detoxification,” “prevention” and treatment of poisoning caused by Novichok series nerve agents.​Asked to comment on what Shulgin said, Paul Fucito, press secretary of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office told Polygraph.info: “I could not begin to speculate on the claim.”Fucito added: “After a thorough search, we cannot find anything to support claims for any patents issued for the production of a combat substance. The term ‘Novichok’ has appeared, however, in issued U.S. patents for various treatments (including exposure to chemicals/toxins) and the detection of substances.”Although Russia’s OPCW representative referred to the public domain, there are patents and licenses issued in the U.S. under the Executive Order for Classified National Security Information, and those are not accessible in the patents.google.com database to which Shulgin referred in his speech at The Hague.The office of Russia’s permanent representative to the OPCW in The Hague, Netherlands, did not respond to Polygraph.info’s request for a copy of the documentary evidence Alexander Shulgin presented at the April 18 meeting.The British government has accused the Russian government of using a nerve agent to poison former Russian military intelligence colonel Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the British city of Salisbury on March 4.After conducting an independent examination of samples from Britain, the OPCW concurred with the findings of the British government’s Porton Down research facility, finding “the toxic chemical was of high purity.” The OPCW was silent on the source of the poison.The incident led to a diplomatic crisis, with about 20 countries, including the United States, expelling Russian diplomats.Russia denied any connection to the poisoning and during the two months following the incident produced multiple “alternative versions” of the incident in Salisbury.EU Mythbusters, a European Union source for combating Russian disinformation, counted 37 different versions voiced by Russian officials or state media.

Sargsyan, who previously served as Armenia’s president, stepped down as prime minister amid mass protests.ARMENIA -- People celebrate after the release of the leader of Armenia's mass anti-government protests Nikol Pashinian in Yerevan, April 23, 2018Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said that the political changes in Armenia will not affect cooperation between the two nations and that Russia will remain Armenia’s closest ally.Armenia, a Eurasian country half the size of the U.S. state of West Virginia, is surrounded by Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia.Armenia’s alliance with Russia is dictated by a “need to survive,” Serzh Sargsyan said during his May 2015 visit to Washington, DC to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.Armenia is a member of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union which was set up as a counterbalance to the European Union. Moscow sells Armenia gas at domestic Russian prices and provides it with financial aid for various educational and cultural programs. Armenia is in the process of “re-engineering” its state finance system with support from the Russian Trust Fund.Armenia’s foreign trade largely relies on Russia.Since 1988, Armenia has been involved in an armed conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict led to a near-total blockade of Armenia’s borders: its border with Azerbaijan and its ally Turkey have been completely closed, with only its border with Georgia remaining open.Nagorno-Karabakh -- NK Defense Ministry publishes a video of military equipment moving along the line of contact, 22Apr2018Russia has assumed the role of international mediator in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. However, at the same time, Moscow sells weapons to both Armenia and Azerbaijan.Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said on April 23 that Russia is not interfering in Armenia and that the events are “absolutely Armenia’s domestic affair,” but declined to comment whether Yerevan consulted with Moscow regarding the current situation.While Peskov’s claim of non-interference seems to be true, other developments suggest it is highly unlikely Russia will stand on sidelines if anything in Armenia goes entirely against Moscow’s interests.This week, the Armenian Defense Ministry announced it is discussing with Moscow the deployment of Russian military police to the permanent Russian military base in Gyumri, a northeastern city near Armenia’s borders with Turkey. The Armenian Defense Ministry has provided no details about the numbers of Russian military police, saying only that the move is targeted “at maintaining discipline” at the base.After Sargsyn's resignation, Karen Karapetyan, ex-prime minister and former head of national gas distributing company ArmRosGazprom and later Yerevan mayor, has assumed the office as the acting prime minister. Karapetyan lived in Moscow, where he served as the first vice-president of Gazprombank and the deputy CEO of Russian gas producer Gazprom’s GAZP.MM Mezhregiongaz unit. Gazprom is Russia's state-controlled energy giant targeted in the U.S. sanctions.ARMENIA -- An anti-government rally in central Yerevan, April 23, 2018 -- A huge impromptu street party broke out on Mashtots, the main avenue of Yerevan today after Prime Minister Sarkisian announced his resignation after days of protests.;http://news.am/eng/news/447880.html,/a/29096430.html,http://tass.ru/politika/5151349,http://idea.usaid.gov/cd/armenia?comparisonGroup=region,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/05/07/why-armenia-turned-to-russia-instead-of-the-west/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4b0d5ecc313d,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386701468206966299/pdf/816470CAS0AM0C00Box379845B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://russian-trade.com/reports-and-reviews/2017-02/torgovlya-mezhdu-rossiey-i-armeniey-v-2016-g/,http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/nagorno-karabakh.htm,http://dailycaller.com/2018/04/09/armenia-isolated-backwater-dump-because-of-russia/#,http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21646947-russian-ally-rues-its-dependence-upon-moscow-stuck-each-other,http://eurasianet.org/node/72581,http://tass.com/politics/1001252,http://news.am/eng/news/443259.html,http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article209602824.html,https://www.ft.com/content/8e23c932-3a50-11e4-8ee4-00144feabdc0;Russia is not worried about political turmoil in Armenia;;;;;;

Ambassador to Ukraine, told Polygraph.info via email.“Lavrov’s comments are really nothing more than political bluster, not a serious charge,” said Walter Richmond, a genocide scholar and Professor of Russian Studies at Occidental College, Los Angeles.“There is no reasonable case for labeling U.S. sanctions on Russia ‘genocide’,” Richmond told Polygrapy.info. “Intent to destroy an ethnic group in whole or in part is clearly not present. The intended effects of the sanctions do not meet any of the five standards for determining a genocide has taken place.”Citing the U.N. definition of genocide, Pifer asked rhetorically: “The U.S. and Western sanctions against Russia have caused financial problems for a small number of Russian individuals and Russian companies, and have reduced the Russian gross domestic product by between one-half and one percent of gross domestic product -- but the death of anyone?”Richmond added: “Point Three of the U.N. Genocide Convention [Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part] is the only standard that could be in any way construed to be pertinent in this case, i.e. arguing that the damage the Russian economy has experienced as a result of the sanctions is causing ‘serious bodily or mental harm’ to the Russian people. But such an argument has no foundation if the facts are examined.”Pifer pointed out that the Russian government's counter-sanction of banning the import of Western foodstuffs has had a “greater impact on the general Russian population” than the U.S. sanctions have had.Richmond challenges Lavrov’s claim that during the Cold War “there was no obsession with Russophobia.” That, he said, “contradicts vast amounts of evidence that Russophobia went hand in hand with the U.S. position at that time, as well as my own personal experience as a child growing up in the 1960s.”The United States sanctions against individuals and entities in Russia fall under three programs: The “Magnitsky Sanctions,” the “Ukraine-Russia Related Sanctions,” the “Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.”;http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.html,http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16162244-the-circassian-genocide,http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/magnitsky.aspx,http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/ukraine.aspx,http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/caatsa.aspx;Russia Accuses the United States of “Genocide Through Sanctions”;;;;;;

In the two-part film, over four hours in length, the Russian leader highlights what he views as his achievements during his 18 years in power and attempts to justify decisions he made that were widely criticized as wrong.While “Putin,” the documentary, concedes very few errors, it lists many “achievements,” including the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea in 2014, which is portrayed as the biggest diamond in the Russian leader’s crown of successes.During the opening two minutes of the four-hour documentary, its author, presidential campaign press secretary Andrey Kondrashov asks Putin: “Are there any circumstances under which you would be ready to give away Crimea and Sevastopol?” Putin responded: “What, have you lost your mind?! There are no such circumstances and there never will be!”EmbedsharePutin on CrimeaEmbedshareThe code has been copied to your clipboard.widthpxheightpxShare on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboardNo media source currently available0:000:01:180:00In December 2017, Putin cited the Soviet government’s decision in 1954 to hand Crimea over to Ukraine, which he said was illegal.The claim is false, and was debunked by none other than Putin himself in a 2008 interview with the German broadcaster ARD. “The question about Russia having any such goals seems to me has a provocative meaning,” Putin said when the host asked whether Russia had plans to invade Ukraine and take Crimea. “Crimea is absolutely not a disputed territory.”​The Kursk: Putin’s “First Lie”In the documentary, Putin addresses the the sinking of the submarine Kursk in 2000, without admittingany mistake in his reaction, or lack of it. Putin maintained a low profile for ten days as the 118 marines on board slowly suffocated. During that same time, the Kremlin rejected all offers from foreign actors to help rescue the crew. ​In the March 11 documentary, Putin blames the disaster on his then military advisers.But Boris Kuznetsov, a prominent Moscow lawyer, said the Kursk tragedy was a “turning point” for modern Russia and Putin's ""first lie.""Crimea and the Presidential ElectionOn March 14, Putin visited Crimea, where he inspected the construction of a bridge that will connect the peninsula with the Russian mainland.Putin also attended a mass rally celebrating the fourth anniversary of Crimea’s annexation. Along with that rally, there was a free concert -- part of a Russian government-funded project called “Crimean Spring” during the final two months before the presidential elections. As part of “Crimean Spring,” performances have been staged in cities across Russia and advertised with patriotic posters.The project is not formally part of Vladimir Putin’s campaign.“It is not an electoral event, it’s a rally that is not connected with the presidential elections,"" Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said on March 14.UKRAINE - Vladimir Putin on pre-election concert in Sevastopol, 14Mar2018Addressing the crowd in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, Putin said: “You have restored historical justice, which was violated back in the Soviet period, when Crimea and Sevastopol were illegally, even under Soviet law, torn away from the Russian Federation.”The Gallup polling agency found in July 2014 that Putin’s popularity had reached “its highest level in years, likely propelled by a groundswell of national pride with the annexation of Crimea in March on the heels of the Sochi Olympic Games in February.”In May 2017, Russia’s parliament moved the date of presidential election from traditional first Sunday of the month to March 18, the day in 2014 an agreement was signed in the Kremlin formalizing Crimea’s absorption in the Russian Federation.Crimea was omnipresent in Putin’s vocabulary during the four years after the annexation, and Polygraph.info fact-checked some of the Russian president’s statements in that regard. During a visit to Crimea in October 2016, he reiterated his position that it had become part of Russia thanks to the “active stand” taken by “engaged people” who had “decided for themselves” in a referendum.

The prime minister threatened to freeze some Russian government assets and she suspended high-level diplomat contacts, revoked the invitation to Lavrov to visit Britain this year and said the royal family would not attend the World Cup in Russia.. “The Government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible,” May said, noting “Russia’s record of conducting state sponsored assassinations.”Lavrov’s claim that Russia had “nothing to do” with the poisoning is false given that the poison used was developed in Russia.Tuesday, The White House also said President Trump agreed “that the Government of the Russian Federation must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to the used in the United Kingdom.” The statement was a “readout” of a telephone call between Trump and May.According to the Federation of American Scientists, in October 1991, Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who had worked for more than 25 years in the Soviet chemical weapons program, alleged that Moscow had developed a series of new and extremely lethal ""third generation"" nerve agents under a secret program code-named Foliant. His assertions were confirmed by two other scientists, Lev Fedorov and Vladimir Uglev. It was also claimed that Russia was working on developing new binary chemical warfare agents under the designation Novichok [""New Guy""].Mirzayanov alleged that Russia intended to test and produce binary chemical weapons after the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.According to experts, nerve agents of the “Novichok” group are the “deadliest ever made.”After accusing Russia of “indiscriminate” use of the poison, which “put the lives of innocent civilians at risk,” British Prime Minister May gave Russian President Vladimir Putin until midnight March 13 to explain or face “extensive measures.”Russia has responded with denials and counter-accusations and warned of reprisals of its own. “Moscow does not accept the groundless accusations or the language of ultimatums,” said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman. May said Moscow had treated the affair with “sarcasm, contempt and defiance.” “Russia’s position regarding the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter is limited to aggressive denial: we did not do that but that is going to happen to every traitor,” wrote Anton Orekh, a journalist with Echo of Moscow radio station.Ben Nimmo, a senior analyst with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Lab, highlighted and debunked the Russian government narrative regarding the poisoning via Twitter, saying it followed ”a familiar pattern: dismiss, distort, distract, dismay.”The Kremlin-funded media outlets RT and Sputnik posted series of reports implying that the British accusations are “anti-Russian propaganda” and a “provocation” cooked up by the U.S. and British intelligence services.Britain’s communications regulator, Ofcom, said that it would consider the implications of the prime minister’s statement for RT’s broadcast licenses – a threat to take regulatory action against the Russian state media outlet.""Should the UK investigating authorities determine that there was an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the UK, we would consider this relevant to our ongoing duty to be satisfied that RT is fit and proper,” Ofcom stated.";https://www.polygraph.info/a/ex-russian-spy-poisoned-uk-fact-check/29087958.html,https://www.polygraph.info/a/ex-russian-spy-poisoned-uk-fact-check/29087958.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-britain-skripal-novichok-23-diplomats-expelled/29098673.html,https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/cbw/cw.htm,http://www.businessinsider.com/novichok-scientist-vil-mirzayanov-describes-nerve-agent-used-on-sergei-skripal-2018-3,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5789391/russian-nerve-agent-theresa-may-salisbury-poisoning-novichok/,https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-responds-to-spy-attack/4297956.html,https://echo.msk.ru/programs/repl/2164684-echo/,https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201803081062350153-who-gains-from-poisonins-russian-ex-spy-uk/,https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2018/statement-on-rt-news-channel;UPDATED: Russia Falsely Denies Connection to the 'Deadliest' Poison Ever Made;;;;;;

And Volodin seems to imply that powerful American lawmakers would be immune, which is wrong.While several lawmakers who were accused have denied mistreatment and not stepped down, the powerful chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, resigned, last year following multiple allegations of misconduct. Sen. Al Franken, a prominent Democrat, also resigned in 2017. Two Republican House members said they would leave Congress, one through resignation and the other not seeking reelection later this year.Volodin and his deputy appeared to be making the female journalists the issue, rather than those who are accused.His deputy, Igor Lebedev, took Volodin’s advice to “change jobs” further --calling for the three female reporters to be barred from covering the Russian Parliament.“…I think, the sexual harassment accusations against Leonid Slutsky are severe violations of ethics, of the criminal code and an insult. We will be, on behalf of the fraction raising the issue of revoking the State Duma accreditation for these journalists,” Lebedev wrote on Twitter.​While Russian lawmakers appeared to protect eachother over the accusations,Pavel Gusev, the leader of the Moscow Union of Journalists said the union will launch an investigation on whether the three reporters have violated the journalistic code of ethics.“They have, to say it plainly, humiliated the profession,” Gusev said, referring to the three women, in an interview to New York based Russian language TV channel RTVi.In Russia, the #MeToo movement in the U.S. has been publicly shamed, while women across society who have lodged complaints of domestic abuse say there are few repercussions for the guilty men. A year ago, Putin’s government decriminalized many forms of domestic violence.In the U.S., the “paradigm-shifting power” of the #MeToo phenomenon has gained public support, and the participants lately have been praised as “silence breakers” and for their “revolutionary” contribution to the gender equality.​;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/28/journalist-accuses-lawmaker-sexual-harassment-metoo-movement/,http://themoscowtimes.com/news/bbc-journalist-accuses-russian-deputy-of-sexual-harassment-with-audio-recordings-60729,http://themoscowtimes.com/news/tv-producer-goes-public-sexual-harassment-claims-against-russian-deputy-60680,http://www.rbc.ru/politics/07/03/2018/5a9f9b8d9a7947a766486b21,http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/here-s-list-political-figures-accused-sexual-misconduct-n827821,http://rtvi.com/news/why-not-to-blame-victims/,http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/why-russias-metoo-moment-hasnt-happened/2018/02/25/0b8bbf92-0514-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html?utm_term=.e9ba5c9dbce4,http://www.nytimes.com/series/metoo-moment;Russian Parliament Leaders Falsely Imply Powerful US Lawmakers Are Immune to Charges of Sexual Abuse;;;;;;

The 66-year-old Russian exile and his 30-year-old daughter, who was visiting from Moscow, were found unconscious on a bench in the British city of Salisbury on March 4. Both remain in intensive care in hospital and unconscious, in critical but stable condition.U.K. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, “That forensic analysis has revealed the presence of a nerve agent and the incident is therefore being treated as attempted murder.”While Britain has not accused any Russian state actors of involvement in the poisoning, Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, Tuesday called Russia “a malign and disruptive force” and threatened new sanctions on Russia, if the Kremlin were found to have been responsible.Johnson’s comment drew a share Russian rebuttal. Earlier government-linked media and politicians in Russia took a defensive stance, claiming in advance that the Russian state had nothing to do with the crime.The Business Insider compiled a list of 15 deaths in Britain which intelligence authorities suspect could be involved Russia, including Alexander Litvinenko, a former officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB). He was poisoned by radioactive Polonium-210, believed to have been slipped into a cup of tea.The Russian embassy’s claim that Skripal was a “British spy working for MI6” rather than a Russian spy is based on the fact that he was a double agent working simultaneously for both the Russian and British intelligence services. Here is a short bio of Skripal compiled by Reuters:Who is Sergei Skripal - the Russian ex-spy poisoned in London, U.K.? BY REUTERSWhile the Russian Embassy’s claim about the double agent is not completely wrong, it is inaccurate to imply that Skripal was not a Russian spy, and even now there are questions surrounding Skripal's allegiances.Valery Morozov, another former Russian intelligence officer who now lives in exile in Britain, said Skripal was still working with Russian military intelligence.“You have a Russian military intelligence officer working in the Russian diplomatic service, living after retirement in the U.K. working in cybersecurity and every month going to the [Russian] embassy to meet military intelligence officers,” Morozov told Channel 4 News. Deepening the mystery of Skripal’s loyalties, the Telegraph newspaper claims it has obtained information that the poisoned spy was a close confidant of Christopher Steel, the British ex-spy who compiled the so-called “Trump dossier.” And there is Vladimir Putin’s infamous reaction to the 2010 exchange of a group of captured Russian “illegals” – undercover spies – living in the United States for a group of Russian intelligence agents accused of working for the West, including Skripal.,Putin, who was then prime minister, said: ""Traitors will kick the bucket. Trust me. These people betrayed their friends, their brothers in arms. Whatever they got in exchange for it, those 30 pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them.”Russia used a nerve agent in October 2002 when 912 people, many of them children, were held hostage in the Dubrovka theatre in Moscow for three days. Russian special forces filled the building with an unknown gas to neutralize the attackers, who had threatened to blow up the venue unless Russia pulled its troops out of Chechnya.The effects of the gas killed 125 people. The 40 attackers were shot after being knocked out by the gas. The hostage-takers themselves killed five people. At the time the Russian authorities refused to identify the nerve agent, that, the first responders and hospital personnel said, prevented them from saving more lives of the affected hostages.";https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/europe/uk-russia-spy-sergei-skripal.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/british-cobra-committee-briefed-on-alleged-poisoning-of-russian-double-agent/4284113.html,http://www.businessinsider.com/list-alleged-russian-assassinations-in-britain-litvinenko-2018-3?r=UK&IR=T,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-explainer/the-poisoning-of-former-russian-double-agent-sergei-skripal-idUSKCN1GK1QI,http://a.msn.com/09/en-gb/BBJZkV6?ocid=st,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/07/poisoned-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-close-consultant-linked/,https://www.rawstory.com/2012/10/deadly-gas-use-haunts-moscow-theater-hostages-10-years-later/,http://www.nord-ost.org/segodnya/ispolzovalis-dva-gaza_ru.html,http://www.nord-ost.org/doklad/prilozhenie-21.-postanovlenie-ob-otkaze-v-vozbuzhdenii-ugolovnogo-dela-ot-31.12.2002-g_ru.html;Russia Claims Poisoned Agent was 'Actually a British Spy,' Ignoring His Double Life;;;;;;

You can publish anything, and we see those indictments multiplying, the statements multiplying.” Lavrov added, “Until we see the facts, everything else is just blabber.”Under U.S. law, persons or organizations can be formally indicted only after a grand jury has found the evidence presented by a district attorney sufficient to bring a felony charge.The federal indictment brought February 16 by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller represents the most detailed allegations to date of illegal Russian meddling during the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.In announcing the indictment, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said: “[T]here is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.”Prosecutors in the U.S. often provide only basic facts sufficient to convince a grand jury, saving the key evidence for the trial -- which may mean that the 37-page Indictment is just the tip of the iceberg.But, even this purposely limited evidence is “absolutely damning,” according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab expert Ben Nimmo, especially combined with the previously published reports by Facebook and Twitter.The indictment says the U.S. election interference effort was called ""Project LaKHta,"" which spent more than $1 Million per month in 2016 on what it called ""information warfare"" against the U.S. “Lavrov’s statement is, as always a diversion. He is implying no facts are presented (in) the indictment, which is false,” Molly McKew, an information warfare analyst, told Polygraph.info via email.“The Mueller indictment of the Internet Research Agency is probably one of the most significant documents to date on modern intelligence gathering -- a window into operational design that we don't often get,” McKew said. McKew, an expert on Russian disinformation, testified before the Helsinki Commission in September 2017, where the CEO of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, John Lansing, also spoke. McKew's firm, Fianna Strategies, has worked as a foreign agent, representing the Georgian government and a political party in Moldova in the U.S. President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, answering a question from a Russian delegate at the Munich Security Conference said the evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election “is now incontrovertible.”“The Mueller indictment permanently demolishes the idea that the scale of the Russian campaign was not significant enough to have any impact on the American public. We are no longer talking about approximately $100,000 (paid in rubles, no less) of advertising grudgingly disclosed by Facebook, but tens of millions of dollars spent over several years to build a broad, sophisticated system that can influence American opinion,” McKew wrote for Wired.com.";http://www.apnews.com/966d5d2cbb614e4c9da8e6200505c9f6,http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=943,http://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380504/The-Special-Counsel-s-Indictment-of-the-Internet.pdf,http://www.voanews.com/a/russia-dismisses-united-states-election-meddling-indictments-as-blather/4259206.html,http://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/unofficial-transcript/0914%20The%20Scourge%20of%20Russian%20Disinformation%20-%20FINAL%20UNOFFICIAL.pdf,https://efile.fara.gov/pls/apex/f?p=171:200:15714435956023::NO:RP,200:P200_REG_NUMBER:6132,http://www.politico.eu/article/h-r-mcmaster-incontrovertible-evidence-of-russian-interference-in-election,http://www.wired.com/story/did-russia-affect-the-2016-election-its-now-undeniable/;Russian Foreign Minister Calls Mueller Indictment 'Blabber,' Experts call it 'Absolutely Damning';;;;;;

Polygraph.info has obtained audio recordings from a source close to the Kremlin who said the Russian casualties were personnel from a private Russian military company who attempted to capture an oil refinery in Syria.“So, one squadron f**** lost 200 people…right away,” said one of three mercenary soldiers. “Another one lost 10 people… and I don’t know about the third squadron but it got torn up pretty badly, too.”Most news reports cite similar casualty figures.The incident took place on the night of February 7-8, a week before Zakharova’s briefing in Moscow.The U.S. said its forces acted in self-defense – in response to an offensive by what were assumed to be pro-Assad forces. “We will use force if our troops are threatened, and that was the case,” said State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert.Commenting on the incident, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said: “It was self-defense. Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war.”U.S. military officials said the coalition was in contact with Russia before, during and after the February 7-8 attack and had alerted Russia to the presence of SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) personnel in that area.Mattis said the Russians had told the American military that they did not have any forces there.“Via the administration of the president of Russia and the Defense Ministry, explanations were quickly given concerning the absence of Russian troops near the American air strike,” Zakharova told reporters.Zakharova’s claims about the number of people killed in the incident and their citizenship contradict Western and the Russian media reports.Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny called Zakharova’s statement a “lie.”“It is hard to imagine that it would take such a long time” for the Russian Foreign Ministry to establish the citizenship of those wounded, Navalny said, especially given that “the injured had been transported back to Russia.”Russia has its own military bases in various locations in Syria, and the Russian military and government are closely cooperating with Bashar Assad and his armed forces.Various media have identified at least eight Russian citizens whose relatives and friends confirmed that they were killed in Syria's Deir el-Zour on the night of February 7- 8.Here is the list, compiled from several outlets, including Novayagazeta.ru, Fontanka.ru, Rferl.org and others:Alexey Shikhov, from the city of Nizhny NovgorodRuslan Gavrilov, from the village of Kedrovka, Sverdlov regionStanislav Matveyev, from the town of Asbest, Sverdlov regionIgor Kosoturov, from the town of Asbest, Sverdlov regionAlexey Ladygin, from the city of RyazanKirill Ananiyev, from MoscowVladimir Logonov, from KaliningradVladimir aka “Apostol,” last name unknownAnother prominent Russian opposition figure, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is running against Vladimir Putin in the March 2018 presidential elections, sent an open letter to the Kremlin and the military demanding the truth about what happened in Syria on the night of February 7-8.“I demand an explanation of why Russian citizens are taking part in ground military operations in Syria, despite the statements made by the president and the defense minister about the withdrawal of Russian military forces from that country, and that the civil war in Syria was over,” Yavlinsky wrote.The Russian independent news outlet Znak.com reported that “217 Russian mercenaries” were killed in the incident, while Bloomberg.com, citing Russian military sources, said about 300 Russians were killed.On February 11, Polygraph.info acquired three separate audio recordings from a source close to Kremlin, who claimed the people speaking on the recordings are personnel from “CHVK Wagner,” and the audio-clips are recorded phone conversations. CHVK is the Russian abbreviation for “Private Military Company.”The man on the longest audio clip, speaking Russian with a Moscow accent, detailed what he said was “our failed attack” against a U.S.-held oil refinery in Deir el-Zour on the night of February 7-8.EmbedshareAudio recordings and transcriptions of conversations of CHVK Wagner paramilitary personnel involved in a clash with the U.S. military in Syria.

It is unclear how many of the scores said to have been killed in the incident were citizens of countries other than Russia.Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia during the Obama administration, told Bloomberg.com: ""Any Russian mercenaries, whether they are in Ukraine or Syria, work for the Russian government."" Below is an English transcript of the audio recordings and the actual audio clips in Russian with English captions:  The first audio clip:“The reports that are on TV about … well, you know, about Syria and the 25 people that are wounded there from the Syrian f*** Army and -- well ... to make it short, we’ve had our asses f*** kicked.

378;;;;Misleading;Oleg Deripaska’s legal representative;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/deripaska-rybka-navalny-prikhodko/6741752.html;Deripaska’s Lawyer: Navalny is Not the Defendant in the Suit;2018-02-15;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Alexey Navalny’s video investigating ties between Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko, which was published on the website of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and posted on YouTube, was viewed nearly five million times in just one week.The video is also the target of two lawsuits -- one filed by Deripaska, the other by Navalny. As the immediate result of Deripaska's lawsuit, Roskomnadzor, Russia’s communications regulator, added the postings of the video to its list of banned Web pages.Deripaska is reportedly a confidant of President Vladimir Putin, and also has ties to President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Prikhodko, widely seen as Putin’s most influential shadow foreign policy adviser, is also the chairman of Korporatsiya Takticheskoe Raketnoe Vooruzhenie – a private firm that has the largest contracts with the Russian military to develop tactical missiles and missile systems.Navalny, Russia’s most popular opposition figure, has been barred from taking part in the country’s upcoming presidential elections.Navalny’s video, which was posted on February 8, shows Deripaska and Prikhodko relaxing on the oligarch’s private yacht off the coast of Norway in August 2016. With the two men is a woman described as a “VIP escort.” At one point in the video clip, the two men discuss Russia-U.S. relations, and seem to blame Victoria Nuland, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, for the deterioration of those ties.Navalny said he found the video footage on the Instagram account and YouTube channel of the young “VIP escort,” Anastasia Vashukevich, who goes by the name Nastya Rybka. He also quoted from her book “A Journal: How to Seduce a Billionaire” – in which, according to Navalny, Rybka refers to Deripaska as “Ruslan” and Prikhodko as “Papa.”Sergei Prikhodko has not denied the authenticity of the video/photo/audio materials or any of Rybka’s claims regarding his appearance and behavior on Deripaska’s yacht. In a written statement to Russia’s RBC news outlet published on February 9, Prikhodko only spoke about Alexey Navalny, describing him as “a political loser” who “once again tried to stage a provocation and call attention to himself.”Prikhodko added that Navlany “confusingly mixed everything possible and impossible ­– from my friend (Oleg Deripaska) to the American President Trump and Manafort, who I do not know personally.”On February 10, Deripaska’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Anastasia Vashukevich (Nastya Rybka), demanding that she remove 14 Instagram posts and seven videos that violate Deripaska’s right to privacy under article 24 of the Russian Constitution.Deripaska’s legal representatives stated that Navalny “is not a defendant in the suit.” However, several developments before and after the suit was filed suggest that while Navalny formally is not a defendant in Deripaska’s lawsuit, he might very well be the target of it.First of all, while Prikhodko told RBC that he himself would not be pursuing Navalny legally, because “it is enough that others are doing that,” Deripaska filed the lawsuit the next day.Second, after Deripaska’s legal team filed suit, Roskomnadzor immediately added Navalny’s video investigation to its official list of sites containing information not to be distributed in Russia, specifically referring to Deripaska's lawsuit as the reason.The Interfax news agency reported on February 15 that on the basis of a court ruling, Roskomnadzor was taking measures to restrict access to Web sites that had posted personal information about persons mentioned in Navalny’s video investigation.""Roskomnadzor received a ruling of Ust-Labinsk district court [in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region] on interim measures on the claim,” Interfax quoted an unnamed source in Roskomnadzor’s press service as saying. “The court decision obligates Roskomnadzor to take measures to restrict access to information posted on a number of Internet resources.""Roskomnadzor announced around midday on February 14 that ""nearly 30 resources"" had deleted Navalny's video from their sites.On February 15, Alexey Navalny said Roskomnadzor had blocked access to his website in Russia. At the time of this publication, https://navalny.com could not be accessed on Polygraph.info's computers in Washington, DC.Third, the photographs and videos in question had been publicly available on Rybka’s Instagram account and her YouTube channel at least for two years, but Deripaska never before complained that they violated his privacy. It is possible he did not know they existed, but Rybka claims the two kept in touch after the yacht incident.Navalny’s producer Oxana Baulina said they have received a warning from YouTube and Google Russia offices ordering them to remove Navalny’s video-investigation.Navalny has filed an appeal with Moscow’s Taganka district court against Roskomnadzor. demanding that it remove his investigation from the list of the banned materials.Finally, Deripaska’s legal team has cited Article 24 of the Russian Constitution, which states: “Collecting, storing, using and distribution of information about the private life of individual without their consent is prohibited.”There is, however, an exception – if the individual in question is a government official and the information is vital to the public interest. The “government” exception would apply to Prikhodko. It is up to interpretation whether the “public interest” exception would include Deripaska, who is known to be close to Putin and whose companies do business with the Russian Federation.One particularly notorious use of this exception occurred in March 1999, when state-controlled Russian television aired a video showing, in its words, “a man resembling” then Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov, in bed with two prostitutes. Skuratov had been investigating charges of corruption against then President Boris Yeltsin.Skuratov resigned after the then director of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Vladimir Putin, confirmed that Skuratov was indeed the man featured in the video.It is widely assumed that Russia’s intelligence services secretly arranged the filming of Skuratov in bed with the prostitutes in order to use the footage as “kompromat” – compromising material – against him.";http://www.interfax.ru/russia/599352,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/business/dealbook/russia-ipo-putin-deripaska.html,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/24/manaforts-russia-connection-what-you-need-to-know-about-oleg-deripaska/?utm_term=.5597e71f1b8,http://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/5320211Z:RU-korporatsiya-takticheskoe-raketnoe-vooruzhenie-oao,http://www.instagram.com/nastya_rybka.ru/?hl=en,http://www.rbc.ru/politics/09/02/2018/5a7dc6479a7947a4be81bebb,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-12/sexy-graft-video-may-lead-russia-to-block-instagram-youtube,http://www.interfax.ru/russia/599352,http://www.interfax.ru/russia/599948,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-election-navalny/russian-opposition-leader-navalnys-website-blocked-before-election-idUSKCN1FZ16Z?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FworldNews+%28Reuters+World+News%29,https://navalny.com,http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2018/02/13/750794-navalnii-sud-roskomnadzor,http://www.zakonrf.info/konstitucia/24/,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kremlin-sex-lies-and-videotape/,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFvR93X5nOg;Deripaska’s Lawyer: Navalny is Not the Defendant in the Suit;;;;;;
379;;;;Misleading;Gianni Infantino;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/soccer-football-world-cup2018-russia-fifa/6741741.html;FIFA President Praises Russia for Doing “Everything for Fans” – Which Includes Forced Labor and Mass Killing of Stray Dogs;2018-02-01;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Top officials of the International Federation of Football [Soccer] Association, or FIFA, have praised Russia’s preparations for hosting the 2018 World Cup this coming summer. FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, appeared in a promotional video, saying he is expecting a “great atmosphere” for games in Russia – where, he said, “everything is done for the fans.”In December, President Vladimir Putin welcomed world soccer stars to the Kremlin for the 2018 World Cup final draw ceremony. “Our country intends to hold it at the highest level,” Putin said.There are, however, issues overshadowing the idyllic picture drawn by Infantino and Putin. Even as Russian preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia continue, the ""great atmosphere” is tarnished by ongoing and new scandal. CorruptionWith new allegations reported publicly this week, the United States Justice Department last month issued new grand jury subpoenas in an investigation of FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the U.S. Olympic Commitee. The newest probe touches Russia's involvement in the Olympics. Among the specific sports marketing companies that prosecutors are scrutinizing is Helios Partners, a firm that has lobbied global sports officials to award high-profile events to particular cities and countries. Helios helped Russia secure the 2014 Winter Olympics and the coming 2018 World Cup, before its acquisition in 2012 by the Amaury Group, a French media company. According to the Russian opposition party Yabloko, Russia has spent 212.5 billion rubles ($ 3.5 billion) on the construction or reconstruction of the eleven main arenas for the World Cup -- “almost 100 billion rubles [$1.6 billion] greater” than what other governments would have spent to do the same thing. The Russian government has not released a list of the general contractors for these jobs, but it certainly consists “almost entirely of the friends and comrades in arms of Putin,” said Yabloko leader Sergey Mitrokhin. The difference between what the construction should have cost and what it did cost, he added, “almost certainly has ended up corruptly in their pockets.”Accusations of Russia’s involvement in large-scale corruption surrounding soccer have been piling up since the U.S. indicted 14 top FIFA officials “who had corrupted the sport through two decades of shadowy dealing and $150 million in bribes.”World -- An Interpol red notice for two FIFA officials and four corporate executivesFollowing the U.S. indictments, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland opened a criminal investigation into how Russia was selected to host the 2018 World Cup. The investigation also includes the selection of Qatar for the 2022 competition.The 2018 World Cup in Russia, as well as the next three competitions, is itself the target of yet another ongoing criminal probe – into an alleged a corruption scheme involving the allocation of media rights.CheatingThe International Olympic Committee investigated mass doping schemes in Russian sports. As a result of that probe, Russia’s team was banned from participating in next month’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchan, South Korea; 43 Russian athletes were disqualified from participating in Olympic events, while 13 were stripped of their Sochi Olympics’ medals [Russia, 2014]; and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, the country’s former sports minister, was banned from the Olympics for life.Mutko headed the 2018 World Cup organizing committee until stepping down last month due to the international pressure against FIFA.However, Mutko’s “retirement” from soccer seems a mere formality: on January 24, a month after his “resignation” from the 2018 World Cup organizing committee, he announced that the World Cup infrastructure “must be ready” by April 1.Thursday, the Louisiana based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) -- Sport's highest tribunal, overturned the IOC ruling and reinstated the Sochi Olympics results for 28 Russian athletes, saying it had found insufficient evidence they were guilty of anti-doping violations in Sochi. Eleven others were confirmed by CAS to have committed doping violations.However, CAS said its mandate was ""not to determine generally whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples … but was strictly limited to dealing with 39 individual cases and to assess the evidence applicable to each athlete on an individual basis.""Killing the StraysIn preparation for the World Cup, the Russian government has dedicated millions to “eliminating the public health threat” of stray animals.According to the Facebook group @BloodyFIFA2018, stray dogs are being brutally killed in all 11 of the Russian cities set to host World Cup games.Russia -- In St. Petersburg, Kazan, Moscow Pickets against the killing of stray dogs.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports that 6,000-8,000 rubles (roughly $107-$142) are being paid for each dog corpse is and dog extermination service companies are winning lucrative government contracts.The situation is not without precedent: Thousands of stray animals were killed as part of the preparations for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.Worker ExploitationIn 2015, Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations human rights investigator for North Korea, launched a probe into the “slave-like” conditions for thousands of North Koreans working abroad, “mainly in China, Russia and the Middle East.”The investigation found that North Korean workers were building stadiums in Russia for the 2018 World Cup. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called these allegations “fake,” and a Western plot aimed at “scaring off” foreign football fans.Fan violenceThe European soccer authority, UEFA, suspended Russia’s soccer team from Euro 2016 championships after Russian hooligans fought rival fans in the streets of host cities in France.Vladimir Putin used the slang verb “otmetelit,” – roughly translated as “beat the hell out of” -- in commenting on the violence in France.

According to the ministry, the Russian fighter jet approached at a “safe distance” and the flight “was performed in strict compliance with international rule[s] of airspace use.”According to independent experts, none of these statements is true or accurate.U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said, in a written statement, The Russian fighter jet closed “to within five feet and crossing directly in front of” the U.S. aircraft.The European Leadership Network [ELN] a London-based policy group focusing on defense and security issues, monitors encounters between the armed forces of NATO and its partners, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other, since March 2014.According to the ELN report “Russia – West Dangerous Brinkmanship,” 66 incidents identifiable from public sources took place between March 2014 and March 2015.The Dangerous Brinkmanship report details three “high risk,” 13 “serious” and 50 “near-routine” incidents during that period.The author of the ELN report, British security expert Thomas Frear, @FrearUK disagrees with the Russian Defense Ministry’s categorization of the January 29 incident over the Black Sea.Frear told Polygraph.info the encounter was “serious” and the Russian aircraft behaved “aggressively” and “outside of routine.”“I would classify this incident as ‘Serious’ under the criteria developed for the Brinkmanship report, as it is an aggressive action outside of routine behavior, but based on currently available information did not pose a high risk of escalation,” Frear said in an email to Polygraph.info.The Brinkmanship Report provides the following criteria for the “Serious” category: “Serious incidents go beyond the previously established pattern of interaction and involve close encounters of a more aggressive and unusually provocative nature.”Frear’s assessment accords with those of the Pentagon and the State Department.""This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the Su-27 closing to within five feet and crossing directly through the EP-3’s flight path, causing the EP-3 to fly through the Su-27’s jet wash. The duration of the intercept lasted two hours and 40 minutes,"" the U.S. Naval Forces 6th Fleet Commander said in a statement.“The Russian side was flagrantly violating existing agreements and international law, in this case the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA),” said Nauert, the State Department spokesperson. ""The United States notes with the highest level of concern the latest incident of unsafe Russian military practices.”U.S. Naval Forces Europe called the incident “an unsafe interaction with a U.S. EP-3 in international airspace.”Nauert said this was just “the latest example of Russian military activities disregarding international norms and agreements.” She added: “We call on Russia to cease these unsafe actions that increase the risk of miscalculation, danger to aircrew on both sides, and midair collisions.”TASS reported the Russian Defense Ministry said the Russian jet followed the U.S. aircraft to “prevent it from violating Russia’s airspace borders…”However, the U.S. Naval Forces 6th Fleet Commander said, ""The U.S. aircraft was operating in accordance with international law and did not provoke this Russian activity.""The Pentagon repeated the assertion and pointed to the protocols the U.S. Navy strictly follows: Office of the Chief of the Naval Operations’ Instruction 5711.96C, which prohibits American personnel from engaging in any acts that could create a potentially dangerous incident, including harassment and aggressive behavior.";http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ELN-Russia-West-Full-List-of-Incidents.pdf,http://www.c6f.navy.mil/news/us-ep-3-intercepted-black-sea,http://tass.com/defense/987456,http://www.c6f.navy.mil/news/us-ep-3-intercepted-black-sea,http://https://fas.org/irp/doddir/navy/opnavinst/5711_96c.pdf;Russia claims Fighter Jet Behaved in “Strict Compliance” with International Rule;;;;;;

Along with the photograph, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson shared the story of how she had been standing in a hotel lobby when an American woman complimented her style, calling her “an iconic Manhattan dweller.”Several Russian government media outlets, including RT, boosted Zakharova’s Facebook post, and the official Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in the U.S. joined the chorus, with a tweet concluding with her response to the New York woman: ""I hate to ruin your dream, but I am Russian.”The original Facebook post triggered a tsunami of criticism from Zakharova's Russian followers.There was a debate online on where she was standing – certainly not at or in a hotel. Zakharova was on 67th street in the tony Upper East Side, outside the Russian Mission to the U.N. and less than four blocks from New York’s Central Park. ​Thousands questioned Zakharova’s “patriotism” for wearing a foreign made outfit, asking her how she could afford such luxury items on a government salary.While Zakharova responded to some of the criticism, she ignored the questions about her salary – which could be a separate fact check. Zakharova is the only head of a Russian Foreign Ministry department who does not publicly disclose her income.Fur certainly might strain the budget of a government employee, even at a senior level. A check of the U.S. online trading site, Ebay.com, reveals a full length leopard print on goat fur would cost 450,000 ₽. An Ocelot fur jacket was more reasonable, 140,000 ₽. In an apparent show of support for domestic products, Zakharova said that her outfit in the photo was Russian (except for the bag – “Italian” -- and the sunglasses – “possibly Chinese”).She said her shoes were made by Vitacci – an Italian company with Russian connections. Yet her pumps are not among the 63 styles on the company’s Web site. Maybe an older style?It was Zakharova’s fur coat that drew the most attention, both on Facebook and on Twitter. The ""official face of Russian diplomacy,” as she is known, seems very fond of genuine fur coats. Indeed, on Instagram, she is seen wearing what looks like a genuine mink/silver fox fur coat. On Facebook, the government employee also models a genuine fox fur coat.Zakharova says her ""iconic Manhattan” style leopard-pattern fur coat came from the “expo Ladya,” held in Moscow last month. But Ladya’s “Winter Fairytale” expo was dedicated to Russian traditional crafts and arts. Only three artisan businesses presented their traditional fur and leather craft items, and none of them produces luxury furs made with a leopard-skin pattern. The press service of the Ladya National Crafts Exhibition at the World Trade Center in Moscow did not respond to a Polygraph.info inquiry about the participants in the December 2017 event.A related discussion on social media was whether Zakharova’s coat was made of genuine fur and, if so, from which animal?Many Facebook followers guessed that the coat was made of genuine leopard fur. However, one man on Twitter responded to a Russian Consulate tweet by saying the coat was “made of 25 Ocelots.”Polygraph.info attempted to ask Zakharova on Facebook about the origins of her coat, but its question was marked as spam less than three minutes after it was posted.The Foreign Ministry’s press office has not responded to Polygraph.info’s multiple inquiries related to the issue.​Maria Zakharova's Leopard-Pattern Fur Coat: Polygraph.info Questions Unable to Post on Facebook (screenshot)Polygraph.info sent Zakharova’s Facebook photograph (with her face obscured) to four experts on big cats. They all responded that they could not determine whether the coat was made out of genuine skin without touching it.“It appears to be an ocelot coat pattern,” said William Swanson, director of animal research at the Cincinnati Zoo, who could not confirm whether the coat is made of real fur. “But I suspect it is real because the rosette pattern is so variable in the coat like you would see with combining pelts from different ocelots (fake fur is more likely to repeat the same patterns over and over),” he said.Maria Zakharova's Leopard-Pattern Fur Coat: Genuine Ocelot coat sold on Ebay (Screenshot)The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is a United Nations body with 183 member countries that regulates international trade in species of fauna and flora to ensure it does not pose a threat to the survival of listed species.Maria Zakharova's Leopard-Pattern Fur Coat - CITIES APPENDIX 1 Screenshot“I don’t know why anyone would still be wearing a real coat like this – since it carries a social stigma these days - but there is no predicting propriety in people anymore,” said Swanson, the zoo animal research director.";https://russian.rt.com/world/news/471630-zaharova-manhetten-amerikanka,http://declarator.org/office/view-file/46638/,https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tom-Ford-Goat-Fur-Coat-Black-Cheetah-Print-Lambskin-Lined-NWT-12500-SIZE-36/162869382219?hash=item25ebc58c4b:g:7tIAAOSwJWFaaXIV,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%82%BD,https://www.ebay.com/itm/Real-fur-coat-or-jacket-ocelot-ozelot-print-new/122928047447?hash=item1c9f152557:g:TKQAAOSwZ3BaZkAh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%82%BD,https://vitacci.ru/catalog/zhenshchinam/obuv/tufli/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215726486024836&set=a.4365446944032.176170.1523648416&type=3&theater,http://nkhp.ru/promyislyi/hudozhestvennaya-obrabotka-meha-i-kozhi/,https://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php;Maria Zakharova Claims To Wear a Completely Made-in-Russia Outfit;;;;;;

The Istagram account Kadyrov lost as seen before it was deletedResponding to the decision of the Western social media platforms to close his accounts, Kadyrov said he was happy with the actions of “Instagram and their bosses in the White House.” He also announced that he is switching to the “Chechen” network called Mylistory, which is “as good as foreign ones,” and to which “State Department employees can access only with the permission of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the government of Chechen Republic.”Telegram Channel, Ramzan Kadyrov: ""State Department Employees allowed only with Russian Foreign Ministry permission.Facebook explained that Kadyrov’s accounts were deleted in accordance with the company’s legal obligations after the U.S. sanctioned him for human rights violations.The Chechen government’s Grozny TV channel dedicated dozens of reports to Mylistory, praising the app as #18 in the App store top charts.Russia’s Ministry of North Caucasus Affairs called on all federal agencies to create accounts with Mylistory, indicating that Russia might see the app as having a larger role than simply a Chechen social network and will seek to boost it to the same popularity as vKontakte – Russia’s Facebook analog.“Russia might be testing social media strategy similar to China’s: Rather than dealing with Western platforms, they’ve simply created an alternate universe where there’s a Chinese clone for every platform,” a social media expert told Polygraph.info Interestingly, President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev created official accounts with Mylistory immediately after Kadyrov did.Mylistory, Russian President Vladimir Putin's ProfileMylistory: The Kremlin's official account follows only one other user and that is Ramzan KadyrovMylistory: Russia's PM Dmitry Medvedev created an account shortly after Kadyrov did.Kadyrov’s own accounts – both in Russian and English - look less attractive in terms of content, and have far fewer followers than the Instagram account he lost.

Its popularity is “not propaganda,” Vzglyad wrote, adding that many users have expressed gratitude to the app’s developers to Kadyrov for supporting it.“It’s pretty much Instagram with fewer features, right down to a rip-off of Instagram’s old golden logo and font. It has basic functionality like the ability to post photos, comment and send direct messages, though there’s no way to share content on the site externally, and the app lacks features like ‘Stories,’” American Gizmodo.com wrote.Polygraph.info tested the Mylistory application, from the process of downloading it from the App store to creating an account and digging into the developer’s IP address.Mylistory is definitely not #18 in App store’s top charts of free social networking apps. It is not even close to being in the top 50.The Web site mylistory.com listed in the apps’ page in App store as “App Support” opens only from unsecured connections and leads to the page, which states that it is “under development.” When attempting to open mylistory.com from secured connections, the page was blocked as a security risk.Mylistory.com does not pass security filtersThe developer of Mylistory, according to its page in App store, is a Chechen man named Magomed Eskhanov. In the Russia’s online database of registered businesses, he is listed asCEO of the Advertising firm “Myli,” at this address: 3/25 A. Kadyrov Ave, Grozny, Chechen Republic.According to the database, Eskhanov’s agency is 100% funded by the LLC “Grozny-Citi” a company owned by one of Chechnya’s most notorious businessmen -- Movsadi Alviev, a co-founder of the “Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation,” named after Ramzan’s late father (who was the republic’s ruler from October 2003 until his assassination in May 2004) and ranked as #5 on Transparency International’s list of “9 grand corruption cases.”Reportedly, the “Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation” is Ramzan’s personal tool for appropriating and laundering of billions of rubles.But the most interesting part of Mylistory’s “developer Magomed Eskhanov” story is the IP address of mylistory.com: a search of the database of RIPE, the Amsterdam-based Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia, leads not to Chechnya, but to a whole network of “dead ends” – hidden IPs “located” at different addresses in Moscow, including a 24-hour auto parts store and several P.O.

If Mayor Muriel Bowser approves the bill, it will go into effect.This means that there are still several legal procedural steps before/if the street signs near Russian embassy will change from Wisconsin Ave to Boris Nemtsov Plaza.Embassy of Russian Federation, 2650 Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest, Washington DC.However, leading Russian politicians are already responding to the news from Washington, DC with a flow of accusatory comments.Nemtsov’s former colleagues in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, have proposed renaming the street on which the U.S. embassy is located in Moscow. They are calling for changing the current address, “8 Bolshoi Devyatinskiy Pereulok,” to “1 Severoamericansky Tupik,” which translates to 1 North American Blind Alley.One top lawmaker said it was “immoral” for the Americans to attempt “pit the current Russian authorities against Boris Nemtsov.”And Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma’s foreign affairs committee, called the DC city council’s move “interference in Russia’s internal affairs.”That Novikov’s claim is false was proven by his own boss, Duma foreign affairs committee chairman Leonid Slutsky, who called the DC city council’s decision“rough” and “brutal,” but added that “it is the American government’s business.”Likewise, Russia’s Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said late last month concerning the Council of the District of Colombia’s plans to rename the street in front of the Russian embassy in the U.S. capital: “The American authorities decide where, when and in whose honor they name a particular plaza, a particular street.” Riot police encircle Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, Moscow, February 2014.Explaining why she co-sponsored renaming on Russian Embassy’s doorstep, DC city council member Mary Cheh, said, “there is little doubt that his (Nemtsov’s) murder was motivated by his political beliefs, his popularity, and his frequent and open criticism of the Russian government.”;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-unaccountable-death-of-boris-nemtsov,http://lims.dccouncil.us/Download/39108/B22-0539-CommitteeReport1.pdf,http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B22-0539?FromSearchResults=true,http://ria.ru/politics/20180110/1512370412.html,http://ria.ru/world/20180110/1512356981.html?inj=1,http://ria.ru/world/20180110/1512345740.html,http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2017/12/30/n_10999652.shtml,http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-us-embassy-name-changed-nemtsov-plaza/28966776.html;“Rough…Brutal… Immoral...

384;;;;False;Ivan Karyakin;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/us-lng-eu-russia-gazprom/6741715.html;RT: U.S. LNG Reduces Europe’s Energy Security;2018-01-09;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in late October described the U.S. export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European Union as a “political step” motivated by “Russophobe hysteria” and aimed at “preventing the Russia-EU relations from normalization,” as well as an “unfriendly” act that will “undermine Europe’s energy security.”Moscow also claims that U.S. sanctions against Russia are part of a struggle for domination of the EU energy market. As reported by the Russian government-funded broadcaster RT, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the U.S. sanctions back in September, said that the U.S. was seeking to “bury” Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and “force-feed” its own LNG to Europe.Russian media coverage of the issue generally has a similar spin. In a recent example, RT’s website posted an analysis headlined: “How long can Europe survive without Russian gas?”The RT piece cited a report by Italy’s La Stampa newspaper, but misrepresented it. The La Stampa piece examined possible scenarios and consequences “if new supply problems arise from Russia,” noting that such “blockade crises” occurred in the past, when Gazprom, Russia’s giant natural gas monopoly, left entire countries without gas for a week during bitterly cold winter weather.However, the thrust of the La Stampa piece was contrary to RT’s claim that “replacing the Russian pipeline gas with American LNG does not increase, but reduces the energy security of the EU.”What does “energy security” actually mean?The International Energy Agency (IEA), the Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization consisting of 29 member countries, defines energy security as “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price.”In supplying gas to Europe, Russia has clearly not provided for “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price.” Indeed, it has repeatedly failed to provide for an “uninterrupted availability of supplies” to its European clients, not because of accidents or other circumstances beyond its control, but because it intentionally cut off or significantly reduced gas supplies to Europe in the dead of winter, leaving millions without heat.Russia has dominated the European energy market for nearly two decades, supplying the continent with more than 34 percent of its entire gas consumption. During that time, European governments repeatedly accused Russia of systematically abusing its dominant position in the market and using the EU’s dependency on Russian gas supplies as leverage against those Moscow considered political rivals.Based on these accusations, the European Commission in 2012 initiated an anti-trust case against Gazprom. In announcing the investigation’s preliminary findings in April 2014, the Commission accused Gazprom of “unfair practices,” saying the Russian gas monopoly “had used its commanding position in the region to demand high prices and restrict its captive customers' ability to secure supplies from other sources.” Belgium -- EU Commissioner for Energy, German Guenther Oettinger gives a press conference on the Gas stress test at the EU commission headquarters in Brussels, October 16, 2014Meanwhile, 38 European countries, including all of those in the EU, carried out energy security stress tests in 2014. They simulated two energy supply disruption scenarios for a period of one or six months: a complete halt of Russian gas imports to the EU and a disruption of Russian gas imports through the Ukrainian transit route.Still, the Russian government and Gazprom’s management continue to insist that Russia is “one of the world’s most reliable” suppliers – a claim Polygraph.info previously investigated and debunked. But is U.S. LNG export really “replacing” Russia on the EU market, and is it “reducing” European energy security? According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. exported LNG to Europe in 2017, with three shipments to Portugal, two to Lithuania and Italy and one each to the United Kingdom, Poland and Netherlands. All the shipments totaled 33,915 MMcf (million standard cubic feet), which is less than one percent of Europe’s gas consumption.The European Union estimates that LNG from providers including the U.S., Norway, United Arab Emirates and Russia could represent 25% of the total EU gas supplies by 2030.This means, however, that even from a long-term perspective, the U.S. will not become a dominant trader in the EU energy market even if demand for American LNG increases significantly. The “Roadmap of the EU-Russia Energy Cooperation until 2050” plan demonstrates that, despite all the problems, Russia will remain one of Europe’s main natural gas suppliers.Russia’s projected long-term domination of the European energy market is most likely due to the fact that five major EU companies have been investing in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is 100 percent owned by Gazprom. Austria’s OMV, France’s Engie, Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall, and Anglo-Dutch Shell together invested 1.43 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in Nord Stream 2 in 2017, and committed to fund up to 10% each of the project's total estimated cost of 9.5 billion euros ($11.2 billion), if needed.Therefore, RT’s claim about U.S. LNG “replacing” Russian gas in Europe is exaggerated, if not false.Contrary to RT’s claim, the U.S. entry into the EU energy market is helping to provide energy security as defined by the IEA, experts say. “The U.S. LNG is the price setter driving down Gazprom prices,” Anders Aslund, a Senior Fellow in Global Business and Economics at the Atlantic Council, told Polygraph.info.Former Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, currently a Senior Fellow in Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution, called RT’s claim “definitely not accurate.”“The more suppliers you have to choose from the more stable and secure is your position as a consumer. Normally, competition leads to lower prices. I do not understand why the European gas market should be different,” Aleksashenko told Polygraph.info.According to U.S. government data from 2011, the most expensive natural gas on the international market at that time was from Japan and Russia.In response to Lithuania’s decision at the end of 2014 to import U.S. LNG, Gazprom offered a 23% discount on pipeline gas supplies. This was evidence that the arrival of U.S. natural gas in the European market is lowering prices, particularly given that Russia does not want to give up its market share. Russia has also recently discounted supplies to Ukraine in an attempt to make its gas exports competitive now that Kyiv can import gas from the West.The U.S.'s stated goal in entering the EU energy market is to provide Europeans with alternative energy supplies.In a speech in Warsaw on July 6, U.S. President Donald Trump said: “We are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy.” Speaking at a Warsaw press conference ahead of the G20 summit meeting, Trump stated: ""Let me be clear about one crucial point. The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You don't want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation.""";http://tass.ru/politika/4689937,https://www.rt.com/business/404105-nord-stream2-europe-us-medvedev/,https://www.rt.com/business/413375-russia-gas-europe-lng-dependence/,http://www.lastampa.it/2017/12/13/italia/cronache/in-caso-di-stop-dei-rifornimenti-russi-riserve-per-giorni-poi-i-razionamenti-TOIrWTsbdwdX4d9L2n5UyI/pagina.html,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7826142.stm,https://www.iea.org/topics/energysecurity/,http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07gazprom.html?pagewanted=all,http://www.dw.com/en/freezing-europe-feels-russian-gas-shortage/a-15725079,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-01/putin-s-russia-seen-dominating-european-energy-for-two-decades,http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/gazprom-in-central-and-eastern-europe-a-long-history-of-exploitation/,https://www.rferl.org/a/gazprom-antitrust-eu-russia-case/26972199.html,http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-gazprom-european-union-competition-20150422-story.html,https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/energy-security-strategy,https://www.polygraph.info/a/gazprom-russia-eu-antitrust-investigation/28523245.html,https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_MOVE_EXPC_S1_M.htm,http://www.eurogas.org/uploads/media/Statistics_Eurogas_long_term_outlook_to_2030_-_16.11.07_01.pdf,https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/2013_03_eu_russia_roadmap_2050_signed.pdf,http://blogs.platts.com/2017/11/01/ec-russia-nord-stream-2-gas-link/,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/pat-robertson/us-liquefied-natural-gas-game-changer-russia-europ/,https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/workshop/pdf/Session1_Jensen.pdf,https://www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/insightanalysis/industrysolutionpapers/sr-us-lng-pipeline-gas-european-market-share.pdf,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-people-poland/,http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/trump-natural-gas-europe-leaders.html?view=story&%24DEVICE%24=native-android-mobile;RT: U.S. LNG Reduces Europe’s Energy Security;;;;;;

The Russian president again declared victory over ISIS and said in a statement to the servicemembers, ""I order the defense minister and the head of the General Staff to begin the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces to their permanent places of deployment.”Radio Free Europe reported that Putin met at the Khmeimim base with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, here Russia’s president said that together the Russian and Syrian forces had ""crushed the most combat-capable international terrorist group.""SYRIA -- Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Syrian President Bashar Assad watch the troops marching at the Hmeimim military base in Latakia Province, December 11, 2017""In light of this, I have made a decision: a significant portion of the Russian military contingent in [Syria] is returning home, to Russia,"" Putin said.On December 6, Russia’s government-backed news agency, Interfax, reported that Vladimir Putin announced in a statement the liberation of Syria of all Islamic State (IS) terrorists declaring the country “completely free” of the terrorist grip of IS.Interfax’s report was widely re-tweeted and quoted in the Russian media space. Most mentions came from government-owned media TV channel like Vesti, Zvezda, Channel One, and others.RT repeatedly broadcasted Putin’s announcement mentioning it first in a report of the U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson’s statement about the importance of Syrian leader Bashar Assad’s direct involvement in peace talks. Putin was quoted in the last paragraph of RT’s story and said the emphasis in Syria now should be on drafting a new constitution and future elections.On Thursday, December 7, Sergei Rudskoi, the head of the Russian General Staff, officially confirmed Putin’s statement in a press briefing on Thursday, December 7.EmbedshareRussia's Top Gen.

The Pentagon, in an official release of the new U.S. troop’s numbers in Iraq and Syria from December 6, 2017, estimated the militant group has been driven out of 97 percent of the territory it once held. There are currently around 2,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Syria who will remain there to guarantee an “enduring defeat” to IS, a Pentagon spokesperson told AFP.""We are going to maintain our commitment on the ground as long as we need to, to support our partners and prevent the return of terrorist groups,"" Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said.He denied that Russia and the Syrian regime were responsible for meaningful progress against IS and attributed success to the United States-led coalition.Earlier this month the U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis spoke about a shift in Pentagon’s posture in Syria to reflect the collapse of IS. By December, the major combat operation to retake Raqqa was over.Pentagon officials say American troops will help with the restoration of basic services, allowing the safe distribution of humanitarian aid and helping to disable explosive devices left as the terror group fled its strongholds.Despite Putin’s announcement on Monday at the Khmeimim military base, Russia is not withdrawing its troops from Syria either. Sergei Rudskoi said on December 6 that the Russian military would focus on humanitarian support of the Syrian people.On December 5, the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke at a bilateral meeting with the European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini about the EU ­­--U.S. shared objectives for IS. He did not confirm the complete defeat of the terrorist group, however Tillerson said, it is “coming to an end.”“Our shared objectives in terms of defeating ISIS are important, but not just defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but defeating ISIS globally and I think continuing our discussion on joint efforts to combat terrorism wherever it raises its head. And we certainly see the result of ISIS’ caliphate and its long reign of terror that they have carried out in Iraq and Syria, which is now coming to an end,” said Tillerson.IS territorial losses over 2017 have been substantial.Islamic State losses in 2017 drawn on an unclassified map published by the U.S. Department of Defense​The Pentagon released an unclassified map, showing in the third quarter of 2017, IS lost a stronghold near Kirkuk in northeast Iraq, and in Syria - a pocket of fighters near Hamah in the west and sporadic areas of influence around Dayr az Zawr.The U.S. and coalition had been providing information about the prospects for defeat of IS since past summer.In early November 2017, Jane’s 360 -- a defense analysis think tank – published a report that cited a 70 percent drop in operations against IS by the coalition forces.On November 7, Brigadier General Andrew Croft, the deputy air commander of the coalition’s land component, said “That’s indicative of the fact that ISIS [the Islamic State] is collapsing, not only as a physical caliphate, but also in ownership of land.”“They only now control about 4 or 5 percent of the original area they covered. So the number of targets has dropped dramatically, particularly in the last month,” he added.Abrahms agrees: “There is no measure in which ISIS is doing well in Syria. It is doing poorly compared to how it was doing 6 months ago and one year ago. ISIS is weakened.”The Islamic State, which had emerged from what remained of Al Qaida in Iraq more than a decade ago had “faded into obscurity for several years,” said the Wilson Center in a 2016 report. The militant group reemerged in 2011 amid the chaos and instability of the Syrian Civil War, overrunning parts of Iraq in 2014.While the number of foreign fighters who joined IS from Europe, Russia, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has shrunk, the Pentagon spokesperson, Pahon stated on December 7 that there are still more than 3,000 IS fighters between Syria and Iraq and much work has to be done to prevent the resurgence of IS. In 2014, ISIS controlled more than 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, from the Mediterranean coast to south of Baghdad. At the end of 2016, ISIS territory had shrunk to about 23,320 square miles.IS' so-called ""caliphate"" shrunk 16 percent in the first nine months of 2016 and 14 percent in 2015.IHS Conflict Monitor service’s map of ISIS-controlled territory in 2015In 2015, following Assad’s formal request for assistance, Russian military forces joined the fight against IS. The officially confirmed by the Russian government main part of Russia’s military campaign in Syria ran for almost six months, from September 30, 2015 to March 14, 2016.Russia and the U.S. reached an agreement on coordinating efforts in the fight against IS in September 2016 after 10 months of failed attempts to halt the fighting.After 5 weeks of negotiations, the two countries agreed to create a Joint Implementation Center, where they shared targeting data and coordinated bombing of militants of the Nusra Front and the Islamic State.Both the U.S. and Russia have indicated the need for a post-war political process in Syria. In late October, the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura discuss a future political process in Syria. In early November, Vladimir Putin called for stabilization and laid out the conditions for a political process in Syria.";https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-syria-surprise-visit-partial-withdrawal/28909593.html,http://www.interfax.ru/world/590727,https://www.rt.com/news/412196-syria-peace-talks-tillerson-assad/),https://av.voanews.com/Videoroot/Pangeavideo/2017/12/b/b4/b4625e03-f6be-4f79-a0ea-07c5ded20679_mobile.mp4,/a/putin-syria-free-of-isis-fact-checked/6740842.html,https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740842.html,https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.polygraph.info%2fa%2f6740842.html&text=Russia%27s+Top+Gen.+Sergei+Rudskoi+Announces+Liberation+of+Syria+from+IS,/a/6740842.html,/embed/player/Article/6740842.html?type=video&FullScreenMode=True,https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-revises-troop-numbers-syria-iraq/4152157.html,https://www.voanews.com/a/mattis-signals-military-shift-to-reflect-is-defeat/4146308.html,https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/12/276255.htm,https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-rise-and-spread-the-islamic-state,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-10-26/tillerson-expects-good-discussion-as-he-meets-un-syria-envoy,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-putin-trump/putin-urges-political-solution-in-syria-in-calls-to-trump-mideast-leaders-idUKKBN1DL0GJ;Russian President Says All Islamic State Military Units in Syria “Destroyed”;;;;;;

Part I;2017-11-16;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;"RT-America, the U.S. branch of the Russian international broadcasting conglomerate, registered as a foreign agent under FARA on November 10, fulfilling the demand from U.S. Department of Justice.RT operates in the U.S. behind a so-called “shell company,” registered in Washington, DC on April 2, 2014, as “T&R Production.” The registration form says T&R Production is a limited liability company “wholly owned” by its sole member and general manager Mikhail V. Solodovnikov, with a $670,000 annual salary.Under the “foreign principal” section in FARA T&R Production chose, out of three options -- government of foreign country; foreign political party; foreign or domestic organization -- the third option, naming ANO TV-Novosti as its foreign principal and describing it as an “NGO registered under Russian Federation law.”The company’s profile in Russia’s Federal Taxation Service database says ANO TV-Novosti registered in April 2005 as an Autonomous Nonprofit Organization, with the same address in Moscow as listed on RT’s FARA form: 111020 Borovaya St. 3.Two people are named as fully authorized to act on behalf of ANO TV-Novosti. One is a man unknown to the public named Alexey Lvovich Nikolov – the CEO and a deputy chief editor. His name was added to the registration on April 14, 2017. The second name is familiar to many: RT’s chief editor Margarita Simonovna Simonyan, who, according to the document, is chief editor of RT’s “foreign principal” ANO TV-Novosti as well.The registration of ANO TV-Novosti with Russia's federal taxation agency.According to Russia’s Federal Taxation Service, ANO TV-Novosti’s registrant and founder is the Federal state unitary enterprise/Russian international information agency “RIA Novosti” – a media corporation listed in the database of Russia’s Federal Agency for State Property Management as “property of the Government of the Russian Federation.”RIA Novosti itself was registered by two government agencies – the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications and the Federal Agency for State Property Management – each of which also owns 50 percent of the company. Under the leadership of the well-known TV host Dmitry Kiselyov, RIA Novosti is in a process of transformation into a new media conglomerate, “MIA Rossia Segodnya,” which includes Russia’s other international broadcaster, Sputnik.Russia -- (L-R) Rossiya Segodnya general director Dmitry Kiselyov, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rossyia Segodnya editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, meet at the Rossiya Segodnya news agency, Moscow, June 7, 2016According to the open database of Russian federal government contracts, from the time it was registered in April 2005, ANO TV-Novosti had at least eight government contracts, totaling 216,439,922 rubles (approximately $7.79 million according to April 2005 exchange rates). These included a contract with the Federal state budgetary educational institution of higher learning “The Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.”The nature of the contracts was described as the “provision of informational services covering the activities of government entities.”Russian news agencies are expected to reflect a positive image of the Russian government. In April 2017, the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications presented its 2016 annual report to President Vladimir Putin.Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communication 2016 annual report.The report says that the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications “exercised the functions of a state client in financing, controlling and supervising the subordinate entities” in accordance with the president’s address to the Russian Federation Council, in which Putin underlined “main directions of the information policy.”These “directions” included “propagating and promoting the formulation of Russia’s positive image globally.”On page 12, the report provides details from the budget of the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications dedicated to government-owned media in 2016.It reads: “ANO TV-Novosti” – 17,517,636.300 rubles”(around $293,577). With additional mention of an unspecified increase of its “federal budget” in 2017 due to a creation of a French language channel under Russian Federation government decree #1385 of December 12, 2016.Media reports indicate a more significant direct financial funding of RT from the Russian Government over the course of 12 years since RT's establishment in 2005.In 2005, ANO ""TV-Novosti"" invested $30 million in start-up costs to establish RT, with a budget of $30 million for its first year of operation.In December 2008, the Russian Government included ANO ""TV-Novosti"" on the list of core organizations of strategic importance.RT's annual budget increased from approximately $80 million in 2007 to $380 million in 2011, but was reduced to $300 million in 2012.In October 2012, when the Russian Finance Ministry attempted to reduce funding for Russia Today once again, President Vladimir Putin responded with an executive order forbidding the budget reduction.In 2014 RT received 11.87 billion rubles ($310 million) in government funding and 15.38 billion rubles ($400 million) in 2015. RT's government funded budget for 2016 was 19 billion rubles ($307 million).The U.S. Department of Justice had given RT until Monday, November 14 to register as a foreign agent or face legal action. RT opposed the requirement and the Committee to Protect Journalists called it “a bad idea…a shift in how the law has been applied in recent decades.The Russian Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, Tuesday, November 15 unanimously approved legislation allowing the government to force foreign media organizations operating in Russia to register as “foreign agents.”The Russian Justice Ministry followed up with letters to nine media outlets, warning they might be forced to register. Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, as well as the program Current Time and Polygraph’s partner fact check Factograph also were warned.“The Voice of America is an independent news source required by law to be accurate, objective and comprehensive,” said VOA Director Amanda Bennett.

Immediately, both sides of the dispute declared victory.“The European Court of Human rights (ECHR) has refused to recognize the embezzlement case against Russian activists Aleksey and Oleg Navalny as politically-motivated,” RT, the Russian government-funded broadcaster, reported the same day the verdict was made public.The Russian Justice Ministry said in a statement that the “inadmissibility” of the Navalny brothers claim of politically motivated prosecution was “so obvious” to the ECHR that the court did not even consider investigating it.“We have won. Thank you to all for your support,” Alexey Navalny tweeted, with a link to his blog posting on the court decision. It is possible for two opposing sides in a court case to perceive a verdict as a victory, but such cases usually involve some kind of a compromise, unlike in this case. Thus, it appears that one side was not completely accurate in claiming victory over the other.Here are the facts from the ECHR’s press release:“In today’s Chamber judgment in the case of Navalnyye v. Russia (application no. 101/15) the European Court of Human Rights held, unanimously, that there had been: a violation of Article 7 (no punishment without law) of the European Convention on Human Rights and a violation of Article 6 § 1 (right to a fair trial).”In regard to fines and compensation, the ECHR ruled that:“Russia was to pay to each applicant 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of nonpecuniary damage; furthermore, it was to pay, in respect of costs and expenses, EUR 45,000 to Aleksey Navalnyy, and EUR 10,971 and 460,000 Russian roubles to Oleg Navalnyy.”“That’s a strong result in any court,” said Christopher Swift, a professor of National Securities Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, referring to the Navalny brother’s victory on two out of three claims.The ECHR failed to act on the allegation that the Navalny prosecution was politically motivated, a provision of the convention the European court rarely invokes in cases involving Russia – not since 2004.While RT included some of the key details about the two violations in its report, the Justice Ministry ignored them completely. It hinted in its statement that Russia “might consider” appealing the ECHR ruling, which raises the question of ­why anyone would appeal a verdict if it was a victory.The Justice Ministry’s sole focus on the one claim it denied “mischaracterizes its implications,” said Swift, who also practices international law at a Washington, DC firm. He told Polygraph.info that the Navalny brothers “were deprived of their right to a fair trial and punished unfairly” by Russia.In December 2014, the Russian court convicted the prominent Russian opposition leader and aspiring presidential nominee Alexey Navalny, along with his brother Oleg Navalny, of fraud. Many view that verdict as politically motivated.The Navalny brothers filed a complaint with the ECRH in January 2015.Swift noted the brothers’ appeal did not circumvent Russian law. “They’re pursuing the last appeal available to them in a forum that the Russian Government accepted when it signed the Convention,” Swift concluded.";https://www.rt.com/politics/406966-european-human-rights-court-sees/,http://minjust.ru/ru/novosti/evropeyskiy-sud-po-pravam-cheloveka-ne-ustanovil-politicheskogo-presledovaniya-v-ugolovnom,https://navalny.com/p/5583/,https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press,http://www.voanews.com/a/eu-us-russian-opposition-condemn-alexei-navalny-oleg-verdict-putin/2579980.html,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-navalny-echr/russian-opposition-leaders-fraud-conviction-arbitrary-europes-top-rights-court-says-idUSKBN1CM1D7;Navalny vs. Russian Federation – and the winner is…;;;;;;
388;;;;False;Irina Alksnis;;;polygraph;;https://www.polygraph.info/a/us-browder-visa-interpol-russia-fact-check/6741678.html;RIA Novosti: U.S. ‘Betrayed’ William Browder;2017-10-24;polygraph;Fatima Tlis;On October 23, William Browder, the American-born British businessman and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin who is leading the international campaign for the Global Magnitsky Act, announced on Twitter that Russia had put his name on the Interpol’s most wanted list. A short time later, Browder tweeted that the U.S. had “simultaneously” revoked his entry visa. The Russian media practically exploded with triumphant headlines. The government-owned news agency RIA Novosti posted a total of seven articles on the topic in a single day, including a caricature of Browder with the caption “Siberia is calling.”Speaking at the annual Valdai Club meeting in Sochi several days earlier, on October 19, Putin stated that the Ziff Brothers Investments LLC, which has invested with Browder, is “funding the Democratic Party, [and] the Republican [Party] in a much smaller volume.” Putin added: “They protect themselves that way.”The Russian president also said that the Magnitsky Act is used to whip up “yet another anti-Russian hysteria.”The Magnitsky Act is the U.S. law adopted in 2012 that imposed sanctions on Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, the Russian lawyer who worked for Browder before dying in a Moscow prison in 2009. The law is also used to impose sanctions on those responsible for other human rights abuses in Russia.Two days after Putin's Valdai Club statement, on October 21, Russian media reported that Moscow had added Browder to Interpol’s most wanted list, triggering a Red Notice for his arrest.Following reports of the U.S. visa revocation, Russian political analyst Irina Alsknis wrote in an op-ed for RIA Novosti that “the U.S. has betrayed Browder,” describing him as a “pawn who imagined himself a queen.”Interpol, an international police organization with 192 member countries, describes its role as seeking “to enable police around the world to work together to make the world a safer place.”Russia is a member of Interpol, with a Central Bureau in Moscow and 80 regional divisions across the country.According to Article 1 (8) of the Interpol’s Rules on the Processing of Data, Russia, as a nation with a designated Interpol Central Bureau, is authorized to “directly provide data for processing purposes” in Interpol’s global system.The Interpol system is organized in such a way that immediately after a person’s data is added to the wanted list, the “Red Notice” goes out to all Interpol member states, activating security procedures, including revocation of any existing visas.Contrary to the Russian claims of a “U.S. betrayal,” the news that Browder’s U.S. visa had been revoked triggered a storm of statements from the top American politicians demanding that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security immediately rectify the issue.“Bill Browder is a champion of anti-corruption in #Russia. DHS must immediately review decision to revoke his visa,” Senator John McCain wrote on Twitter. That same day, October 23, Senators John McCain and Ben Cardin issued a joint statement.“We understand that William Browder’s U.S. visa has been revoked due his inclusion on the Interpol list,” the statement read. “According to Browder, the Russian government has submitted his name for inclusion on the Interpol list on several occasions in the past, yet it was rejected as politically motivated. And through these episodes, his U.S. visa status has been immediately reinstated. The Department of Homeland Security should expedite an immediate review of the decision to revoke Mr. Browder’s visa.”In a statement, the U.S. State Department indicated Browder’s eligibility to travel to the country falls under the Visa Waiver Program. The government said Browder’s application was made under the “Electronic System for Travel Authorization,” (ESTA). The U.S. DHS stated that when confronted with possible derogatory information, it conducts a “manual” review of the ESTA application.“William Browder’s ESTA remains valid for travel to the United States,” DHS wrote. “His ESTA was manually approved by CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) on Oct. 18—clearing him for travel to the United States.” That is one day after media reports indicate Russia asked Interpol to put out a “Red Notice” on Browder.“GREAT NEWS! My ESTA (US visa waiver) was restored. I successfully checked into a US flight. Now we need to fix bogus Interpol arrest warrant,” Browder tweeted from London on October 23.
