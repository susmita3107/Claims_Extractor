He married his husband, Destenay, two years later in 2015, The Guardian reported. Despite the image’s claim, it does not show Bettel and Destenay. A reverse image search revealed it features Wurst, an Austrian musician and drag queen, and Karsai, Wurst’s business manager. The photo, captured at the 2019 Vienna Opera Ball by photographer Jeff Mangione, was later published in a Kurier article. Similar pictures of Wurst and Karsai at the event can be seen on their respective Instagram pages. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Justin Trudeau In A Tigger Costume?)

Her selection marked the first time a female in the country had been nominated as a deputy presidential or presidential candidate, according to the outlet. In the video, which first appeared on TikTok May 30, Michelle Obama and American artist Amy Sherald pull down a curtain to apparently reveal a portrait of Karua. The June Facebook post’s caption says the unveiling took place “at a Women’s Conference in the U.S.” (RELATED: Did Michelle Obama Surrender Her Law License Because Of Insurance Fraud?) The video is digitally altered. A reverse image search found that the footage stems from a ceremony by the Smithsonian Institute in 2018 for the unveiling of Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama’s official portraits.   While both Michelle and Barack Obama’s official portraits are in the museum, no such portrait of Karua exists in the Smithsonian’s  National Portrait Gallery nor do any of the paintings on Sherald’s website feature her. There are likewise no news reports suggesting the Smithsonian or any organization has unveiled a picture of her during any conference. This is not the first time Karua has been the subject of misinformation online.

Fact Check: Tubman, who was born into slavery, is well known for helping other enslaved people escape to freedom along the Underground Railroad route, according to Britannica. She conducted approximately 13 trips along the route over the span of a decade beginning in 1850, the encyclopedia states. if(""object"" == typeof window.freestar){ var obReadMoreDiv = document.getElementById('ob-read-more-selector'); var fsDiv = document.createElement('div'); fsDiv.setAttribute(""data-freestar-ad"", ""__336x280""); fsDiv.setAttribute(""align"", ""center""); fsDiv.id = ""dailycaller_incontent_3""; var fsScript = document.createElement('script'); fsScript.setAttribute(""data-cfasync"", ""false""); fsScript.setAttribute(""type"", ""text/javascript""); fsScript.innerHTML = ""freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: 'dailycaller_incontent_3', slotId: 'dailycaller_incontent_3' })""; fsDiv.appendChild(fsScript); obReadMoreDiv.appendChild(fsDiv); }  if(""object"" != typeof window.freestar){ var obReadMoreDiv = document.getElementById('ob-read-more-selector'); var obReadMoreDivChild = document.createElement('div'); obReadMoreDivChild.id = ""/10519169/dailycaller_inline2""; obReadMoreDivChild.classList.add(""ad""); obReadMoreDiv.appendChild(obReadMoreDivChild); }   An image shared on Facebook claims to show a black and white photo of her holding a rifle. “Do you think Harriet Tubman could’ve passed a govt background check in 1850s Maryland?” reads text included in the image. The photo does not show Tubman. A reverse image search reveals it actually shows Fields, known commonly as “Stagecoach Mary.” The photo appears on the National Park Service website and the Smithsonian National Park Museum website, both of which identify the woman as Fields. Britannica also includes the photo in its entry about Fields and attributes it to the Ursuline Sisters of Toledo, Ohio. Sister Joy Gray, who is part of the leadership team of the organization, confirmed in an email to Check Your Fact that the woman in the picture is Fields, not Tubman. (RELATED: Did Harriet Tubman Say She Could Have Freed More Slaves ‘If Only They Knew They Were Slaves’?) Fields, who was born into slavery and later became a housekeeper of the Toledo Ursuline Convent, is remembered best for becoming the first black woman to be a star route mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, according to Britannica. She carried a rifle and a revolver on her route to fend off potential thieves, History.com reported.  While the woman in the photo is not of Tubman, she also carried a pistol during her emancipation trips and a rifle during the Civil War, according to harriettubmanbiography.com, a website run by Tubman biographer Kate Clifford Larson.  share on facebook tweet this show comments Elias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The alleged quote appears to be an alteration of a statement he did make about guns in a 1998 interview with The New York Times. Fact Check: Osbourne is an English singer and songwriter who first rose to prominence in the 1970s, according to Britannica. An image shared on Facebook claims to show a statement he made in support of gun rights. if(""object"" == typeof window.freestar){ var obReadMoreDiv = document.getElementById('ob-read-more-selector'); var fsDiv = document.createElement('div'); fsDiv.setAttribute(""data-freestar-ad"", ""__336x280""); fsDiv.setAttribute(""align"", ""center""); fsDiv.id = ""dailycaller_incontent_3""; var fsScript = document.createElement('script'); fsScript.setAttribute(""data-cfasync"", ""false""); fsScript.setAttribute(""type"", ""text/javascript""); fsScript.innerHTML = ""freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: 'dailycaller_incontent_3', slotId: 'dailycaller_incontent_3' })""; fsDiv.appendChild(fsScript); obReadMoreDiv.appendChild(fsDiv); }  if(""object"" != typeof window.freestar){ var obReadMoreDiv = document.getElementById('ob-read-more-selector'); var obReadMoreDivChild = document.createElement('div'); obReadMoreDivChild.id = ""/10519169/dailycaller_inline2""; obReadMoreDivChild.classList.add(""ad""); obReadMoreDiv.appendChild(obReadMoreDivChild); }   The image shows a photo of Osbourne along with a quote attributed to him that reads, “If guns kill people, why do we send people with guns when they go to war? Why not just send the guns?” The purported statement began circulating on social media in the wake of a series of mass shootings in the U.S., including a May 14 shooting at a Buffalo supermarket and a May 24 shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. There is, however, no record of Osbourne making this statement. It does not appear on any of his verified social media accounts nor on his website. Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to corroborate the authenticity of the alleged quote. The quote appears to be an altered version of a real comment he made in a 1998 interview with The New York Times. When asked about “the recent epidemic of violent youth” he responded by saying, in part, “America doesn’t need as many guns! I keep hearing this [expletive] thing that guns don’t kill people, but people kill people. If that’s the case, why do we give people guns when they go to war? Why not just send the people?”  Notably, this quote is structurally similar to the quote featured in the Facebook post but appears to be suggesting the opposite claim.

He recently survived a vote of no-confidence from parliament over the issue, The Associated Press reported. The Facebook image, which has garnered over 50 reactions, appears to show Harry Styles wearing a t-shirt that reads, “ALL TORIES ARE C***S.” The post’s caption states, “Correct Harry.” The term “Tory” is a British term for a member of the country’s Conservative party, according to Merriam-Webster. The party seeks to “include the promotion of private property and enterprise, the maintenance of a strong military, and the preservation of traditional cultural values and institutions,” Britannica states. The photo is digitally altered. A reverse image search revealed the photo first appeared in November 2014 in an article for Irish Mirror, showing Styles leaving the Nice Guy Club in Hollywood, California. (RELATED: Did Arnold Schwarzenegger Wear This Pro-Ukrainian T-Shirt?)  The image also appeared in articles published by the Daily Mail and Just Jared. None of the images taken during that night show Styles wearing anything with political messaging. Though Styles is not often vocal about his political beliefs, he previously criticized Brexit in 2017 and proclaimed he was “probably going to vote for whoever is against Brexit,” according to NME. He also retweeted a promotional video for President Biden’s presidential campaign back in 2020 with the caption, “If I could vote in America, I’d vote with kindness.” This is not the first time a political message has been digitally superimposed onto a celebrity’s shirt.
