But the other three photos are mischaracterized by the meme: One was not taken in the U.S., another was taken before Biden became president and a third was taken outside of the U.S. and before Biden’s presidency.    The meme was originally posted June 19 by a Twitter account that regularly shares content making fun of Biden. It showed four photos, each with text overlaying it.   ""Your stores,"" the text said over a photo of a supermarket with empty shelves.   ""Your cities,"" the text said over a photo of tents popped up along a street.   ""Your borders,"" the text said over a photo of migrants lining a fence at the southern U.S. border.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  But aside from the November 2021 photo of Biden with his family, none of the pictures highlighted in the meme depict the U.S. under Biden’s presidency, according to reverse image searches.  The photo of empty shelves at ""your stores"" was actually taken at a supermarket in London in March 2020, before Biden took office and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The photo of the encampment in ""your cities"" was actually a photo of a makeshift migrant camp in Tijuana, Mexico, just across the border from San Diego. It was captured in March 2021.  The photo of migrants at ""your borders"" was actually snapped in March 2019, before Biden became president, south of the border fence in El Paso, Texas.

So-called ""chemtrails"" are not real, according to atmospheric chemists and geochemists, but conspiracy theorists have used the term to describe the condensation trails that airplanes create, suggesting that they show planes are spraying the earth with chemicals. In fact, these plumes are formed by the combination of high humidity and low temperatures.  Nor is there evidence that the cattle deaths were orchestrated to cause a food shortage. And claims that heat is not to blame are also wrong.  The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has said that at least 2,000 cattle died due to high temperatures and humidity, Reuters reported. The death toll was based on requests the state agency received to help dispose of the cow carcasses.   Scarlett Hagins, a spokesperson for the Kansas Livestock Association, told the news outlet that cattle started to suffer heat stress as temperatures soared from the high 70s to 108 degrees and humidity spiked and winds died down. The cows couldn’t acclimate to the sudden change; the overnight temperatures did not enable them the time their bodies needed to cool down.  Dr. Nels Lindberg, a veterinarian who works with feedlots in Kansas, told a CBS News affiliate in the state that the cattle deaths are the result of a natural disaster.   ""Sometimes the conditions get so extreme, it doesn’t matter how hard producers prepare the environment, the operation, the animals,"" Lindberg said.   We rate these posts False.","https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce4AaZbuo7c/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=aa62d938-0b9a-424b-ab29-a3d3998a424a,https://www.facebook.com/joey.haim/videos/3264813760417383/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=397568425740345&set=a.110607861103071&type=3,https://www.politifact.com/personalities/viral-image/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/may/23/viral-image/video-game-not-combat-ukraine/,https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/13/tiktok-posts/chemtrails-are-not-real-no-matter-what-alexa-says/,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/02/facebook-posts/claim-us-government-spraying-toxic-brew-chemicals-/,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/heat-humidity-kill-least-2000-kansas-cattle-state-says-2022-06-15/,https://weather.com/news/news/2022-06-16-heat-wave-temperatures-cows-power-outages,https://www.kwch.com/2022/06/17/veterinarians-work-quash-misinformation-into-sw-kansas-cattle-deaths/","Extreme heat killed cattle, not chemtrails or a food shortage scheme","Agriculture,Weather,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts,Agriculture,Weather,Facebook Fact-checks,Facebook posts",,,,,
