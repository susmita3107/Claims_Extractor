These figures are correct. However, Verreyt carries on: “Anyone who continues to argue that migration is necessary to provide our labor market with workers is blind.” This is a misleading statement that is rejected by multiple labor market experts, so we assess the claim as mostly false. The men behind the claim Hans Verreyt is a member of the Vlaams Belang (previously Vlaams Blok) political party in Belgium. This right wing party is nationalistic, calling for stricter immigration laws and a shift in policy to prioritize the Flemish population, according to the party’s official website. “The party stands up for the preservation of cultural individuality and for the identity of its own people and therefore against multicultural ideas,” the website’s “Statement of Principle” section reads. As a figurehead of the party, Verreyt defends and embodies these ideas. Verreyt was part of nationalistic youth and student organizations until he began working for Vlaams Belang as a parliamentary assistant, according to his Wikipedia page. In 2019, he was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives as a Member of Parliament for the Antwerp electoral district. Louis Lippens and Stijn Baert are the authors of the inactivity report used by Verreyt. Lippens is currently a PhD researcher at Gent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, focusing on labor economics and sociology of labor. His current research surrounds hiring discrimination and he has extensive experience in labor management, according to his LinkedIn profile. Baert is also currently a PhD researcher and professor at Gent University. Baert’s research is focused on labor economics and he has received a lot of recognition for his research, according to his professional profile on Gent University’s website. Both men hold doctoral degrees in labor economics. Analysis of the inactivity report According to doctors Lippens and Baert, they conducted this study in an attempt to respond to the Belgian government’s desire to increase the employment rate through policy changes. The paper breaks down Belgium’s labor force into three categories of workers: employed, unemployed, and inactive. In order to increase the employment rate, they concluded that the country needs to activate the inactives (unemployed who aren’t actively looking for work) because they form a much larger subgroup than the unemployed. The report lists that the data they used is from Eurostat, the official statistical office of Europe. It is a heavily relied on resource and is trusted by European countries and researchers. These authors do not have any biases that we could find that would affect the outcome of their research paper. The trend behind Verreyt’s claim In our research, we found ample data that supports Verreyt’s first claim. A large number of non-EU foreigners in Belgium are inactive. Data and figures from StatBel, the official statistical database for Belgium, supported the inactivity report and subsequently, Verreyt’s first claim. However, we talked to multiple experts in immigration and employment that refuted his second claim.  Lippens, Baert, and several other economists published a follow-up research paper. This paper clarified many questions and data points about inactives in Belgium. Lippens said that the total number of non-EU inactives only make up 9.4% of the total inactives in Belgium. There are 1,086,800 inactive Belgians and 123,000 inactive non-EU foreigners. He noted the problem is not solely a problem regarding non-EU immigrants as Verreyt leads people to believe, it is a problem Belgium is facing as a whole. Jeroen Franssen, a labor market expert working for Agoria, stressed that right now there is a surplus of jobs but a lack of people looking for employment. Data from Trading Economics, a website providing data for economic indicators in 196 countries, along with Lippens and Baert’s research supports Franssen’s claims. Job vacancies in Belgium are at an all-time high now with 196,140 jobs available as of April 2022. By 2030, Belgium aspires to have an 80% employment rate. However, there will be a predicted 5.4 million jobs available but only 5.1 million people looking for work. Belgium will either need to activate inactive people or use resources outside Belgium. Franssen thus concluded that immigrants are necessary for the Belgian labor market to work, stating immigrants will be 10-15% of the solution, contrary to what Verreyt stated. Understanding why immigrants are inactive To understand what’s meant by “inactives,” Franssen listed two main categories: those who have enough comfort to not need to work anymore, and those who don’t have the comfort to even think about getting a job. The second category could consist of someone who has a long-term illness, who needs to take care of their family, or who needs to finish their education.  Fons Leroy, labor market expert and policy maker, and Franssen both stressed that non-EU immigrants face many obstacles due to their different cultural backgrounds. Many immigrant women prioritize their family so they are “active”– just not on the formal labor market. Each source we talked to noted a persistent negative mindset that some Belgian employers have toward people of a foreign background. This, combined with the fact that some employers don’t recognize other educations, makes it harder for immigrants to become active in the workforce. This shows that there is a logical reason why these immigrants are inactive, differing from what Verreyt is leading people to believe. Leroy commented that many available jobs have a low quality of work. In that case, people with a different skill set or those without a full education (42.6% of non-EU foreigners don’t have a secondary school degree according to Lippens and Baert’s follow-up report) are needed to replace those who wouldn’t take those jobs. He went on to say that Belgium should stimulate upward mobility in the workplace by ensuring that every talent has the opportunity to have success and those with lower skills are able to evolve. By becoming more inclusive and flexible for everyone, the Belgian labor market will be able to function at its highest potential, Leroy explained.  Conclusion When quoting numbers, Verreyt is correct. We found three recent and reliable studies that provide figures supporting the numbers in the claim. However, Verreyt uses the data in a misleading way. When assessing why he would misinterpret the data, one key factor to keep in mind is that he is a well-known representative of a political party with certain anti-immigration values. Three prominent experts in the Belgian labor market contested his last sentence “Anyone who continues to argue that migration is necessary to provide our labor market with workers is blind“ and provided information as to why he is incorrect. Therefore, we assess his claim as mostly false.

1,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-russia-abandons-international-space-station-it-could-fall-on-europe/,Russia abandons International Space Station,2022-06-21,eufactcheck,,"This fact check examines the origin and authenticity of the statement “Russia abandons International Space Station: It could fall on Europe!“, made on April 3rd in an article published by the Spanish daily sport newspaper Marca. The article says that Russia has ended its cooperation with Western countries regarding the International Space Station and allows it to crash into Earth. The claim turns out to be mostly true but misleading. The entire article is based on statements made by Russian space chief Dmitry Rogozin in Twitter posts, which were found to have been quoted correctly after translation into English from Russian. What makes us question the veracity of the statements is the fact that they sound very extreme and categorical, and their consequences would be of very broad societal significance. Moreover, the article offers a generalized one-sided view, lacking a justification of the facts as well as information that would be relevant for a good understanding of the overall situation. Marca does not cite its primary sources – this applies to both the textual information and the attached image. In addition, the author of the article is introduced only by his first name, which further reinforced our doubts. This fact check therefore examines the authenticity of the following statements. Statement 1 The first sentence of the article states that Russia has already completed its cooperation with the International Space Station. The claim that Russia has withdrawn from the International Space Station sounds like a fact that has already happened. We followed the data to Dmitry Rogozin’s Twitter account, which reads as follows: “In the context of the announced sanctions, Roscosmos will reconsider its priorities and focus on achieving full independence from the import of space equipment. The main design, technological and financial resources released by joint ventures with the US and the EU.” In the course of the analysis of the article, we found a publication from the American daily newspaper New York Times, which expresses an opinion on the termination of cooperation between Russia and Western countries regarding the International Space Station. According to it, this is yet to happen as a proposal from the head of the Russian Space Agency. In his statements on social networks, Dmitry Rogozin did not specify when exactly he would like Russia to end its participation in the ISS. For its part, Roscosmos’ main partners, NASA, say the agreement between NASA, Russia and other countries participating in the space station program is valid until 2024. But the United States is seeking to extend this period until 2030. Katie Luders, associate NASA’s space operations administrator said recently that discussions were ongoing. NASA is also working on other agreements with Russia. Ms Luders said NASA was still awaiting a review of an agreement from Russia that would allow some Russian astronauts to ride on future US rockets, and some NASA astronauts would continue to launch with Russia’s Soyuz rocket. While Russia’s intentions are real, we have found no information confirming a final refusal of cooperation. Statement 2 The article’s statement with the most important and public meaning is that the International Space Station could plunge towards Earth. According to the American technology news website The Verge, there is some truth in Rogozin’s words. NASA does rely on Russian propulsion to help control the International Space Station’s attitude, or position and orientation in space, and periodically boost the station on its orbit around Earth. While the ISS is in orbit, Earth’s gravity gradually pulls it toward the atmosphere, so the space station typically uses a propulsion module – which is controlled by Russia – to keep it in place. Without these regular boosts, though, the ISS would very slowly fall toward the atmosphere, where it would mostly burnup. “If the Russians walk away, then you’ve got this massive object that’s going to come back in randomly somewhere over the Earth.” Wayne Hale, former program manager of NASA’s Space Shuttle and a member of NASA’s Advisory Council, tells The Verge. However, such a scenario would take quite a while to manifest, possibly giving NASA some time to devise an alternate solution. “It’s not like a week, it’ll probably be several years”, says Hale. Moreover, the Russians heavily rely on NASA to keep the space station active, too. NASA also helps to control the space station’s position in orbit, and the space agency is solely responsible for generating electricity for the entire vehicle. When it comes to the ISS, the NASA and Roscosmos relationship is a symbiotic one, and either party leaving would spell trouble. Without Russia, NASA would have to engineer a new solution to help keep the station on the right path in space, so that the vehicle does not slowly fall out of orbit and enter Earth’s atmosphere. Based on our research and general attitudes, we can say that Rogozin is known for his bombastic statements which is also highlighted in an article in Space, a specialist media outlet for exploration, innovation and astronomy news that strives for maximum objective coverage: “the Russian space chief is a blustery figure with a history of hyperbolic statements”. What’s more, regarding Vox’s article, destroying the space station isn’t necessarily to Russia’s advantage, either. Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, may not want to take the risk of an uncontrolled deorbit, even if the ISS doesn’t normally travel over much of Russia. And then there’s the fact that Roscosmos also depends on NASA, and has a long history of working with the US, even through periods of tension. This is the nature of the ISS’s founding partnership, which is now more than two decades old. Statement 3 The article also claims that an American astronaut and two Russian astronauts landed safely in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after leaving the space station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule. We found the statement to be true after looking at various sources that prove its authenticity. The main source was a recording of a video broadcast live by NASA, which was published by the Reuters news agency on March 30, 2022. The video shows that an American astronaut and two Russian astronauts are successfully returning home from the International Space Station. Conclusion In conclusion, we would say that the statements in the article are mostly true, although their original sources are not cited clearly and in sufficient detail. To verify the facts, we referred to numerous sources, and the primary source of information is the publication from Space.com – a specialized media outlet that we believe strives for the most objective coverage of news in the field of exploration, innovation and astronomy. The main claims in the article that are so bombastic turn out to be unsubstantiated – there is a deliberate search for sensationalism, which is evident from the title itself. What makes us doubt the veracity of the information is the lack of various points of view and especially NASA’s position. Rogozin’s Twitter posts have been quoted correctly, and the additional information in the article is also correct, but as the analysis makes clear, the substance of his statements is misleading.

2,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-more-than-30-million-europeans-live-in-energy-poverty/,“More than 30 million Europeans live in energy poverty”,2022-06-16,eufactcheck,,"On the 4th of May 2022 Rasmus Andresen, a member of the European Parliament, posted a Tweet in which he claims that more than 30 million Europeans live in energy poverty. This claim turns out to be mostly false.   Tweet from Rasmus Andresen, 4th of May 2022 (screenshot) What is energy poverty? According to Marine Cornelis, an expert in energy policy and consumer rights, energy poverty is a condition in which people can’t fulfill their energy needs. They can’t heat or cool their home properly and can’t cook or store food. It is a complex issue because it is very context specific. Meaning that in developing countries the problem is usually linked to the connection to electricity. Whether in Europe for example, it is more a systemic problem that is linked to energy prices.   To which she adds: “One of the most important indicators is for example the income status. Households with low income are more likely to live in energy poverty. Another indicator is energy efficiency. When your home is not isolated well enough, you will pay a large amount of money on the energy bill to have a decent temperature inside. Other indicators are racism, gender, age, …”  Primary source It is not clear what source Rasmus Andresen bases his statement on. We have been in contact with his secretary, Judith Wedel. She managed to tell us that Mr. Andresen has the number from a speech by Ursula von der Leyen, but she couldn’t provide us with the right speech. We reached out to President von der Leyen’s team. Karen Saelens, the secretary of Kurt Vandenberghe who is the European Green Deal adviser, provided us with one of the reports von der Leyen uses in her speeches. This report of the European Commission from July 2021 states that “Energy poverty alone affects up to 34 million people in the European Union today.” This number can also be found in an earlier report of the European Commission from October 2020. It says: “With nearly 34 million Europeans unable to afford to keep their homes adequately warm in 2018, energy poverty is a major challenge for the EU.” Other studies such as the Council Of Europe Development Bank (CEB) studies from 2019 use approximately the same number. Can there be a stagnation? It seemed strange to us that the number of energy poverty in the European Union hadn’t evolved from 2018 to 2021. So, we approached energy policy expert Marine Cornelis. She told us this number has probably tripled by now. “Preliminary data suggest that about 80 million people in the EU are in energy poverty right now”, she explained. There are many reasons for this, including the pandemic and its impact on employment. Also due to rising energy prices and the war in Ukraine and therefore the Russian blackmail of gas. It’s everything put together. Mara Florina Oprea, Junior Project Officer at the Institute for European Energy and Climate Policy, is on the same page. “It is a hundred percent sure that we have been experiencing more energy poverty in the EU”, she confirms. But she could not give us an exact figure. “It’s probable that the number has tripled, but I don’t think that you can know that for certain. That’s because the definition of energy poverty is so broad”, she adds. Today’s data Why has the European Commission always used the same number in these last few years? That’s due to the unavailability of more recent data. The world was put on hold by the pandemic since 2019. Therefore, the figures haven’t been calculated or updated. Another reason is that not every country keeps track of the numbers quite as well. “Some member states of the EU seem to have a higher number of energy poverty. That’s because they chose to see the problem and they chose to acknowledge it. So there is more data available”, explains Cornelis. “It’s not because a country has good numbers, that it’s really the case. Mostly it’s just based on a lack of datasets. This makes it even harder to calculate the number of people who live in energy poverty.”   Conclusion Rasmus Andresen’s claim is mostly false. The number (more than 30 million) is correct, but it’s outdated. The number has increased since 2018 and it will keep on evolving. According to Oprea, energy poverty is not only extending to vulnerable groups anymore, but also to regular middle-class people. It’s now an increasingly large population of the EU. The European Commission is of course obliged to use data they know for certain, hence why they have been using the number of energy poverty from 2018. But it would be great if they came up with a disclaimer that said: this number isn’t accurate anymore.

3,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-only-three-people-died-in-the-construction-of-stadiums-for-the-fifa-world-cup-in-qatar/,„Only three people died in the construction of stadiums for the FIFA world cup in Qatar”,2022-06-13,eufactcheck,,"On January 26, 2022, FIFA’s president Gianni Infantino said at the European Council in Strasbourg that only three workers died in construction of football stadiums for World Cup 2022 in Qatar. He said: “When I hear today that 6,500 people died in the building of football stadiums in Qatar, it is simply not true. Because the real figures are three people who passed away.” We decided to check this claim and found that the numbers vary from report to report. Three work-related deaths Gianni Infantino’s quote where he states that only three workers died during the construction of the World Cup’s football stadiums might have been based on the Workers Welfare Progress Reports. The progress reports are from the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) in charge of planning and delivering the infrastructure required for World Cup in Qatar, and from 2014 until 2020 there were a total of six released reports. According to these, there were a total of 36 deaths of which only three were classified as work-related. Work-related deaths happened in 2016 when two people died and in 2018 when the death of one person was reported. The most notable information is that in only two out of six reports there are work-related deaths, whereas in four others there are zero work-related deaths. According to the Guardian’s investigation, which reported about 6,500 deaths, the term non-work-related has been occasionally used to describe deaths that happened on the job or at the stadium construction sites, which might as well be interpreted as work-related. Amnesty International warns of bad working conditions The global non-profit human rights organization Amnesty International conducted a study in March 2018 with 2000 workers from three biggest construction companies. Based on the study, migrant workers are not paid for months and even when they get their money it is far from what they deserve. They lack water, food and basic human needs and the reason for survival lies solely on charity handouts from local residents. Furthermore, Amnesty has found that workers still have no justice nor legal means. The projects are overseen by SC and – according to Amnesty – there have been around 20,000 workers specifically working on the stadiums and their worker rights aren’t protected, even though they should be by Workers’ Welfare Standards back from 2014. These standards are included in contracts awarded to companies working on World Cup sites and they cover issues such as ethical recruitment, timely payment of salaries, and a complete prohibition of forced labor. As previously stated, the study has shown that none of the implemented standards are respected, and workers seem to be slaves. Different media, different death tolls The death toll of 6,500 estimated by the Guardian consists of 5,927 Indian, Nepalese, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankian workers between 2011 and 2020. They received the numbers from the countries’ governments. The number of 6,500 also includes 824 Pakistani deaths between 2010 to 2020, according to Pakistan’s embassy. The embassies of Nepal and India, the countries where many migrant workers (about 50 percent according to the report by the ITUC, International Trade Union Confederation, p.14) of Qatar’s World Cup stadiums come from, state that 400 Nepalese workers died since 2010, the year Qatar officially became the host of World Cup 2022. In the article, the Guardian linked the number of 6,500 to another article from the BBC, which however analyzes another well-known number in the Qatar context, the one of 1,200 deaths. This number has first been stated in a report by the ITUC in 2013. BBC has taken their approach on working conditions from Amnesty’s above mentioned study and during the research of their own, their team has been arrested on their way to film a group of workers from Nepal due to danger to Qatar’s ‘national security’.  Altogether, the embassies counted more than 400 deaths a year until the end of 2013, which makes a total of 1,239 deaths (2010-2013) only of Nepalese and Indian workers. Conclusion The statement of Gianni Infantino seems to be true at first if you look at the Workers Welfare Report. But having other reports from different human right organizations and journalistic investigations that assume much higher numbers, makes it highly unlikely that just three people died in construction of the stadiums. We identify a significant gap between the reports, indicating that the claim of Infantino may not be true. But due to not having a direct clue or exact numbers that indicate if it is true or false, we assess the statement of Infantino as uncheckable.

One of the many protests took place in Berlin, organized by the German non-governmental organization Campact. It organized multiple protests following the invasion, but the one on the 27th of February struck out because of the high number of participants. According to Campact, more than 500.000 people took part in the demonstration that day in Berlin. The police of Berlin spoke of “a low six-figure number”. After a closer analysis, the number of participants seems to be exaggerated. The claim by Campact turns out to be false. Campact’s claim on its website, 27th of February 2022 (screenshot) The protest The first news item regarding the protest appeared the day of the invasion, the 24th of February. Campact posted a press release announcing a rally on Sunday the 27th of February at 1 pm on Straße des 17. Juni. Campact demanded the Russian government to restart negotiations and wanted to urge European leaders to take action against the invasion. Campact is a non-governmental organization in Germany with almost 700.000 followers on Facebook. According to their own website, over 2.2 million people subscribe to the newsletter. The main goal of the organization is to create political pressure through mass mobilization such as protests. However, it was not only Campact organizing the rally. It was also supported by other (smaller) organizations such as the Peace Cooperative Network and Pax Christi. According to the official website of the Capital Region Berlin, 20.000 participants were expected. On the Facebook event created by Campact only 4.000 people were said to be attending. However, not everyone is on Facebook or registers their participation through Facebook. Campact Campact mentioned on Twitter, its official website and on Instagram that 500.000 people participated. They released this number whilst the protest was still going on. EUFactcheck.eu contacted Campact to get more clarity on their claim, but received no response. Police of Berlin The police released a statement through the official website of Berlin and spoke of a “number higher than 100.000” and “a low six-digit number” in this press statement. It didn’t give an exact number, but one can assume that it ranges between 100.000 and 300.000; a significant difference from the 500.000 stated by Campact. Therefore, EUFactcheck.eu contacted the police of Berlin. It has confirmed their statement but did not provide a more exact number. Our own estimation To assess who’s right, EUFactcheck.eu decided to make its own estimation based on videos and images from the protest. According to Campact, the protestors were located in an area that stretched from Brandenburger Tor to Siegessäule, as well as in the adjacent Tiergarten park. The screenshot below is taken from a news report by the German news broadcaster Der Spiegel. The camera is located on top of Siegessäule, and at the end of the road, straight ahead, is Brandenburger Tor. What the screenshot also shows is that the protest mainly took place on the Straße des 17. Juni towards Brandenburger Tor, and didn’t stretch out onto the Spreeweg (on the left) and the Große Sternallee (on the right).  Der Spiegel. (2022, February 27): “Die russischen Mütter wollen ihre Söhne auch nicht verlieren”. Retrieved from Der Spiegel: https://www.spiegel.de/politik/demonstration-in-berlin-gegen-ukraine-krieg-mehr-als-100-000-menschen-protestieren-a-3b734464-b086-42f7-b68e-11ca967b78d5. (screenshot) However, not all protesters stayed within this space. This YouTube video shows some protestors standing still or moving towards the Straße des 17. Juni. at the other side of the Brandenburger Tor on the Pariser Platz. Another video shows protestors walking on the Unter den Linden, but they seem to be moving at a faster pace towards the area the protest takes place than the protestors who are already on the Straße des 17. Juni. So that video may conclude that the area where protestors come together starts on the Pariser Platz at the Brandenburger Tor. This can be confirmed by the screenshot below, where people can be seen standing underneath the Brandenburger Tor and on the Pariser Platz.  BZ Berlin.

Retrieved from BZ Berlin: https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/zehntausende-demonstrieren-in-berlin-gegen-putins-krieg. (screenshot) On the other end of the Straße des 17. Juni, at the Siegessäule, protesters seem to be standing on the whole roundabout surrounding the statue, as can be seen in the screenshot below.  BZ Berlin (2022, February 27): “Über 100.000 Menschen demonstrieren in Berlin gegen Putins Krieg”. Retrieved from BZ Berlin: https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/zehntausende-demonstrieren-in-berlin-gegen-putins-krieg. (screenshot). There seems to be no footage or photos that show the other side of the Straße des 17. Juni from the Siegessäule towards the Charlottenburger Tor at the other end of Tiergarten park. So EUFactcheck.eu assumes that the protesters stayed in an area that stretched from Pariser Platz to the roundabout at the Siegessäule. Footage and images also show some of the protesters stretched out into the park. This photo underneath by Greenpeace confirms that protesters stretched out into the park, but they did so near the stage on the roundabout. It’s uncertain whether attendees stretched out further into the park. But some video footage closer to the Brandenburger Tor shows that people mainly stayed on the road.  Greenpeace.

In order to make an estimation of the attendees, EUFactcheck.eu needed to calculate the total length and width of the road. This was done using the measuring tool of Google Earth, but for copyright reasons the maps below are taken from openstreetmap.org. The Straße des 17. Juni from Siegessäule to the square in front of Brandenburger Tor has a total length of almost 1,7 kilometres and has a width of more or less 38 metres. This means the road has a surface of 64.676 square metres. Data available under the Open Database License. © OpenStreetMap contributors The roundabout at the Siegessäule has a width of approximately 190 metres by 176 metres. By calculating the surface of an oval this means the area is 26.263 square meters large. However, the statue itself has a width of 27 metres by 27 metres, meaning the statue is 729 square metres large. So the total area people can be standing on this roundabout is approximately 25.534 square metres large. From photos it can be concluded that protestors were also standing on the grass around the statue, so EUFactcheck has included this in the calculations.  Data available under the Open Database License. © OpenStreetMap contributors The Pariser Platz and the square on the other side of Brandenburger Tor is approximately 15.000 square metres large.  According to these calculations the total area is 105.210 square metres large. This is not an exact number, but an estimation. The Tiergarten park also makes it more complicated to measure the exact width of the area protestors came together, as there is no clear visual image that can show how far protestors stretched out into the park. How dense was the crowd? In order to measure the crowd density, it’s important to know how fast people are moving or whether they are standing still. A crowd that moves takes up more space and is larger than a crowd that stands still. Footage near the stage at the Siegessäule shows attendees standing still. Footage from the Strasse des 17. Juni shows particpants walking, but at a very slow pace meaning the area is dense. However, there is a lot of footage that also shows open areas in the protest.  Pariser Platz (left) & Straße des 17.

This can be explained by the images taken at different times during the protest and people leaving the protest before the end of the protest. Another explanation that shouldn’t be forgotten, is that the Siegessäule and Brandenburger Tor are touristic hotspots and there is a possibility tourists got caught up in the protest without planning to do so.  Nexta. (2022, February 27). Retrieved from Nexta: https://mobile.twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1497939282161451012/photo/3 (screenshot) According to professor and crowd density expert Keith Still from the Manchester Metropolitan University, people can walk smoothly and stable when there’s one person in every square metre. If there’s more people within a square metre it is harder to take a normal step, and as a result people walk slower. By analysing this video of Der Spiegel people can be seen moving a bit slower than usual from 0:50 to 1:22. But from 0:06 to 0:31 there’s a crowd that is not moving at all.This video of an attendee standing near the Brandenburger Tor also shows a crowd moving slower than usual. Another video from public broadcaster Phoenix shows similar crowd movement near the middle of the Strasse des 17 Juni. This website from Keith Still shows visual images of what a crowd looks like when there are one to four people per square metre. According to these visual representations, we believe there were approximately two attendees per square metre at the protest in Berlin on the 27th of February 2022. This means there would have been a maximum of 210.420 protestors in the area between Pariser Platz and the Siegessäule. This number can be slightly lower as there are areas within the protest where the crowd is less dense, meaning in certain areas there are less than two attendees per square metre. The estimation of 500.000 attendees from Campact seems therefore exaggerated and very unlikely. Conclusion The claim that there were 500.000 protestors is false. Campact seems to have exaggerated the number of participants. EUfactcheck’s estimation is closer to the one of the police.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE Lukas Emmerechts and Rik Tuinstra, Thomas More University, Belgium Leave our comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

5,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-germany-will-never-fulfill-its-energy-requirements-with-only-wind-energy-and-solar-power/,„Germany will never fulfill its energy requirements with only wind energy and solar power.“,2022-05-27,eufactcheck,,"On March 26th 2022, Stephan Brandner, Deputy Federal Spokesperson of the right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), posted a press release on Instagram in which he claims that Germany will never fulfill its energy demand with only wind energy and solar power. Different studies have proven that this statement is false. In the past the AfD has often fought to reverse the energy transition and continue to support nuclear and coal-fired power stations. Their election program says: “A complete change of our energy supply to volatile “renewable” energy sources is unecological, unrealistic and therefore to be rejected.” In his press release Stephan Brandner also speaks of “a lack of base load capability.” Technologies that produce energy on a permanent basis are called base-load capable. Unlike renewable energies, fossil fuels are not dependent on sun, water or wind. However, experts are realizing that baseload capability will become less and less important in the future. The German Climate Consortium (DKK) comments: “The dark period, so the lack of energy supply due to both calm conditions and no sunshine, is a manageable risk in times of network-controlled supra-regional and trans-European energy supply. “ How much energy does Germany currently need and where does it come from? In 2020 Germany’s final energy consumption from industry, transport, households and commerce was 8341 petajoules (PJ), which is equivalent to 2316 terawatt hours (TWh). This energy came from two different sources: 943 TWh were generated by renewables, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy domestically and more than three times as much (3428 TWh) were imported from abroad. Let’s have a look at the power generation in Germany. First of all it is not only about electricity. In fact, three energy sectors must be considered altogether: Electricity, heat and mobility. In 2020 half of the energy produced domestically was generated by electricity.    In 2020 the share of renewables in net electricity generation exceeded 50 percent for the first time. Net electricity generation is the result of gross electricity generation minus the power plant’s own consumption. This amount is the actual electricity mix that comes out of the electrical outlet at home or is used to charge an electric vehicle. However, according to the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection, the three energy sectors of electricity, heat and mobility will still change quite a bit. With more and more electric cars on the streets, the electricity consumption will increase, which will also reduce the required amount of energy for mobility. Is it possible to generate the energy we need from renewable sources like wind energy and solar power? Yes. The Federal Environment Office classifies 13.8% of Germany’s land area as technically and ecologically usable for wind turbine technology. This could generate 2900 TWh per year. However, the actual potential is much lower. In reality economic conditions, beneficiary claims and low acceptance among the citizens must be taken into account. Despite these limitations, wind energy plays a central role in the energy transition in addition to solar power and other renewable energy sources. If photovoltaic systems (PV) are installed not only on rooftops, but also on agricultural land, artificial lakes, facades, parking lots, roads, noise barriers and even vehicles, there is more than enough surface area for strong expansion of PV systems. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems estimates the technical potential of PV systems at 3160 GW. The performance ratio indicates the efficiency of a photovoltaic system. The higher this value, the better the quality of the system. A different study shows that nowadays modern photovoltaic systems have a performance ratio of 80%. On average they reach full performance 910 hours per year. Multiplying the 3160 GW technical potential with the performance ratio of 80% with the full performance of 910 hours, we get a total energy production of 2300480 GWh or 2300 TWh. 3160 GW * 0,8 * 910 h = 2300480 GWh Theoretically, the combination of wind turbines and solar panels could generate a total of more than 5000 TWh of energy alone. That is more than twice as much as the final energy consumption in 2020. But realistically, would that be possible? We currently consume 550 to 580 TWh of electricity each year. The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection estimates that this consumption will increase to at least 800 to 900 TWh by 2050 because of the change of the energy sectors. This is why a major expansion of solar and wind energy is necessary. Especially wind energy is an important element. However, considering the current objections of politics, economy and the citizens, the realistic potential of wind power is much lower than in theory. Nevertheless, it is still possible to cover Germany’s entire energy consumption through renewable energy. In the study “100% Renewable Energies for Electricity and Heat in Germany”, scientists of The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems describe how a reduced energy consumption can be covered in the future. According to the scientists, four steps are necessary to reduce the energy consumption: Reduction of the heating demand of the building sector by 50% compared to 2010.Reduction of fuel consumption in industry by 30%.Switch from today’s fuel-based transportation to electricity-based transportation (50% battery and 50% hydrogen). Reduction of the non-energy electricity consumption by 30%.    This figure shows how a reduced energy consumption could be covered by renewable energies. The left diagram shows the energy consumption of the different energy sectors in TWh. The right diagram shows the energy production of the different renewable energy sources. It is shown that a reduced energy consumption can be covered entirely by renewable energies. However, most likely Germany will continue to import energy, as there are simply more affordable and more efficient locations for renewable energy outside of the country. For this reason, a well-developed energy network within Europe is necessary. Conclusion Stephan Brander did not include any references in his statement, I contacted him via abgeordnetenwatch.de and sent him the studies via e-mail but he never answered, therefore it is unknown on which information he based his claim. However, numerous studies prove that renewable energies are technically capable of covering 100% of Germany’s energy demand. In reality, there are also considerations on how the energy needs can be covered in the most efficient way. The most realistic solution is a combination of domestic energy production through solar and wind power and imports from abroad. Therefore, the statement that Germany will never fulfill its energy requirements with only wind energy and solar power, is false.

6,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-less-educated-people-are-more-likely-to-get-depressed/,Less educated people are more likely to get depressed,2022-05-19,eufactcheck,,"The German TV-Show „Hischhausens Sprechstunde“ explains in a short film during the show (beginning at 28:30 minutes) how and why someone is developing a depression. One reason, among others, being a low education. Causes and concomitant effects are difficult to separate, which is why the general scientific consensus is that social status, and thus education, is not a causal factor for mental illness, but rather a reinforcing factor. Nevertheless, there is a link between education, social status, and health. The reasons for this are outlined below. The claim turns out to be mostly true. Socioeconomic status and health As part of the nationwide health monitoring program for Germany, the Robert Koch Institute regularly conducts health surveys. A total of about 23,000 people from Germany aged 15 and older were surveyed about their state of health. The survey lasted from April 2019 to September 2020. The show’s explainer video says, “Less educated and socially disadvantaged people are more likely to develop depression“. But unlike the video explains the study does not show that a lower education is the cause of depression. Rather it states that more people from socially unprivileged backgrounds are more likely to suffer from depression than those from higher social classes. However, this phenomenon is not limited to mental illness. A lower social status is also a risk factor for physical illnesses.  In order to present an overall picture, average values were calculated for women and men as a whole. Originally, the study distinguished between gender as well as four age groups. The differences between the lower and upper education group are even more significant for women, which is partly due to the fact that women are exposed to additional stress and risk factors compared to men. These include poverty, disadvantages in the world of work and role overload (role as mother, employee, partner, etc.). This was described by the RKI in the Journal of Health Monitoring.    As can be seen in the graphic, the susceptibility to both physical and mental illness decreases with higher social status. Moreover, people of higher social status themselves rate their health as generally better than those of lower social class. About 82% of people from the upper social class rate their health as good. In the middle class, the figure is around 69%, and only around 59% of people from the lower social class say they have good general state of health. On average, the risk of getting a physical or mental illness is 7 percentage points higher if one comes from difficult social circumstances. The largest difference was found in the limitations due to health. While around 43% of people from difficult social backgrounds are restricted by their health, this figure is only around 24% in the highest social class. Reasons and risks for depression  So it is legitimate to describe a correlation between education and depression. Numerous studies, such as of the American Sociological Association or the Canadian school of nursing, document that higher education is associated with a reduced likelihood of depression. The reason therefore does not lie within the illness itself. It is more about environmental factors which are different among the social classes of our society. It’s easier for someone who has a secure income and a stable social position to lead a fulfilling life. The Maslow’s hierarchy of needs shows that right after the physiological needs come those needs that are strongly dependent on education, income and thus social status. As the explanatory video also mentions: depression never has just one cause. Dr. Urich Hegerl, CEO of the „Deutsche Depressionshilfe“, emphasizes that there are always two sides of the same coin wich have an impact on developing depression. Those are psychosocial as well as neurological factors. The former are factors such as low self-esteem, hopelessness, insecure financial situation and loss of employment Conclusion It is difficult to find out where the higher number of people with depression in less educated groups originates. However, a comparison with other diseases shows that this phenomenon cannot be due to depression per se, but reflects a structural problem. People from lower social classes generally have an increased risk of developing diseases. This is mainly due to the lower standards of living that result from lower education and thus less qualified jobs with lower incomes.

7,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-e-vehicles-are-more-efficient-than-combustion-engines/,E-vehicles are more efficient than combustion engines,2022-05-18,eufactcheck,,"The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly noticeable. In this context, the e-vehicle is gaining more and more popularity in Germany – many people expect it to have a better climate footprint than conventional combustion engines. This thinking is promoted by statements like this: “E-vehicles are three times more efficient than combustion engines”. This claim is mostly true. The quote originates from a tweet posted by Marion Tiemann, who is a Greenpeace climate activist campaigning for an ecological traffic turn and who studied Environmental Policy and Planning in Berlin. In this tweet of April 13, 2022, Tiemann hyperlinked a blog post of the German ministry of environment protection. But the original data source is a collaboration of the German think tanks Agora Verkehrswende and Öko-Institut. The way electric vehicles work makes people say that they are more efficient than conventional cars. But why is that? Figure 1: The WtT efficiency starts with the extraction of raw materials for fuel production and ends at the gas station where the customers can refuel their vehicle (data source: gmobility). To analyse the efficiency of a vehicle, experts often use the so called “Well-to-Wheel” efficiency. This calculation consists of two parts: The Well-to-Tank (WtT) and the Tank-to-Wheel (TtW) efficiency. All types of fuels can be measured in this scheme (e.g., gasoline, hydrogen or electricity). Researchers calculate the presumed CO2 emissions required to extract the raw material, process, store and transport it to the filling station. The TtW system, on the other hand, evaluates the efficiency of the vehicle itself and how much of the resources it uses to fulfil its purpose and get from A to B. This can be very different, depending on the vehicle’s technology, for example if it is a gasoline engine or an electric vehicle. The WtT and the TtW analysis summed up from the WtW analysis. E-vehicle causes less emissions while driving Through the WtW analysis, the differences in greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and the efficiency of electric vehicles, even when considering the European electricity mix and not assuming that the e-vehicles are powered with green electricity, become visible (cf. Figure 2).   Figure 2: Emission comparison of different vehicle types stated as CO2 equivalents. CO2 equivalents are a unit of measurement for standardising the climate impact of different greenhouse gases (data source: FIS) The graph reveals that the CO2 emitted on the way from the energy source to the gas pump (WtT) is even lower in case of combustion engines than it is in case of e-vehicles. In terms of TtW efficiency, the electric car therefore performs better because it does not emit any carbon dioxide due to its alternative driving technology. The electric car would win the well-to-wheel efficiency decision even clearer if the electricity came from renewable energies – then it would emit only two grams of CO2 per kilometre. The infographic is based on the European power mix.   Figure 3: The production of e-vehicles emits nearly twice as much greenhouse gas emissions as the production of gasoline engines.  Gasoline engines cause less emissions in production  Compared to gasoline powered cars, the production of e-vehicles is significantly more energy intensive due to emissions from the production of the batteries. Summed up, e-vehicles are only more environmentally friendly than conventional cars as they do not emit tailpipe emissions. However, it is true that their use causes less greenhouse gases depending on the electricity used. Assuming the German electricity mix and a progressive energy transition, an e-vehicle purchased today has 15 to 30 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions in the overall balance of production and use than a gasoline powered car.   Figure 4: The contributions of the different materials to the greenhouse gas emissions of the battery of an e-vehicle. Lifetime of the car determines its effect on climate change In future, the demand for the raw materials required for the production of battery cells will continue to increase. However, the extraction of these materials is often accompanied by environmental and social burdens. That is why raw material requirements need to be reduced, for example through innovative production technology and greater material efficiency. Increased recycling also contributes to this – many materials in a battery can be recycled at the end of its life. Therefore, looking at the total amount of resources actually consumed, the amount of gasoline used by an average gasoline engine over its lifetime is equivalent to 300 to 400 times the amount of metals consumed by a battery cell. Conclusion  In general, Marion Tiemann’s statement is correct as it refers to the well-to-wheel efficiency of electric vehicles. However, it needs to be noted that she is only referring to a small part of a bigger picture. For example, she does not consider the emissions produced by the extraction of materials for the production of electric cars, the production itself and the final disposal. In fact, the production of an average electric car produces about twice as many greenhouse gases as the production of gasoline cars does. Only the emissions saved during the use of the electric car make it less polluting in total than other vehicles in this comparison (cf. Fig. 2). Assuming that the energy policy and the expansion of renewable energies in Germany proceed as planned, it holds the opportunity to save emissions during the use of electric cars as well as during their production. Therefore, the electricity used for production and charging of the vehicles must be provided by renewable energy sources.

In his plea, Van Haga refers to the citizens who live close to the wind farms: ”… meanwhile they also know that a wind turbine is not sustainable over its entire life cycle.” According to Van Haga, both production and waste processing of windmills are not environmentally friendly. The wind turbines cannot be recycled and, according to Van Haga, it is better to opt for another alternative. This claim turns out to be mostly false. The claim made is as follows: “Windmills are not sustainable over the entire life cycle”. The claim was made by Wybren van Haga, Member of Parliament, engineer and entrepreneur. Van Haga has been active in the House of Representatives since 2017 and represents his own party: Groep Van Haga. To check the statement’s factuality, we searched for research on the different life stages of a windmill. To appoint; production, transport, usage and demolition. In addition, there are more potential factors that can be taken into account. One of them is nuisance. This can occur due to cast shadow, noise and horizon pollution. In addition, windmills have an effect on the local ecosystem and its animals. For this factcheck we consulted research and articles by Milieu Centraal and TU Wageningen (hereafter TUW). The organization claims to be independent. Yet about two-thirds of the organization are funded by the government. TUW’s research institutes work on behalf of the government, the business community and non-profit organizations. Both parties are therefore relatively reliable. They say they have no interest but are financed by interested parties.  Production Milieu Centraal says that wind energy is clean and comes from a never ending resource. They do not mention that if there is no wind or too much wind, there is no production of power. The CO2 emissions are 50 times lower than those of ‘grey’ electricity. However, according to Milieu Centraal, ‘some’ CO2 is released during construction, maintenance and demolition. But after 3 to 6 months of operation, a turbine has already saved that amount of CO2 emissions. Over the lifetime of a wind turbine, 20 years, it produces up to 80 times as much energy as it takes to build one. It has not been stated which factors have been included in this calculation. It can be assumed that these are the same factors as mentioned before: construction, maintenance and demolition. The factors transport and recycling are not included. It is impossible for the reader to ascertain what this calculation is based on. Transportation Unfortunately, we were unable to find emission figures for the transport of wind turbines. To get an idea of this factor, consider the following example: G. Vlastuin Transport is one of the largest transporters of wind turbines and wind turbine parts in the Netherlands. They transport parts up to 200 tons in weight throughout Europe. On January 1st, 2021, there will be 2,610 wind turbines in the Netherlands. Although it is not clear how much emissions the transport of windmill parts produces, it is likely that it is considerable. Usage Milieu Centraal says ”…the wind turbine only provides environmental benefits if it prevents more emissions than is generated during the construction and waste processing of the turbine.” Research by TUW shows that the amount of kWh produced by one wind turbine in about 20 years is so much that an entire solar park cannot compete. In these years, a windmill does not use fossil fuels and therefore no harmful substances are released. Dutch energy company Greenchoice also confirms this. They do indicate that a lot of fossil fuel is needed for the production and demolition of wind turbines. According to Vattenfall, they are recyclable. Manager of sustainable waste processing company Geocycle Eric Waeyenbergh disproves this statement. He says there are windmills currently being designed that can be recycled entirely. The blades cannot be broken down. They are buried, which in the long run causes a lot of environmental impact. Full reuse of wind turbines is therefore under development. “But dumping will be preferred in the coming years because it is cheaper,” says Eric Waeyenbergh. Breakdown Voor de Wereld van Morgen reports that in the coming years half of all wind turbines in the Flevopolder will be demolished, that (mostly) can not be recycled. There are currently 641 wind turbines. Windesheim University of Applied Sciences even estimates an additional influx of 1.3 kilotonnes of discarded windmill blades in 2025. This number is expected to double in 2040. Alternative ways of recycling are being devised. Such as processing shredded blades in asphalt or tiles. It is an increasingly well-known fact that the blades of windmills cannot be recycled. Impact on ecosystem According to estimates, about 50,000 birds per year die by 1,800 Dutch wind turbines. 2 Million birds die every year in traffic. An article by the Dutch Renewable Energy Association shows that by 2050 there will be more than 10,000 wind turbines in the Netherlands. Even in that scenario, fewer birds would die from windmills than from traffic. Although less so than through traffic, this does not alter the fact that windmills contribute to harming the bird population. Milieu Centraal does state that windmills also cause major disruption of food, rest and breeding areas. Conclusion The claim is Mostly False. Although Van Haga is correct that wind turbines are not completely sustainable, it is likely that they yield more than what they cost in terms of energy. The outcome of this factcheck leaned towards uncheckable because important factors are omitted in almost all studies. In order to give a quality assessment, there must be research in which all factors are taken into account. TUW appears to be a transparent and reliable source. They clearly state their sources and research can always be traced back. Milieu Centraal never actually names its sources. However, the information published by Milieu Centraal is assessed before publication by a scientific advisory board whose members and their employers are appointed on the website. Although both sources can be seen as reliable, it is important to know that Milieu Centraal is funded for 2/3 by the government and that 1/3 of the funding remains unexplained. TUW’s research institutes are also financed by interested parties. RESEARCH | ARTICLE: Maud Amptmeijer, Fleur Hienekamp. Leave our comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

9,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-the-european-unions-climate-tax-is-as-much-as-60-of-the-energy-production-costs/,“The European Union’s climate tax is as much as 60% of the energy production costs.”,2022-05-02,eufactcheck,,"Numerous billboards around Poland appeared around February 2022, reading: “The European Union’s climate tax is as much as 60% of the energy production costs. EU climate politics = expensive energy/high prices.” The billboards turned out to be part of a campaign ran by Polish state-owned utility companies, financed by the Polish Ministry of State Assets. The claim on the billboards turns out to be true but is rather misleading. The state-owned utility company called Towarzystwo Gospodarcze Polskie Elektrownie (TGPE) was responsible for coordinating the campaign all over Poland with support from the government. The claim on the billboards saying that 60% of the energy production costs consists of EU climate tax is true, but it can easily be misinterpreted by the target audience: consumers of electricity and other types of energy.   The company published a statement on their website where it explains how it had calculated the percentage. First, the emission costs per ton of CO2 are multiplied by the so-called emission factor. The outcoming is then divided by the average market price of electricity in 2022. When the two are added up, this provides the reader with the percentage found on the billboards: 59% (rounded up to 60%). The price of emission rights turns out to be correct and so does the price of electricity according to the European Emission Authority and the Polish government. Therefore, the calculations can be deemed as correct, but is misleading.   Polish think tank Forum Energii also states in one of their recent publications that the figure is correct, but also misleading to consumers of energy. The statement creates the impression that 60% of the consumer’s energy bill consists of emission rights. Therefore, not paying these emission rights would result in a 60% decrease of the energy bill. However, in addition to the cost of production there is also the cost of distribution, capacity, transition, value added tax, and more. With that in mind, only 23% of the consumer’s energy bill consists of emission right costs. Moreover, while the figure stated on the billboards is true, Poland generates the majority of its energy with fossil fuels resulting in pricey emission rights.   Conclusion The claim that “The European Union’s climate tax is as much as 60% of energy production costs”, is true. The calculations of the TGPE were done correctly with the data provided. However, the goal of the statement found on the billboards appears to convince the consumer that they’re paying huge amounts (60%), while only 23% of their total energy bill consists of emission rights according to the experts at Forum Energii.

10,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-generation-z-has-more-mental-health-problems-than-any-other-generation-before/,“Generation Z has more mental health problems than any other generation before”,2022-04-14,eufactcheck,,"German trend researcher Corinna Mühlhausen claims to have found out that “Generation Z suffers from psychological problems more than any other generation before it”. Even though the numbers of psychotherapies of children and adolescents are rising rapidly right now, it is not possible to verify this fact clearly. Therefore this claim must be classified as uncheckable. „Mental Imbalance Youth: The hurt of Generation Z. Generation Z suffers more from mental health problems than any other generation before, but it also paves the way for a new way of dealing with it. An excerpt from the Health Report 2022 by Corinna Mühlhausen.” Source: Zukunftsinstitut The European refugee crisis of 2015/16, the Covid pandemic and last but not least the Ukraine war have had a massive impact on mental stress. Members of Generation Z (i.e. children and young people born between 1997 and 2012) are particularly affected. According to the DAK’s (German health-insurance company) Children and Adolescents Report from 2019, that focused on depression and anxiety in school-aged children, 27% of children and adolescents in Germany suffer from psychological issues and have been treated medically at least once. In general, there has been an increase in psychotherapies in German health insurance companies, as the DAK mental report 2019 shows. While numbers in Germany steadily rise, the pooled overall prevalence of 17.6% for emotional and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents in Germany lies within the range reported in international reviews, confirms the HBSC longitudinal cross-national study. However, this trend is not limited to young people, but can also be seen in adults. For example, from 1997 to 2019, the number of days of absence due to mental illness inGermany increased by 239 percent and mental problems are the number one reason for missing work. In Germany, 9.7% of the adult population report at least one contact with psycho-therapeutic or psychiatric care providers within one year, according to a study by the Robert Koch Institut. Depression as highest diagnosis The problems that seem to be the most occurring in children as well as adults are depression and anxiety disorders. The WHO estimates that approximately 280 million people, which makes about 5% of adults worldwide, suffer from depression. Overall in the course of a year, 8.2%, or 5.3 million, of adult Germans (18-79 years) have a unipolar or persistent depressive disorder, estimates the Deutsche Depressionshilfe. However, it is difficult to determine an exact number of depression cases for children and adolescents, says doctor and research psychologist Claus Barkmann at the UKE Hamburg. „Just because the results of research shows increasing mental health issues, doesn’t mean that children are really affected because of a certain diagnosis […] many side effects and symptoms won’t be considered, as an example of symptom shifting. Depression in children shows completely different symptoms than in adults”. The Covid-19 pandemic has also impacted the mental health of children and adolescents. Cases and treatments have risen extremely, which makes it hard to make an adequate statement”, confirms Jona Stahmeyer, head of staff at the AOK (German health insurance company). Trauma transmission by parents Another contributing factor to the mental health of children and adolescents are their parents and/or legal guardians. What has been found out though, is that young people with parents who suffer from mental health problems are more likely to also suffer from them as well. The Children and Adolescents Report from 2019 by the DAK confirms that 33.6% of all DAK-insured children also have a parent who has received medical treatment at least once for mental health problems in 2017. That number is about 10% higher than for children without a mentally ill parent. Up to late adolescence, the observed risk for a mental illness in childhood is up to 80 % higher if one parent is mentally ill himself/herself, states the report. Doctor Claus Barkmann also confirms these findings: „The transgenerational transmission of trauma is quite possible. For example, children can inherit their parents’ trauma and then might encounter problems themselves.” Jona Stahmeyer explains the other side: „If mental health is talked about openly in the family, then the topic becomes less taboo with the children, and this rubs off”, which could explain the rise in psychotherapies being taken up. Inconsistencies in various studies Many studies confirm an increase in mental illnesses over the years, however, not all studies show the same results. The KIGGs longitudinal study shows that there is a downward trend in the number of mentally disturbed children and adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. Whereas 20% of children showed signs of mental illnesses, eleven years later it was only 16,9%. Jona Stahmeyer explains that a comparison of different studies is rather impossible, because of different data, guidelines and policies. Claus Barkmann also adds that every study uses different techniques and samples and can therefore not be adequately compared to one another. „There is a perception bias in research, as it is very popular to publish that children are mentally ill and less the other way around”, says Barkmann. This further shows the inconsistency in the research market. Comparison of generations To check the claim we have to look at the childhood and adolescents of the now adults. This seems to be impossible, as there is no available data to be found. The oldest studies accessible are from the 1980s and 1990s, which covers the childhood of Generation Y, but generations beforehand are left without data. „The health insurance funds are subject to a statutory deletion period of 7-8 years for patient data. Information before that, except for a few statistics, therefore no longer exists”, explains Jona Stahmeyer. Doctor Barkmann further elaborates that the definition, criteria and reputation of mental illnesses was so different compared to now, that problems were not treated or even talked about. „It is impossible to find good long term research about mental health, because the criteria for depression and anxiety changes constantly, every study also uses different variables and tools. So there is no possibility to compare the results of different years”, says Barkmann. He further elaborates that Generation Z is observed more than any generation before it in the area of mental health. This leads to the effect that it appears as if it is also the most mentallyaffected, but that’s not the truth with regard to the previous generations. Conclusion In short, the different researches can not be compared adequately. The lack of data for previous generations further proves that a comparison is impossible. This is why the claim by Mühlhausen has to be rated as uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

11,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-belgium-blocks-the-waiver-to-release-covid-vaccine-patents-for-the-third-world-the-most/,“Belgium blocks the waiver to release Covid-vaccine patents for the third world the most”,2022-04-11,eufactcheck,,"On January 15 2022, the chairman of the far-left party PVDA Raoul Hedebouw joined Conner Rousseau, chairman of left-wing party Vooruit, in an interview with De Morgen to discuss the possibility of releasing the Covid-vaccine patents. During this interview Hedebouw claimed that “of all European countries, Belgium blocks the waiver to release Covid-vaccine patents for the third world the most.” This statement turns out to be false. In Belgium, PVDA-PTB is an extreme left-wing party that is currently in the opposition to the federal government. The party is a strong advocate to the TRIPS waiver that was proposed by India and South Africa a year ago to temporarily release covid-vaccine patents for third world countries. It has made several proposals to lift the patents and wants the Belgian government to finally make a clear statement on their position. Hedebouw’s claim in Belgian newspaper De Morgen, 15 January 2022 No hard evidence We spoke to Sofie Merckx, member of PVDA and a member of the Belgian House of Representatives. She has designated herself the advocate of releasing the Covid-vaccine patents. In our interview, we confronted her with Hedebouw’s statement about Belgium’s role in the debate. He claimed that Belgium is the country that blocks the proposal to lift the vaccine patents the most. Merckx admitted that this is mainly an interpretation of mr. Hedebouw, not an actual fact: “There is no hard evidence that Belgium is one of the biggest counterparts.” Sofie Merckx submitted a resolution in the Health Committee of the Federal Parliament on December 20, 2021 to release the Covid-vaccine patents. In fact, she submitted the resolution several times in the last years, but it never got through. There are some parties in Belgium who support the idea of releasing the vaccine patents and some parties that don’t, but to this day the federal government of Belgium has not yet made its final decision whether it is against or for the patent waiver. Ms Merckx said that PVDA requested that Belgium positions itself separately from the European Commission in order to give its own view on the matter. However, to this day this hasn’t happened yet. Belgium’s vote isn’t decisive Vicky Marissen, expert on the European Union and currently affiliated to consultancy agency EPPA, explained in an interview why Belgium isn’t really the country that blocks the patent waiver the most. “The European Parliament can only vote on a resolution, it cannot make any decisions. When they pass a certain resolution, it does put extra pressure on the European Commission to actually vote on the matter.” Marissen explains that this hasn’t happened yet, because at the moment too many EU members are opposed to the idea. “Before voting on a resolution, the European Commission always consults the members of the European Union to see if the proposal has any chance of success. In this case, there are quite a lot of countries who are in favour of the idea, but there are also a lot of opponents. Because of this, they are convinced that the bill wouldn’t pass, so they haven’t proposed the idea yet to the European Council.” “Therefore”, Marissen explains, “we can’t really know for sure which countries are opposed and which aren’t, because they haven’t had to cast their vote yet. In the case of Belgium, this means that they have not yet spoken out publicly. It also means that you cannot say that Belgium blocks the proposal the most.” She adds: “The European Union consists of 27 member states who all get a vote. If Belgium decides to vote against or in favour of the waiver, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will or won’t get approved. Belgium is a fairly small country, its vote isn’t as decisive as Germany’s vote for example.” Conclusion The European Commission has not yet proposed the resolution to the European Council. While the European Parliament has already voted on the resolution, this is mostly symbolic and isn’t decisive. If or when the European Commission decides to propose the resolution to the European Council, 27 countries get to vote. Belgium is a fairly small country, so it doesn’t have the power to block the patent waiver. Therefore, it doesn’t have the deciding vote and cannot block the resolution the most. Furthermore, Belgium has yet to make a final decision whether it is in favour or against the patent waiver. In conclusion, Raoul Hedebouw’s claim has turned out to be false.

(…) I say yes, but then for some more serious crimes, we have to invent another name. I respect other people’s sacrifices, but not everything is the same. If everything is genocide, we will have to find another name for what the Nazis and the German machinery did to the Jews in the Second World War. It is the Holocaust, but it is also genocide. Not every victim is the same, it is relativization,” he said, answering a question on whether he considered Srebrenica a genocide. To make it short- Milanović in a long answer made an assumption that killling between 7000 and 8000 people in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb military in 1995 was not a genocide. Although Milanović tried to make comparison of the massacre with harder crimes, we found his claim that Srebrenica massacre is not a genocide mostly false. The distinction between genocides Croatia’s president compared genocide in Srebrenica with the mass killings in the concentration camp Jasenovac during World War Two, explaining that genocides in Srebrenica and Jasenovac are not the same because Jews and Serbs were systematically killed for several years in the Ustase-run concentration camp in Jasenovac. „Srebrenica is a genocide because someone insists on that“. His full quote was: „There are genocides and there are genocides. There are victims and victims. It’s not the same. It’s a lie. Srebrenica is a genocide, alright. Jasenovac is a genocide, is that the same? It’s not the same. In Jasenovac people have been killed for 2, perhaps even 3 years. Jews, even Serbs. 40,000 or 50,000 were murdered. Not in 2 days but in 2,5 years, intermittently.” The statement of the Croatian President hit the headlines of all media in the region, but in Bosnia and Herzegovina country that in the war 1992-1995 experienced bloodshed, cruelty and suffering that no one had seen in Europe since World War Two, the questioning of the Srebrenica massacre was taken as an offense by the Bosniak community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The  chairman of the Bosniak Ethnic Minority Council in Croatia, Armin Hodzic, said that Milanovic has crossed the line of civilization that no one should cross with his statements about the Srebrenica genocide. Definition of genocide The Convention on Genocide was among the first United Nations conventions addressing humanitarian issues. It was adopted in 1948 in response to the atrocities committed during World War II. The UN recognised that “genocide is an international crime, which entails the national and international responsibility of individual persons and states.” The Convention has since then been widely accepted by the international community and ratified by the overwhelming majority of States. In the Article II of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide the UN defined genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”The 5 acts are: 1. Killing members of the group, 2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, 3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; 4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; 5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights “any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited”. Through the definition of genocide, we presented human acts that need to be punished and convicted. With disapproval of characteristics like race or religion those acts are being made. Finally, we are talking about basic human differences that need no one’s approval. During the process against Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the court revealed a multitude of evidence publicly available that proves that Bosnian Serbs and other forces executed 7,000 to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim prisoners. The Tribunal proved that the killings were the product of a well-planned and coordinated operation. It also concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of 7,000 to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim prisoners was genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia wrote in their report that “the massacre that occurred in Srebrenica in July 1995 was the single worst atrocity committed in the former Yugoslavia during the wars of the 1990s and the worst massacre that occurred in Europe since the months after World War II”. We will go after those two events in history and try to conclude if they are similar enough to be called by the same name. Comparison between Bosniak and Jew genocide According to the International Criminal Court, genocide is an intention to destroy in whole or in a part some specific group. According to the previously mentioned definition, we tried to compare World War II genocide with the massacre in Srebrenica. Encyclopedia Britannica says: “The Holocaust (1933–1945) was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million European Jews by the Nazi German regime and its allies and collaborators.” The point of the Holocaust was to make the world Jew-free. Its intention was to delete them as a whole. Srebrenica genocide was murder of eight thousand men and boys to make the Srebrenica area Muslim-free. If we look back at the UN definition of genocide, where it is defined by “killing members of the group” it definitely refers to the Srebrenica massacre as well. The killed victims were not battle casualties and they were all Bosniac Muslims. Therefore, there is no need for creating levels of genocide when the intention was the same. There are other causalities that make a crime larger (like the size of perpetrator’s army and weapon), but they also cannot mean that we should give different names to genocides. After all, would we also have to rename some war crimes and thefts, just because they’re bigger than others? Conclusion Even though the Croatian president Milanović tried to differentiate genocides based on the number of victims and duration of the crimes, Srebrenica still is a genocide. That is what the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and UN Convention had confirmed. The differences Milanović mentioned do exist, but the scale and horror of one genocide won’t diminish when we compare it to another one. Based on our factchecking process, the president’s claim is mostly false.

This claim turns out to be uncheckable. Deloitte is globally settled in over 150 countries with Deloitte Central Europe covering 18 countries. On its website Deloitte states that it is set on achieving net-zero CO2-emissions. In a recent press release, the Belgian subsidiary says it is well on its way to achieve that goal as it has allegedly reduced its emissions by a third over the last three years. However, in that same press release, Deloitte adds the nuance that the change in behavior due to the global pandemic accounted for a part of that reduction as under a simulation of “normal behavior” the reduction would only amount to 23%. The company also says the mileage has gone down by 17 percent in comparison to 2017. However, the concrete data and methods supporting this claim are not published in the report. No evidence for the claim Therefore EUfactcheck asked Deloitte Belgium’s marketing and communications department to share the data and calculations the conclusions of the report are based on. After a number of emails and phone calls, managing director Tom Meynendonckx promised to send EUfactcheck the requested data. However, EUfactcheck never received the promised information. Two months after the initial request, the firm’s communication officer stated that she was not able to give any of the requested information, ‘as all the methods, statistics and results are intellectually and commercially owned by Deloitte’. Conclusion Because of Deloitte Belgium’s refusal to share its data and methods, the claim that the company has reduced its CO2-emissions by a third is uncheckable.

After loosing its parliamentary majority in July 2021, the Moldovan Socialist Party claimed that the new government’s measures led to a near 60% reduction in vaccination rates in Moldova. The claim turns out to be mostly false. In Moldova, the pro-European “Action and Solidarity” (PAS) party won a parliamentary majority in the July 2021 elections. The new government was officially inaugurated on the 6th of August, having Natalia Gavriliță as a prime minister. Before that, the Socialists and Democrats had the parliamentary majority in Moldova. The Socialists blame the pro-European PAS party for the vaccination decrease Almost two months after the inauguration of the new prime minister, the left-wing Moldovan Socialist Party publishes a news item. The news article claims that Moldova’s vaccination rate has decreased by almost 60% as a result of the new government’s actions. The socialists state that between July 6 and August 5, 335,044 people got vaccinated in Moldova, compared to 148,690 people that have been immunized with the vaccine from August 6 until September 5. But did the vaccination rate drop by almost 60% during those weeks? And if so, was the new government to blame for the decrease? According to the daily vaccination reports, requested from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Moldova, between July 6 and August 5, 335,054 people got vaccinated, a number very similar to the one given by the socialists. But the alleged drop by “almost 60 %” turns out to be slight exaggeration. The reports from the Ministry of Health show that from August 6 to September 5, 342 824 people have been vaccinated, meaning that the vaccination rate decreased by 56%, instead of 60%. The new government is not responsible for the vaccination decrease While the Socialists blame the new government for the drop in vaccinations, the “Action and Solidarity” party can hardly be held responsible for the temporary decrease of the vaccination rate. According to Ala Tocarciuc, independent consultant and expert in public health, the drop in the vaccination rate was influenced by multiple factors: “I do not think that the change of the political structure in the Parliament has a direct impact on the dynamics of the vaccination campaign. The access to the vaccine and the presence of fake news – all together fueled the reluctance of the vaccination”. Conclusion The claim “Due to the new government’s measures, Moldova’s vaccination rate decreased by 60%” is mostly false. According to the daily reports of the Ministry of Health, the vaccination rate in the country dropped by 56%, not 60%. Moreover, the second part of the statement is not correct either, as short-term changes in the vaccination rate cannot be directly attributed to a change in the government.

15,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-spains-chamber-of-deputies-is-the-most-equal-in-the-european-union/,“Spain’s Chamber of Deputies is the most equal in the European Union”,2022-02-03,eufactcheck,,"On November 26th, Pedro Sánchez, Spanish prime minister, spoke at “Mujeres Parlamentarias” forum, where he claimed that “Spain has nowadays the most equal chamber of deputies in terms of gender of the European Union, with a total of 166 women in it”. However, Spain does not have the most equal chamber of deputies of the EU, and neither it has 166 women in it. Therefore, Pedro Sánchez claim is wrong. Pedro Sanchez’ claim in El Mundo from 26 November 2021. On the first place, the Spanish chamber of deputies has a total of 350 seats, and right now there is 151 of them that are occupied by women, which makes it the 43% of the total. On the second place, to prove if Pedro Sánchez’s statement was true, we took a look on the numbers that the European Institute for Gender Equality provides. These proves that, right now, Spain is the third country of the EU with more gender equality in its Chamber. Sweden and Finland are the leaders in terms of parity in their chambers. Sweden, that has the first place, has a 47% of women of the 349 deputies that make up the Riksdag. Next is Finland, that is the second country in the European Union with the highest parity: 45.5% of the 200 Finnish deputies are women. And then, there is Spain, with a 43% of women in the national chamber. European Institute for Gender Equality (Indicator: National parliaments) So, Sweden, Finland and Spain are right now leading this list. The data shows that the ones with less gender parity are Cyprus, with 14.3% of women in its parliament, Malta with 13.4%, and at the bottom of the list there is Hungary, where only 12.6% of the 199 seats in the Országgyűlés (National Assembly of Hungary) are occupied by women. A confusion? Pedro Sánchez was wrong about Spain having right now the most equal chamber of deputies, however, his claim might have been a consequence of a confusion. Back in 2019, after the general elections in April 2019, Spain had 166 women in its chamber of deputies. In that moment, Spain had indeed the most parity chamber of deputies of the European Union, but it didn’t last long. The socialist party was supposed to get to an agreement with the other parties to be able to form a government, but it was impossible, so they had to announce elections once again. After the general elections of November 2019, Spain lost its first place and stopped having the most parity chamber of the EU. Conclusion Pedro Sánchez stated a wrong claim but perhaps it happened unintentionally and as a mistake because on one point in 2019 Spain had the most equal chamber of deputies, but that didn´t last long and right now is just wrong.

16,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-omicron-spreads-much-faster-than-other-strains-of-covid-19/,Omicron spreads much faster than other strains of Covid-19,2022-02-02,eufactcheck,,"On December 14, the Russian news agency INTERFAX.RU published that the Omicron strain of Covid-19 is spreading much faster than other earlier strains that scientists have identified during the pandemic. This statement is true.  The first mention of a new coronavirus infection occurred at the end of December 2019. Dr. Li Wenliang, who works in the emergency department at the Wuhan Central Hospital, was the first to drew attention to the new disease. On December 30, in a WeChat group chat, he shared with colleagues his worst fears – Li Wenliang assumed the beginning of a new wave of SARS. However, the first official publication in the media about Covid-19 dates back to January 5, 2020. According to the website of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, between January 5, 2020 and February 5, 2020, Covid-19 infection was found in 20 countries. As is shown in the table below. Omicron spread – source: website of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control Next up: the Delta variant In December 2020, Indian scientist found a new strain of Covid-19 named Delta. It revealed two mutations of the spike protein – the part of the virus with which it is introduced into the cells of the human body. Scientists have found that this facilitates the penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body and thus contributes to infection. There is also a risk of infection with the delta variant of both people who have already had a coronavirus infection and those who have been vaccinated. During the summer of 2021, this virus spread rapidly and by the July 4, it was found at more than 104 countries.  After the Delta strain, “Delta Plus” appeared. The peculiarity of Delta plus is that it affects many cells at once, a person infected with this strain will transmit the infection to a large number of people at once, while infection occurs much faster than with earlier strains of coronavirus. In early November 2021, the media started talking about a new strain of Covid-19, which was named Omicron and was first found in South Africa. On December 14 2021, at a WHO briefing, the Director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that 77 countries had reported cases of Omicron detection. However, in reality, Omicron probably exists in most countries, even if it has not yet been discovered. Media Briefing on Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation on 14 December 2021 (timing screenshot: 02:34) According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the variant of Covid-19 Omicron has been confirmed in 25 countries of the European Union, as well as in 50 countries outside the EU. Conclusion The facts listed above indicate that the information is correct, since the data from the WHO Director’s statement and the data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have insignificant differences (75 and 77). In addition, Omicron does spread faster than past Covid-19 strains. In less than a month, it was found in 77 countries, while the classic version of Covid-19 was detected only in 20. The Delta strain, in turn, shows an approximate result in 13 countries per month (considering that in 8 months since its appearance it was detected in 104 countries). Thus, the most “tough” strain of the coronavirus has the slowest spread rate, while the most “light” strain has the highest spread rate. But only scientists can comment on why this is so.

17,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-left-wing-extremism-continues-to-grow-and-grow-stronger-in-germany/,“Left-wing extremism continues to grow and grow stronger in Germany”,2022-01-28,eufactcheck,,"The German politician Malte Kaufmann from the right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) wants to classify anti-fascist groups as terrorist networks and have them banned. He cites the rising numbers of left-wing extremist crimes in Germany as justification. The claim turns out to be mostly true. The reason for Kaufmann’s claim was an article by Focus Online, according to which death lists with AfD politicians, their addresses and instructions for explosive devices were published in left-wing extremist forums. On 1 October 2021, the member of the German parliament tweeted: “#Left-wing extremism continues to grow and grow stronger in Germany. Therefore: classify #Antifa as a terror network and ban it!” Definition of extremism and left-wing extremism According to German extremism researcher Armin Pfahl-Traugber in “Linksextremismus in Deutschland (2014)” (Left-wing extremism in Germany) the term “extremism” goes back to the Latin word “extremus”, i.e., “the extreme”, and thus represents the extreme opposition of a standpoint. At the same time, this means that extremism does not stand alone, but always in relation to something else. In the political context, extremism is defined as political aspirations that strictly reject the existing social and state order. For this understanding, it is less the justification and the goals of the actors that play a role, but rather the fundamental rejection of the political conditions.  The term “left-wing extremism” is understood by extremism researcher Pfahl-Traughber as a collective term for all political views that reject the norms and rules of a modern democratic constitutional state and demand a social order characterised by social equality. The ideologies, organisations and strategies of the actors can differ according to this understanding, but what they have in common is the prominent position of equality, the aspirations against the norms of the democratic constitutional state and the primary focus on the means used and less on the interest goals of the actors. Common fields of action of left-wing extremism are: “anti-nuclear”, “anti-fascism”, “anti-tribalisation”, “anti-globalisation”, “anti-imperialism”, “anti-capitalism”, “anti-militarism”, “anti-repression” and “anti-Zionism”. Danger from left-wing extremism The German Federal Ministry of the Interior sees the greatest danger to public security within the left-wing extremist spectrum among the violence-oriented left-wing extremists, most of whom belong to the autonomous scene. For autonomists, the use of violence – also against persons – is a legitimate means to achieve their goals. They justify violence as allegedly necessary against the “structural violence” of a “system of coercion, exploitation and oppression”. According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the focus of the violence is primarily on the police and right-wing extremists identified as such, but also on business enterprises especially from the real estate industry. Increasing numbers? From 4,898 to 10,971 cases: the total number of criminal and violent offences committed by left-wing extremists has increased by almost 124 per cent since 2005. However, not continuously: In 2018, the number of cases was significantly lower than in previous years.   In the years from 2012 to 2020, the number of left-winged criminal offenses in Germany overall increased. In 2014, 2016 and 2018 the number of cases was lower compared to the previous year. Although it is recognisable that the total amount of the criminal and violent acts increased, some types of left-wing extremism decreased. These are mainly those that are specifically aimed at injuring individuals – such as bodily harm, attempted murder, deprivation of liberty or blackmail.   Some types of left-wing extremism decreased. Especially between 2015 and 2019, there was a significant decline in cases of bodily harm by left-winged extremists. So, while the total number has risen, the number of crimes directly against the lives of fellow human beings has fallen or stagnated. This is also confirmed by the number of left-wing extremist persons surveyed by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. While the number of extremists is rising, the number of those prepared to use violence is much lower and remains almost constant: In 2020, out of 34,300 known left-wing extremists, only 9,600 were classified as ready to use violence.   Between 2018 and 2020, the number of extremists increased. However, the number of those prepared to use violence remained almost constant. These numbers have to be looked at in the context of right-wing extremism. Contextualisation A right-wing extremist orientation shows itself above all in xenophobia, discrimination and racism. In an interview with ZDF, political scientist Jakob Feustel explains right-wing extremists like this: “All together they serve the German victim myth, fantasise about a conspiracy against the people and want to escalate the circumstances to the point of overthrow”. A left-wing extremist orientation shows itself, apart from criticising the state, also in the fight against exclusion of individuals or groups. Left-wing extremists want to overcome capitalism and oppose any form of exclusion, the scientist explains. “So, while some want to get rid of people and let them strive, the others oppose that very thing.” It can therefore be assumed that left-wing extremism is increasing due to a rise in right-wing extremism. This is also confirmed by the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.   At its peak in 2020, the total number of right-wing criminal offenses was 23.604. The highest number of left-wing criminal offenses was 10.971 in 2020. It is obvious that the number of right-wing extremist crimes has been significantly higher than that of left-wing extremist crimes for a long time. Furthermore, an even greater difference can be assumed. There are two main reasons for this: In contrast to other politically motivated crime phenomena, the offence area of “mass militancy” has increased significantly due to the increasing number of protests and demonstrations. According to the Federal Agency for Civic Education, this mainly includes left-motivated crimes, as these are mostly directed against police officers, who in most cases report assaults at demonstrations. In contrast right-wing extremist violence is predominantly directed against migrants, some of whom have had negative experiences with the police in their countries of origin and are probably less likely to report it due to language barriers. So, although significantly more cases of left-wing motivated violence are reported, the total number of right-wing extremist crimes is significantly higher. According to the Federal Agency for Civic Education, this must be considered when interpreting the case figures. Conclusion After all, Malte Kaufmann’s claim can be considered largely true. However, his statement should be put into context. Kaufmann belongs to a party that has been classified by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as a right-wing extremist inspection case and is also likely to become a suspect case.

He claims that major sporting events never lead to an improvement of human rights in the hosting country. This statement is mostly true. Frequently, major sporting events are held in countries where human rights organisations consider the situation to be critical. Currently, Qatar is the focus of public attention and criticism due to the upcoming Football World Cup 2022. In this context, the director of Human Rights Watch Germany, Wenzel Michalski, said: “[…] so far, no major sporting event has ever led to an improvement of human rights in the hosting country.” In an interview with the German newspaper “Der Tagesspiegel”, Michalski refers to the responsibilities of the organisations, such as those of FIFA, but nevertheless clearly rejects a boycott. Nothing would be worse than a country isolated from the public. Boycotts should take place on a diplomatic level only, he argues,for example through the non-presence of political prominence. In the past, individual countries boycotted tournaments because of political differences, but never for human rights reasons. Whether a boycott would have made sense due to the human rights situation in a host country can therefore not be verified. If we look at the last five Summer and Winter Olympic Games as well as the Football World Cup as the largest sporting events in the world, it is noticeable that countries which seem critical at first sign like China and Russia have regularly hosted tournaments. Football World CupOlympic Summer GamesOlympic Winter Games2002: South Korea/Japan 2004: Athens, Greece2002: Salt Lake City, United States of America2006: Germany2008: Beijing, China2006: Turin, Italy2010: South Africa2012: London, United Kingdom2010: Vancouver, Canada2014: Brazil2016: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil2014: Sochi, Russia2018: Russia2021: Tokio, Japan2018: Pyeongchang, South Korea The Freedom in the World Report shows that the situation there in fact has not improved. It has been published since 1973 and displays the freedom and democracy of 195 countries and 16 territories and countries with limited recognition. The report produces annual scores representing the levels of political rights and civil liberties in each state and territory, on a scale from 1 (most free) to 7 (least free). Depending on the ratings, the nations are then classified as “free”, “partly free”, or “not free”. A look at past tournaments China is classified as “not free”. The host of the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics has received a rating of 7 in political rights and 6 in civil liberties since 2001 until today. The reasons are varied and include internet surveillance and heavy sentences handed down to human rights lawyers, microbloggers, activists and religious believers. South Africa’s ranking has not improved either. During the 2010 World Cup, the country was criticised for human rights abuses during construction. Nevertheless, the country is considered “free”. Since the end of apartheid in 1994, it has been regarded globally as a proponent of human rights and a leader on the African continent. From 2005 to 2006 South Africa’s political rights rating declined from 1 to 2 due to the ruling of the African National Congress party’s growing monopoly and its increasing technocracy. The last World Cup was held in Russia in 2018. Russia also hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics. The country is classified as “not free”. Until 2014, the political rights rating was 6, while the civil liberties rating was 5. From 2014 to 2016, both ratings were 6. From 2017, the political rights rating reached 7, the worst possible rating. The reason for the deterioration is the expanded media controls, a dramatically increased level of propaganda on state-controlled television, and new restrictions on the ability of some citizens to travel abroad. In the case of Qatar, the scores remain constant at 6 for political rights and 5 for civil rights. Despite individual advances, such as the introduction of the labour court and the minimum wage, there is no change in the overall view. It is impossible to predict how the situation will develop, but considering previous tournaments, an improvement is unlikely.  Conclusion  The topic always receives attention just in time for major sporting events, which is why the associations also react: For example, FIFA presented a report on human rights in 2016 and even the German Bundestag debated the human rights situation in various host countries, so the public debate does have an effect. However, despite individual positive changes measured by the world freedom index there have been no improvements in the last 20 years. Therefore, Michalski’s statement is mostly true.

19,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-croatia-spent-24-times-more-euros-on-census-than-slovenia-which-has-2-million-fewer-citizens/,Croatia spent 24 times more euros on census than Slovenia which has 2 million fewer citizens,2022-01-21,eufactcheck,,"In year 2021 Croatia conducted a population census which happens every ten years.  Mr Nenad Pokos, a Croatian demographer and professor, commented on it and said in the interview for the regional news channel N1: “The price of Slovenian register-based census in 2011 was one million euros, and the Croatian traditional census in 2021 cost 24 million euros. We (Croatians) spent 24 times more, and there are 2 million fewer citizens in Slovenia than in Croatia“. The claim turns out to be mostly true. To check if the demographer’s statement is true, we decided to check the price of the Slovenian census in 2011, the price of the Croatian census in 2021, the difference between the number of citizens in Slovenia and Croatia, and the difference between the costs in above-mentioned censuses. Slovenia switched to register-based census method in 2011 Croatia uses traditional census as a method. It is conducted by going from household to household where enumerators fill out DZS’ forms according to citizens’ responses. In 2011 Slovenia switched from traditional census method to register-based. That is a method of collecting data by linking existing administrative and statistical sources and databases without using a field survey. According to Statistical Office RS, the 2011 census cost 10% of the traditional census from 2002. In this way they saved at least 10 million euros, which means that the census cost them one million euros in 2011. Therefore, part of Mr Pokos’ statement that the census in Slovenia cost one million euros is true.  The price of the Croatian census in 2021 Furthermore, while the official cost of the Croatian census in year 2021 will be known in year 2022, two sources provide information about the allocation of resources for this activity. First, the Croatian government allocated approximately 23.6 million euros from the state budget for the 2021 Census – 21.7 million euros for the Central Bureau of Statistics for the period between the year 2018 and 2022, and 1.9 million euros for the State Geodetic Administration. This cost is slightly at odds with the numbers published in December 2020 in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia, Narodne novine,  according to which the Central Bureau of Statistics received 23.3 million euros for the Census 2021 for the period from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, according to the Croatian Official Gazette the State Geodetic Administration received approximately 1.9 million euros.  After summing up, as stated in Narodne novine, the cost of Croatian Census 2021 was approximately 25.2 million euros. Even though the costs from these two sources do not match completely, it must be taken into consideration that these were assessments done before conducting the census. Therefore, Mr Pokos’ assessment that the cost of the Croatian census 2021 was 24 million euros is an estimate which is in line with the numbers we found. The number of citizens in Slovenia and Croatia Moreover, Mr Pokos said in his statement that there are 2 million fewer citizens in Slovenia than there are in Croatia. To check the truthfulness of that statement, we consulted the web pages of the Slovenian statistical office and the results of the last Croatian census in 2011. Due to the register-based method of population census, Slovenia publishes statistics on the number of inhabitants several times a year. The last report was in July 2021, according to which there were 2.107.007 inhabitants in Slovenia. According to the last census in 2011, Croatia had 4.284.889 inhabitants. Even though we do not have the current numbers of the population of Croatia, according to this data, Croatia has 2.177.882 more inhabitants than Slovenia does. Considering that Professor Pokos probably presented a rough estimate to make a point, we consider this statement to be quite accurate. Did Croatia spend 24 times more than Slovenia? The price of the Slovenian census in 2011 was approximately 1 million euros, and the price of the Croatian census in 2021 was between 23.5 million euros and 25.2 million euros, or as Professor Pokos estimates – 24 million euros. Hence, Croatia has spent around 24 times more euros on its census that Slovenia did. Conclusion After analyzing numerous sources and after contacting Professor Pokos for information about the sources for the statement, we believe this statement is mostly true. It is important to point out the sources which were given to us by Profesor Pokos were not accepted at face value. The reason we proclaim the statement mostly true is based on our perception that the numbers in the statement were ‘rounded up’ to emphasize the significant difference between Censuses, which is undoubtedly present.

She stated that the disoriented and excessive corona policy of the German federal government has played a considerable role in this. We rate this claim as mostly true. At a public debate on the federal election Alice Weidel described the situation in Germany as a wall full of corona measures while other neighboring countries are back to normal. According to the politican this explains that only 11% of the citizens feel free in their everyday lives. Since Weidel does not give a source or comparative figures, this statement should be checked. According to a study by the European Council on Foreign Relations, it is true that only 11% feel free in their everyday life. However, one must mention, 35% feel partly free and 5% don’t know. One shouldn’t leave the 35% out of consideration, it only leads to a distorted perception. The remaining 49% don’t feel free at all. Why we shouldn’t trust only one number To correctly interpret these numbers, it is important to take a look at the recent trends: How much has the feeling changed compared to the 2019 survey? The study shows that there has been a decline of the feeling of freedom in all European countries, not only in Germany. In Germany it has decreased from 68% to 11%. But in Austria, for example, 78% of respondents felt free in 2019. In 2021 it was only 15%. Portugal fell from 66% to 16% and the Netherlands from 79% to 19%. Therefore, Germany doesn’t have such an extreme decline on its own, which the graphic illustrates again.   European countries from the greatest decline in the feeling of freedom to the smallest. Another important point which Alice Weidel doesn’t mention is that although Germany comes last when the question is “how free do you feel?”, in other countries comparatively more people blame the government for the Covid-19 crisis including the lack of freedom. In Germany only 36% blame institutions and the government. The others say the individuals are to blame – or nobody at all. However, in Spain 57% say its the government’s fault. In Poland even 58%. Compared to other countries, more Germans trust the government and the associated Covid-19 measures. In Germany 65% were trustful, 15% were “the accusers” and 21% “the suspicious”. Weidel interprets the low percentage of the feeling of freedom as very negative. However, since many Germans trust the state and can understand the measures, they would not necessarily decide against measures and more freedom, insofar as they are understandable. Among those impacted by the illness, 40% in Germany believe the restrictions were about right. 20% think the restrictions were too strict and 40% think they were not even strict enough. So, the 11%, which Alice Weidel refers to are true. But she leaves out relevant numbers and facts that don’t support her thesis. Germans feel more restricted by corona measures Weidel’s statement that there are significantly stronger measures in other neighboring countries should be checked too. What is particularly interesting here is the citizens’ sense of freedom in relation to the respective measures in a country. Oxford University, under the direction of the Blavatnik School of Government, has developed a scale that shows the personal measures in a country. Using this method they developed the Stringency Index. The Stringency Index is for comparative purposes only and should not be interpreted as an assessment of the appropriateness or effectiveness of any country’s response. In order to determine to what extent certain measures have influenced the citizens’ feeling of freedom, we used the Covidtracker to determine the Stringency Index between late May and early June, the time the survey was conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations. It has been shown that at the time of the survey, Germany had the strongest corona measures with a Stringency Index of 75. The Stringency Index of other EU countries is not far from it: Italy has a Stringency Index of 71 and Austria of 68. Although the Stringency Index of Italy is only slightly below that of Germany, 16% of the people feel free, 55% partially free, 4% don’t know and 25% don’t feel free. Italy is an exception, but it shows that the Italians feel comparatively free even though they are subject to similar measures as Germans. From the end of May to the beginning of June 2021, Germany had the highest stringency index in Europe, followed by Italy, nevertheless the feeling of freedom was different. The Stringency Index shows: Germany reacts to many corona cases with significantly stricter measures than other neighboring countries. Weidel’s statement that some neighboring countries have significantly weaker measures is true. Furthermore, the Germans also feel much more restricted and less free than other countries with similar measures. Conclusion The investigation shows that Weidel’s statement should not be categorized as completely true. Weidel omits figures from the study by the European Council on Foreign Relations and thus manipulates the perception of her listeners. She only mentioned certain facts to support her opinion.There is also another country with similarly strong measures, where residents feel freer. It has been shown that the feeling of freedom fell in every country during the pandemic. Notably, in comparison to neighbouring countries, Germans don’t blame the government for the general covid crisis, with the majority trusting the motivations of the government in respect to the lockdown restrictions.

21,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-cannabis-legalization-leads-to-increased-use/,Cannabis legalization leads to increased use,2021-12-21,eufactcheck,,"German politician Stephan Pilsinger (CSU) has criticized the considerations of the newly elected German government to decriminalize cannabis. He claims that after legalization, cannabis consumption will increase. Pilsinger refers to studies from the USA. Even though there are numbers which support his claim, there is no clear evidence that legalization automatically leads to more consumption. This is why we rate the claim as uncheckable. Cannabis is one of the most used substances worldwide. The legalization of cannabis is currently being discussed in Germany. The new government wants to legalize the sale of cannabis for consumption. In a speech on the Cannabis Control Act, Stephan Pilsinger (CSU) expressed himself critically. He thinks that the legalization would increase the use of cannabis in Germany. “The US state of Colorado shows the consequences of legalizing cannabis. […] Studies from the USA show that the legalization of cannabis is associated with a significant increase in consumption.” Figures from other countries in which cannabis use has already been legalized are usually used as evidence for those assumptions. In Germany, opinions are divided about possible cannabis legalization. In November 2012, Colorado voters passed Constitutional Amendment 64 which legalized marijuana for recreational purposes for anyone over the age of 21. The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (RMHIDTA) program has published annual reports every year since 2013 tracking the impact of legalizing recreational marijuana in Colorado. The numbers show that the past month marijuana use (ages 12 and older) increased 30% and is 76% higher than the national average. In contrast, past month youth marijuana (ages 12-17) use decreased 25% but is still 43% higher than the national average. The figures from the USA show that the legalization of cannabis has different effects depending on the age group and does not necessarily lead to increased consumption. Cannabis use in Canada increased after the legalization in 2019 The long-term effects of cannabis legalization are particularly visible in Portugal. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized the public and private use, acquisition, and possession of all drugs with the focus on public health rather than public-order priorities. An investigation by the German Bundestag shows that the lifetime prevalence in the age group from 15 to 64 years, which includes any drug use during the person’s life, fell from 12% to 9% between 2007 and 2012. In 2011, the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) found an increase in the use of illegal drugs by schoolchildren in Portugal. However, this increase should also be assessed in the context of a similar development in Europe and the financial crisis, which hit Portugal particularly hard. On the contrary research from Transform Drug Policy Foundation (tdpf) point out that the apparent decline in drug use was reflected in a decrease in the proportion of people who had previously used an illicit drug but no longer do so (from around 45% to below 30% between 2001 and 2012). Overall, decriminalization had little to no effect on the prevalence of drug use in Portugal. While Portugal’s legalization is a long time ago, the regulations in Canada were only recently changed. On October 17, 2018, the Government of Canada legalized cannabis for non-medical purposes. Provincial and territorial jurisdictions are responsible for developing their own regulations. In order to collect profound information, Health Canada developed and implemented the Canadian Cannabis Survey (CCS). The aim of the annual CCS is to obtain detailed information about the habits of people who use cannabis. Survey results are based on responses from 10.822 respondents aged 16 years and older across Canada. According to the National Cannabis Survey, in the first quarter of 2019 about 5.3 million or 18% of Canadians aged 15 years and older reported using cannabis in the last three months. This was higher than the 14% who reported using one year earlier, before legalization. At the provincial level, there was minimal change in rates of cannabis consumption between the first quarters of 2018 and 2019, except for Ontario where prevalence increased from 14% to 20%.  Conclusion It’s very difficult to determine whether an increase or decrease in drug use is directly related to changes in the law. According to the current state of research, legalizing cannabis does not automatically lead to more consumption. In the different countries, the data situation and the results vary heavily. In some countries the number of consumers rises after decriminalization, in others it’s falling – both among adults and young people. But cannabis use also depends on other factors. These include external factors like a financial crisis or currently the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, according to EMCDDA’s European Drugs Division the number of people using cannabis rises worldwide. Finally, the consumption also depends on the educational work carried out in each country.

22,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-strokes-after-the-covid-19-vaccination-are-a-very-common-side-effect/,“Strokes after the Covid-19 vaccination are a very common side effect”,2021-12-20,eufactcheck,,"On 22nd of September 2021, the member of the Austrian National Council Dr. Dagmar Belakowitsch made a statement during a speech in front of the national council where she talked about the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccination and said: “I mean those who have strokes after the vaccinations. This is a very common side effect.” Both the results of medical studies and the opinion of numerous experts clearly show that this statement is false. Dagmar Belakowitsch is a member of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and currently chairs the Committee for Health Affairs. Before she became a board member of the local party in Vienna, she studied medicine at the University of Vienna and Graz. Herbert Kickl, the leader of the Freedom Party published a video on Facebook which showed parts of Belakowitsch´s speech in which she made her comments about the side effects of the vaccination, the video got over 100.000 views. In her speech she also said that she thinks there is hardly anyone in Austria who does not know someone who has side effects after this vaccination. And that doesn´t include people who have a cough or runny nose, it´s about the people with serious side effects like a stroke. Getting a stroke after the vaccination? Every year around 25.000 people in Austria are suffering a stroke. A stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. It occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts. When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood it needs, so it’s brain cells die. In Austria, strokes are the third most common cause of death in Austria after cardiovascular diseases and cancer. So, if the over 7.7 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines which have been used till now would cause more cases of strokes that would have some serious effects on the health condition of people worldwide. So, are strokes really a common side effect of the vaccination? The answer to that question is a clear ‘No’. Wolfgang Serles, the President of the Austrian Stroke Society explained that a post-vaccination stroke is a blockage of the cerebral veins. However, he said that this is a very rare occurrence. Xabier Urra, neurologist at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and a fellow of the European Stroke Organisation, adds: “This is 99% false. Can Covid-19 vaccines cause stroke? Yes, this has been seen and described. But we are talking about a very rare stroke, it is cerebral venous thrombosis with vaccine-induced platelet thrombosis. A stroke is any brain problem caused by an acute alteration of circulation. The most common are ischemic strokes, they are more than 80%. It has now been discovered that there are some vaccines, such as AstraZeneca or Johnson, that can induce venous thrombosis by an immune-mediated mechanism. This is true, but it is very rare, we are talking about a case within ten thousand diagnosed. It is very uncommon and not a public health problem. Here at the Clinic, we have seen two or three cases, it is true, but there is no epidemic of cases caused by the vaccine.” Moreover, there is also a study which got released by the university of Oxford with the data of more than 29 million people. The study showed that there were for every ten million people vaccinated with the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine 143 additional cerebral arterial occlusions with a possible connection to vaccination – almost twelve times less than with a Covid-19 infection. Therefore, the risk of getting a stroke or other serious diseases which are related to strokes after the Covid-19 vaccination are much lower than getting it after an infection with Covid-19, you can also see that in the graph below which is a summary of the Oxford study. https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1931 To further prove that strokes are not a very common side effect as Dagmar Belakowitsch stated, we went through a report by Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care because they record suspected side effects of vaccines. In their report there is no data about strokes as a side effect after a Covid-19 vaccination due to their rare occurrence. Conclusion Belakowitsch did not mention a concrete number, she only said very common, a term which can be interpreted differently by everyone. But although there is no concrete number, the opinions of various experts and the data and statistics regarding the side effects of the vaccination clearly show that the claim is false. There were some cases of strokes linked to the vaccination but these were so few that it´s nowhere near to a “very common side effect”. We also tried to reach out to Dagmar Belakowitsch and asked her about the sources her claim was based on, but our request was left unanswered.

23,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-more-hospitalizations-of-children-with-depression/,“More hospitalizations of children with depression”,2021-12-10,eufactcheck,,"On March 30, 2021, ZEIT online claimed More hospitalizations of children with depression. Already before Covid 19 the number of young patients with depression increased by 24 percent in 2019. This claim turns out to be mostly true. Zeit online claims “More hospitalizations of children with depressions”. Although there are no data since the beginning of the pandamic, the article gives the impression that it’s not a Covid19 phenomenon. The article addresses the issue of depression in children and adolescents. The author says that even before the pandemic, depression was rising sharply in young patients. He refers to the results of a study by the Federal Statistical Office. The study “Number of psychotherapists increased by 19% from 2015 to 2019” was published on March 30, 2021. In this study, it is about the numbers of psychotherapists, numbers of children and adolescents with depression and the numbers of psychotherapy students. The numbers of the study of the Federal Statistical Office to which ZEIT online refers in the article, say that the number of children and adolescents treated as inpatients has increased by 24 percent from 2015 to 2019. In 2015 there were 14,500 young patients and in 2019 there are 18,000 who were treated for depression. Is the source trustworthy? The Federal Statistical Office is a very reliable source, as they provide data on all relevant social issues. This information is available to everyone and has been collected objectively. The Federal Statistical Office must adhere to the BStatG, the Federal Statistics Act, and is therefore a safe and trustworthy source. The Federal Statistics Act states that current data on mass phenomena are to be collected, processed and analyzed. This is to be done neutrally, objectively and professionally independently. The task of the Federal Statistical Office is, according to the Federal Statistics Law §3 Abs.1.1, to prepare and develop statistics for federal purposes (federal statistics) methodically and technically in consultation with the statistical offices of the Countries. Prof. Dr. Michael Kölch, Deputy President of the German Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Rostock, confirmed in an interview that the figures of the Federal Statistical Office from 2015 to 2019 are correct. Looking at the figures from 2015 to 2019 from the Federal Statistical Office on the number of hospitalizations for depression in children and adolescents, they agree with the figures in the article “More hospitalizations of children with depression.” So the factcheck seems to be correct. What is the relation of Covid 19 to the numbers? The article gives the impression that it’s not a Covid 19 related phenomenon. But the Federal Statistical Office only talks about the numbers from 2015 to 2019. Covid 19 appeared in Germany at the beginning of 2020. To see the development of the numbers of children and adolescents who have depression related to Covid 19, the numbers from 2020 are needed. Prof. Dr. Michael Kölch pointed out that the figures from 2020 cannot yet be available in their entirety, as it always takes about two years to record such figures. Therefore the published figures of the study from 2015 to 2019 can not be compared with the figures of 2020. In order to be able to make the statement that there was already before Covid 19 an increase of depressions of children and young people, the numbers should be compared with each other. Conclusion The statement that there was an increase before the Corona pandemic is right. But considering that the figures since the beginning of the pandemic are still unknown the comparison should not be drawn. The article allows the conclusion that Covid 19 doesn’t have such an impact on hospitalizations of children with depression as assumed. But as Prof. Dr. Michael Kölch pointed out a further increase related to Covis 19 is to be expected. In short: The fact that the author gives the correct numbers of children and adolescents with depression from 2015 to 2019 is mostly true. There has been an increase, but it cannot with certainty be linked to Covid 19.

She stated that the overall payments added up to almost 20 billion Euros, twice as much as France has paid. The claim turns out to be mostly true. According to Alice Weidel, the German share in the EU budget has never been that high. Compared to the other members of the EU, Germany is the country which pays the biggest amount of money to support the union. Nevertheless, the statement should be questioned, because Alice Weidel leaves aside the advantages, that the EU provides the member states. The EU budget records all of the EU’s finances. Unlike a national budget, which purpose mainly is to finance social security systems, the EU-budget targets the financing of all strategies that are politically important to enforce the programs of the European Union.  Alice Weidel, German right-wing populist stated on Twitter: “Almost 20 billion Euros went to Brussels in 2020 – twice as much as France paid.” (Source: Twitter @Alice_Weidel) The sum mostly consists of duties on imports from third countries, a share of the gross national income (GNI) and a small part of the value added tax (VAT) of each member state. The size of those shares is based on the wealth of every country. In addition to that, there are a few other minor ways of income like custom duties or fines payed by companies that oppose the EU rules. How the EU budget is calculated As stated before, the countries have to pay different amounts of money to finance the union, based on the country’s wealth. For many years now, the European Commission has been publishing an annual overview of the EU budget. Up to and including 2019 this overview has shown the net balance of contributions to and repayments from the EU budget for every member state, both in absolute Euro amounts and as a percentage of the respective gross national income (GNI). Since 2020, these figures are no longer published which has led to confusion and various figures being communicated in the mass media. This confusion arises from the fact that there are several ways to calculate those net balances and to find out how much every state has been contributing.  Alice Weidel chose the easiest way to figure out how high Germany’s and France’s payments have been. She set off the spendings against the revenues.  The Website of the European Commission reveals that Germany paid a total of 31.93€ billion and got a return of 12.56€ billion. So, the net sum of payments is 19.37€ billion. In comparison to that, France’s net total comes out to be 9.49€ billion. The fact that France only contributes half of what Germany does, confirms the statement of Alice Weidel as yet. However, this simple comparison of contributions and repayments does not correspond to the method traditionally used by the European Commission to calculate net balances. The traditionally used method leaves out some figures in the calculations. The Commission justifies this on the grounds that although some of the spendings and revenues can be attributed to individual countries, they still benefit all Member States and are therefore not taken into account. The results of this method are called operating budgetary balances and could be slightly different to those that Alice Weidel stated. Since the European Commission did not publish their figures for 2020 they cannot be compared directly. Senior Economist Dr. Berthold Busch states in an article about this matter that looking at the different contributions of the member states, there are many reasons to use the European Commission’s method of calculation. He stresses that those figures, especially the percentage of the GNI, would be most representative.  A tweet without context Overall, there are two reasons to not to categorize Weidel’s statement as true: As Berthold Busch stated, her method of calculation is not the most representative one. Although she used correct figures to mirror the payments, Weidel could have been more precise. Furthermore, the way she makes use of these figures could be misleading. According to her, 19.37€ billion have been transferred to Brussels. Strictly speaking, that part of the statement is incorrect, because the original payment was 31.93€ billion. Still, set off against the returns of 12.56€ billion, the total amount sums up to be almost 20€ billion. De facto, her statement is not totally incorrect, it just could have been more precise. Second of all, Weidel uses the figures without giving more context, to justify the voices supporting the so-called “Dexit” getting louder. Reading between the lines, the tweet gives the impression that the EU is a waste of money and financed only by Germany. She does not take any account of the benefits each member state is taking from the alliance. Weidel only focuses on communicating the figures to justify the goal of her political party to support the “Dexit”.  She leaves out that the EU vastly benefits the economics of its member states and that those benefits cannot only be measured by calculating direct budget transactions. There is a lot more to it.  While researching for this fact check, the EU-Commission stated: “All Member States benefit from being part of the single market, addressing the challenges of migration and fighting terrorism and climate change together […]. Countries will benefit considerably from the effects of investments in other Member States, as they can export more in those countries.” Especially Germany profits from its central location in the single EU Market and easy entries to all countries. To stress how important the alliance is for Germany, Senior Economist Dr. Berthold Busch refers to the German Bundesbank, which published figures of the export and import of German goods. In 2020 goods in a total amount of 634.7€ billion have been exported. He uses those figures to show that there are a lot of benefits that are not considered in Weidel’s calculations. Conclusion All those statements show why Weidel’s tweet should not be categorized as completely true.

He also said that since he is in charge the money Austria spends in this section has increased tenfold. If you look at the big picture, Austria provides way less help than other countries. Yet, his statement is true. Sebastian Kurz is an Austrian politician that appeared on the political landscape for the first time once he became the minister of foreign affairs back in 2013. Since then, his popularity and power has risen continually. He reached the peak of his political career in 2017 when he became the chancellor of Austria. However, on the 9th of October 2021 he resigned as the chancellor and is now the chairman of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP). When Kurz attended the last “Summer Talks’ at the TV-channel ORF, the Afghanistan crisis had taken place just a few weeks before, and it became one of the main topics in the interview. When he was asked if Austria is providing enough help for humanitarian aid, Kurz claimed that Austria is providing a disproportionately large contribution to humanitarian aid, and that since he is in charge it has increased tenfold. But was he right? The claim itself can be divided into two parts. First, is Austria really spending over one billion euros on development cooperation and humanitarian aid? The Austrian ministry for European and international affairs provided a forecast that in 2020 the amount of money Austria would spend on Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be at 1,113 billion euros. The ODA includes all Austrian official development aid from the federal, states and local governments. These numbers are also published by the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. So, about the first part of his claim, Kurz was indeed right. However, he not only talked about the amount of money itself, but he also stated that since he was in office the value has increased tenfold. Again, he was right with his claim, the value did increase tenfold since he became minister in 2013, but the numbers he stated were only about the budget of the Foreign Disaster Fund which is only a small part of the whole ODA number. So, what is the Foreign Disaster Fund? It is mainly used for the immediate management of a crisis as well as for rehabilitation measures and reconstruction. They are mostly awarded to international organizations or Austrian non-governmental organizations by the Austrian Development Agency or the Foreign Ministry itself. So, speaking about the Foreign Disaster Fund only, the numbers are right. They were published by the official site of the Austrian development agency. Back in 2013, the budget was at 4,85 million and was used mostly for providing help in Syria, in 2021 the budget stands at 52,5 million euros so it did increase tenfold but as we explained earlier it is only a small part of the whole ODA budget. There was a high increase in the budget of the Foreign Disaster Fund, but it was originally unplanned and resulted from a conflict between the two governing parties over the refugee camps on Moria: Because the ÖVP was against the admission of refugees, the Greens wrested the increase from the coalition partner. Green leader Werner Kogler had also pointed out this increase in his “Summer Talk” and described it as an achievement of the green government work.  Conclusion Although what Kurz said was right, it is interesting to look at the big picture. Austria is indeed giving more than a billion on humanitarian aid and development cooperation, but the budget in that sector has not increased tenfold. That applies only on the budget of the Foreign Disaster Fund. Therefor, we rate Sebastian Kurz’s claim as mostly true.

Based on a recent Canadian study (Statistics Canada) , legalization resulted in more cannabis use in the country. Canada being the only country in the world, besides Uruguay, where cannabis is completely legal. Does legalization always result in an augmented use?     It’s hard to give a clear answer to this question as there is no one way of ‘legalizing cannabis’. “It depends on the way a government implements this legalization”, explains Mafalda Pardal, researcher at the Institute for Social Drug Research at Ghent University. “It can go from a system of home cultivation all the way to a full commercialization of the drug.” Furthermore, it’s hard to make conclusions about a possible effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the results of the Canadian study.

28,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-more-than-70-percent-of-adults-in-the-eu-are-fully-vaccinated/,„More than 70 percent of adults in the EU are fully vaccinated”,2021-11-04,eufactcheck,,"Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission since 2019, stated on the 15th September 2021 in her speech in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg that more than 70 percent of the European adult population were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This claim turns out to be true. Every September the President of the European Commission gives a speech on the State of the Union. Von der Leyen talks about the achievements of the past year as well as the current priorities and challenges for the upcoming year. Besides climate change and migration, the way the EU handled the pandemic was one of the biggest topics. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen claims, that more than 70 percent of adults in the EU are fully vaccinated.  As the press officer of the European Commission confirms, von der Leyen refers in her speech to numbers published on the COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker which gives an overview on the vaccine development in the European Union (EU) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). It is commissioned by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The ECDC is an agency of the European Parliament that was founded in 2005. Apart from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) it is the second most important health institution in the EU. Every EU member state must report to the Vaccine Tracker The Vaccine Tracker’s data is curated through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). The ECDC refreshes their data on a regular basis from Monday to Friday at 11 AM.  Every country of the EU or the EEA must report all accessible vaccination data at least twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, to the ECDC. In the statistics, the number of doses administered to the total population are divided by the size of the corresponding population. In addition to the Vaccine Tracker, ECDC publishes a weekly report on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA to ensure transparency. Besides accumulated data and figures the report predicts the further course of the pandemic. The report that refers to the week before von der Leyen’s speech (12th September 2021) records 71.3 percent of fully vaccinated people aged 18 years and older. Thus, Ursula von der Leyen quotes the primary source correctly. Our World in Data confirms vaccination rate As already stated, the ECDC is an official agency that distributes their data to other health institutions, which is why it was difficult to find an independent secondary source that didn’t work with or was closely connected to it. Such a source is Our World in Data. The online publication informs about the development in the world and the problems that occur in it. The platform was founded in 2011 as a collaborated effort between the University of Oxford and the non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab. Edouard Mathieu, Head of Data at Our World in Data since 2020 and former data scientist at the University of Oxford, comments with own calculations on the number of fully vaccinated adults in the EU/EEA: “According to our latest data, there were 272,360,373 people aged 12+ fully vaccinated as of 15th September 2021.” Our World in Data uses figures provided by country-specific public official sources. The vaccination data is updated daily and visible to the public on GitHub. In contrast to the ECDC, the online publication doesn’t evaluate the number of fully vaccinated people above the age of 18, but above 12. Because of that, Mathieu utilizes the figures provided by Our World in Data to estimate whether the numbers of fully vaccinated adults in the EU by the ECDC is correct. He explains his calculations as follows: “According to the latest data by the United Nations, there are 392,632,000 people aged 12+ who live in the EU. That gives us a share of full vaccinations of 69.4 percent for individuals aged 12+ in the EU. Given that the 12–17 group should be the least vaccinated among them (with the vaccine being authorized much more recently for teenagers), it is therefore a safe bet to say that the percentage of full vaccinations for adults in the EU was above 69.4 percent on Sep 15, and therefore probably at least 70 percent.”Edouard Mathieu, Head of Data at Our World in Data The difference between the result of Mathieu’s calculations and the numbers of the ECDC can be explained by the varying age groups used in the tracking of vaccinated people. Furthermore, on the 28th May 2021 the EMA approved the COVID-19 vaccines for the age group above 12, which was much later than for adults. The official recommendation to vaccinate minors took place months later, depending on the EU country. For instance, the Ständige Impfkommission (STIKO) made this announcement on the 16th August 2021 in Germany. Even if the calculations of Eduard Mathieu differ slightly from the numbers used by Ursula von der Leyen in her speech, he reviews her statement as “correct”. Conclusion In short, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen claimed on the 15th September 2021 in her annual speech on the State of the Union in front of the European Parliament that more than 70 percent of the adult population in the EU were fully vaccinated. Von der Leyen correctly quotes the numbers from the ECDC COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. With the help of his own calculations and figures, Edouard Mathieu, Head of Data at Our World in Data, comes up with at least 70 percent of fully vaccinated adults in the EU. Despite slight deviations in the numbers due to varying age groups the claim by von der Leyen is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

The news service is referring to an international study that surveyed young people in 10 countries. The claim came out to be mostly true. For the article The Guardian used findings from a study that will soon be officially published. This is the largest study to date, entitled “Young people’s voices on climate anxiety, government betrayal and moral injury: a global phenomenon” and it is a cooperation between nine scientists. According to the study’s introduction it “aimed to better understand the feelings, thoughts and functional impacts associated with climate change among young people globally”. The authors collected data from 10 000 people aged 16-25 years, by using the online survey tool Kantar. The survey took place in 10 selected countries which include the UK, Finland, France, USA, Australia, Portugal, India, Brazil, Philippines, and Nigeria. These countries were chosen to represent different cultures, incomes, climates, climate vulnerabilities, and exposure to differing intensities of climate-related events. A screenshot of the article in which The Guardian refers to the international study about young peoples voices on climate change, 4 November 2021. How do young people feel due to climate change? In general, the study analyzed climate-related anxiety, worry, functional impact, emotions, and thoughts. Furthermore, they asked how climate change and the current responses of their government impact their trust in the government. For example, 65 percent of the participants claim they feel that their government is failing young people. In the study itself, the data summarized that “many endorsed a range of negative emotions, with over 50 percent of respondents saying they had felt afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty”. One of the questions was whether the participants are hesitant to have children because of climate change. In the chart below you can see the respective distribution of the responses in each country. ©Paulina Bombel | Jade University of Applied Sciences Datasource: Young people’s voices on climate anxiety, government betrayal and moral injury: a global phenomenon | University of Bath A clear result… but not a clear result In an interview Elouise E. Mayall, one of the authors of the study and a master student in Ecology, explained that due to the study the claim is correct. But she made clear that she and her colleagues avoided the term “global”. Although the study was large and tried to be as representative as possible of the whole world, it is still not possible to make a general statement about it. Because of limited money for the study or the fact that not all young people have access to a computer and internet, it is impossible to talk about a global percentage of 39 percent who fear having children due to climate crisis. Young people are more anxious about the future Emma Lawrance, Mental Health Innovations Fellow at Institute of Global Health Innovation, and co-author of the briefing paper “The impact of climate change on mental health and emotional wellbeing: current evidence and implications for policy and practice” states that “people who are more worried about climate change and the environment, and the corresponding impacts on humanity, sometimes feel this so strongly that it impacts their decisions on having children”. However “the reported numbers of 40 percent of young people being hesitant to have children because of climate change is really high”. Therefore one can say that the climate crisis and the corresponding anxiety have a clear connection to thoughts about the future and the willingness to have children. This stands in favor of the truthfulness of the claim. Conclusion Like Dr. Emma Lawrance stated: “This study is the largest of its kind to date, and more international than other studies of its kind. However, of course there are caveats that this may not be the final number representing how young people feel across the whole world.” Therefore the claim can be considered true regarding the study but from a global perspective, however, the claim is only mostly true.

She claimed that high income countries have received more than 80% of the vaccinations in comparison to low income countries who obtained only 0.3%. The claim turns out te be mostly true. The newssite CNBC and the United Nations also covered this topic in an article, but they use different percentages than Fleming. While Melissa Fleming talks about the percentages being 0.3% and more than 80%, CNBC and the UN claim the percentages are 0.2% and 87% with headlines such as “Low-income countries have received just 0.2 per cent of all COVID-19 shots given” and “WHO says more than 87% of the world’s Covid vaccine supply has gone to higher-income countries.” Where is the source?  Both Fleming’s tweet and the articles have the same source, namely the World Health Organization (WHO). After active, extensive research, no articles on this topic could be found on the organization’s website. Subsequently, another Twitter post by the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, occured. This tweet was about a WHO press conference on this topic and was able to provide further information as well as identifying the primary source. Conclusively, this was a transcription of the WHO press conference of May 9th 2021. The press conference On April 9th 2021, WHO released a transcription of the press conference on coronavirus disease. Starting at minute 00:03:07, the statement dropped: “More than 700 million doses of vaccine were administered worldwide, but more than 87% went to high- or upper-middle-income countries, while low-income countries received only 0.2%.” Thus, the question arises as to how the different percentages in Under Secretary General Melissa Fleming’s post could have occurred. On purpose or by accident? It’s possible that Melissa Fleming posted these numbers by accident, a little typo creeps in quickly. But at a later point in the research, another tweet from Melissa on the same topic popped up with the same ‘wrong’ percentages. So maybe not a typo? An inquiry to WHO asking if it was possible that Ms. Fleming was basing her statement on other research findings was not followed by a response to date. A further enterprise was started to obtain an expert opinion on the vaccination doses administered worldwide, but this has also been unsuccessful so far. According to Dr. Ulrike Schleier, Professor of Statistics at Jade University in Germany, the difference in the figures could have occurred for different reasons. Fleming may not have used the press release as a source but checked the databases of the UN which are based on the WHO data, possibly at a different time. “The WHO press release dates April 9, 2021, whereas the statement by Melissa Fleming is from May 11, 2021. In the meantime, the figures might have changed. There might also have been later corrections in the states’ reports. The percentages are, in any case, only estimates based on the numbers of inhabitants, which are also only estimated. In reality, the number of inhabitants in a country is not known on a daily basis. Finally, the WHO and the UN might have different definitions of what a “high income” or a “low income” country is. All of these factors might lead to slight differences in such numbers”, assumes Schleier. Also read the related blog post The possible accuracy of global coved vaccination numbers.  Conclusion No statement can be made about the background of Melissa Fleming’s statement at this point, but the fact check can be declared mostly true due to the minimal deviations of the values compared to official data.

It states that Belgium is one of the largest deforesters in Europe, per capita. The claim turns out to be mostly true. Belgium is indeed one of the European countries contributing most to tropical deforestation with 14 m²/year per capita deforestation. Only the Netherlands surpasses Belgium with 18 m²/year per capita deforestation. To know why Belgium contributes so much to the deforestation of the “lungs of the earth”, we have to look at its food industry and port activity. Heading of the article on the website of De Morgen, 14 April 2021 Belgium has a long history in the food industry. Ever since the colonial era, Belgium has been an importer (Dutch) of various exotic raw materials such as palm oil and cocoa. “Belgium has thus a lot of experience with commodities that are responsible for a great part of deforestation today”, says Bart Muys, professor of forest ecology and forest management at the KU Leuven, Belgium. “These products are also important to the Belgian food industry. They are often products that serve as animal feed.” Export But Belgium also exports many of its products resulting from its food industry. “This raises the question whether the responsibility for deforestation caused by such products should not fall to the country of the final consumer”, adds Professor Muys. Thanks to its ports, Belgium could and can import and export more easily. The port of Antwerp has a lot of port activity. Different goods first pass through Belgium, also goods that cause deforestation. And that is also a reason why Belgium can seem to be a major cause of deforestation. Conclusion Belgium is technically one of the largest deforesters in the EU, second after The Netherlands. This is mainly due to the large port activity and the food industry. But who is ultimately responsible for deforestation is difficult to determine, because many of the final products are exported again. So the claim is mostly true.

According to a Deutsche Welle article, Catherine Woolard (director of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles) said that asylum decision-making in Europe even resembles a lottery game, meaning that people often end up being rejected even though they need protection. By researching hard and soft factors, this claim can be evaluated as “mostly true”. Since the refugee crisis in 2015, the accommodation of people in need of aid has been a global problem. In doing so, states even within the EU are taking very different approaches. Germany  In Germany, there is a clearly defined procedure for filing an asylum application. An asylum request must be submitted promptly after arrival. After that, people are distributed within Germany. Once in the allocated area, a personal application must be filed with the Federal Office for Migration & Refugees. If the initial examination determines that Germany is not responsible for the person for various reasons, the person is rejected and sent directly back to the home country, even if it is unsafe. If Germany is responsible, a personal consultation follows, which in turn is followed by a decision under various applicable laws. If the decision is positive, a residence permit is issued. If the decision is negative, the person concerned can appeal against it, which can be followed by another negative or positive decision. In case of a second negative decision, the person is supposed to be deported, at least according to the rules. Croatia In Croatia, for example, according to Croatian Law on International and Temporary Protection, international protection in Croatia may be requested by a person who is a third- country national or a stateless person. Asylum will be granted to an applicant who is outside the country of his nationality or habitual residence and has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. If these conditions are not met, the applicant for protection may be granted subsidiary protection if there are justifiable reasons that indicate that returning to the country of origin will face a real risk of suffering serious injustice. The applicant is obliged to cooperate with the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia, which decides on the request. France In France, the French Office of Immigration (OFFI) has the authority to decide whether to confirm, suspend or even re-suspend confirmations for asylum seekers based on defined misconduct. Importantly, asylum applications must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of entry. Among other things, applicants may not refuse accommodation, an assigned place or leave their assigned area without permission. In addition, if they submit a request for reconsideration or are unable to meet a deadline during their procedure, the OFFI may decide to suspend the application or confirmation. Comparison between the EU countries in numbers To more objectively illustrate the differences within various EU countries, the following countries were compared regarding their numbers of accepted and rejected refugees over the last two years. In Germany, 1,839,115 people were in need of protection in 2019. In 2020, only 145,071 people applied for asylum. Of these people, about one-third were rejected (32,1%) which means that 46,586 people in total were rejected after applying for asylum in 2020. In addition, 10,800 people were deported in 2020, most of whom were from Albania, Georgia and Serbia. In Croatia, between the years 2017 and 2020, 6.173 migrants have applied for international protection. Of them 676 were granted international protection (616 asylum, 60 subsidiary protection) which is nearly 11%, according to the Ministry of the Interior. The remaining number of applications was either suspended by the person requesting international protection or rejected by the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia. In 2019, 47.5% of decisions on the suspension of the procedure from 1986 applications for international protection were recorded, according to the Annual Report on Migration and Asylum for the Republic of Croatia for 2019. Thus, during 2020, 1932 asylum applications were submitted, but 1675 of them – which is 87% – were suspended by migrants. Some other examples: In France, the French government decided to accept 7,886 refugees in 2020 and 14,066 in 2019. The number of asylum applications was 62,067 in 2020 and 95,577 in 2019. France rejected 80.20% of all applicants in 2020 and 79% in 2019. In overall figures, this implies that France rejected 56,172 refugees in 2020 and 73,046 in 2019. Even though the rejection rate is high, denied people still apply for an extension later. As a result, they are later usually granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status. The number of total deportations is unknown, but 53,273 people were detained in 2019. Special attention should be paid to the automatic loss of the right of residence in France: When the French Office for Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) makes a decision of ineligibility, the person withdraws their asylum application. But if the OFPRA decides to close the application, the person is subject to a definitive deportation decision. Continuing with Italy, the Italian state accepted 211,446 refugees in 2020 compared to 207,602 in 2019. There was no data regarding the asylum application for 2020, but in 2019, 43,783 people applied for asylum in Italy. Unfortunately, data on rejections is also missing for 2020, but 81% of refugees were rejected in 2019. This means a total of 35,464 rejected refugees this year. In addition, 53,273 people were detained in 2020. Generally, asylum seekers can be granted either refugee status or subsidiary international protection status. Deportation and repatriation proceedings are regulated by national legislation. Greece In Greece, refugees have to report immediately upon arrival in order to be registered as an asylum seeker. Once the procedure has started, there are two options. Either a regular procedure is applied, and the person is granted asylum for a maximum of 6 months, or the accelerated procedure is applied, where the asylum is only valid for 30 days. If the application is rejected the person can also appeal the decision. In addition, there is a fast-track border procedure which regulates the applications of refugees on the Eastern Aegean island, who are, in contrast, subject to the Turkey statement. This fast-track variant is intended to reduce and also shorten the administrative workload with refugees. However, it is more difficult for refugees because they have to understand the system even quicker. Conclusion DW’s statement that being a refugee is like playing the lottery can be partially agreed with. On the one hand, it is true that the strategy of the receiving country determines whether a person is accepted or not. On the other hand, in nations with many admitted refugees, it can be observed that many other factors play a role. We would not equate the refugee process with a lottery, but Woolard’s statement is not wrong either, as it definitely takes luck to be treated fairly in a given country. Most importantly, the definition of when a person is considered in need of assistance makes the entire process very opaque.

33,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-the-roar-of-traffic-and-aircraft-are-linked-to-negative-health-effects/,“The roar of traffic and aircraft are linked to negative health effects”,2021-06-19,eufactcheck,,"On 16 March 2021, BBC Online reported on negative health effects linked to noise pollution. The article claims that living near an airport or motorway has been shown to have a negative impact on our health. This is also confirmed by scientists who point to the effects of noise on humans. This claim is true. The author Cypress Hansen, a scientific journalist, published the article originally in Knowable Magazine and republished it in various media, such as BBC Online. Her claim is based on various statistics that prove the specific health effects people get after being exposed to noise. Hansen’s main source is the findings of Thomas Münzel, a cardiologist at the University Medical Center of Mainz in Germany. Fig. 1: Screenshot of the examined BBC Article. (Source: BBC Online) The article states that traffic noise was considered one of the major physiological stressors, right after air pollution and about the same as exposure to second-hand smoke and radon. This can be confirmed by the 2011 study of Hänninen and Knol, in which traffic noise was classified in group 2 of the most important environmental risk factors. In 2017, Münzel et al. also confirmed the influence of noise on psychological processes.                                                                         Furthermore, several studies confirm that unhealthy noise exposure starts at 70 db to 80 db. Even more, European and American studies confirm, that in Europe and the USA about one third of the population is exposed to such high noise levels. Night-time noise pollution Hansen claims, that citizen “living near the Frankfurt Airport […] have as much as a 7 % higher risk of stroke than those living in similar but quieter neighbourhoods”. He refers to the results of a case-control study, published in 2018 by Seidler et al. that confirms the claimed information. In addition, he mentions the results of a case-crossover study as reported in the European Heart Journal showing “significant increases in night time mortality after airplane flyovers”. The article on the study by Saucy et al. (2020) confirms this claim. Besides, Hansen claims that the cardiovascular consequences of noise are physiologically based on changes in the endothelium. This refers to a study of Schmidt et al. from 2013 in which they “found evidence for significant impairment of endothelial function after only one night of aircraft noise exposure”. When this inner lining of arteries and blood vessels (endothelial) is damaged, “cells that should remain in the blood [get „activated“ and] can pass through the blood vessels into the adjacent body tissue.” (Rajendran et al. 2013). Fig. 2: Impact of noise (Source: Münzel et al. 2019) It also describes the path from sound to blood vessels and mentions the auditory cortex and the amygdala in this context. This refers to the study by Münzel et al. from 2019, explaining the pathway of noise to the amygdala, dividing it into an indirect pathway, “in which lower levels of noise disturb sleep”, and the direct pathway, where higher noise was linked with increased stress-associated limbic (amygdalar) activity. Cardiovascular diseases Also, Hansen claims that this happens even if the person is not aware of it. According to Münzel’s 2014 study, there is no “significant association for day-time noise, but a significant increase in blood pressure in night noise”. According to Hansen, stress reactions have a major impact on the entire body. Adrenaline and cortisol trigger various processes in the body: Blood pressure rises , arteries constrict and sugars and fats are released into the bloodstream. These symptoms are consistent with the results of Eriksson and Pershagen from 2018, who studied the biological mechanisms associated with cardiovascular and metabolic effects from environmental noise. The article states that stress promotes the formation of harmful molecules that cause oxidative stress and inflammation of the blood vessels. As a result, blood flow is impaired and this affects many other dangerous processes, causing hypertension, atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes. We were able to verify this statement given in the primary source with a medical article by Sun et al. 2020 as an alternative source. Everyone is at equal risk Hansen also claims that night-time aircraft noise is not only a concern for people who are already at risk of heart and metabolic problems. The claim is based on a blinded field study, that exposed people to two noise scenarios and a control sample. The study shows that severe exposure to aircraft noise at night impairs endothelial function and stimulates adrenaline release, even in people without health conditions. A 2019 study from Münzel et al. confirms the negative impact of night-time noise on healthy people: it shows that nocturnal railway noise is almost directly associated with impaired blood vessel function. According to Münzel et al., even young people are affected by endothelial dysfunction after just one night. In general, it can be confirmed that noise, especially traffic noise, is one of the strongest environmental factors that can permanently deteriorate a person’s health, regardless of age. However, a study showing that endothelial dysfunction occurs after just one night has not been found. Kohlhuber & Bolte (2011) also illustrate that it is only over a longer period of time that cardiovascular dysfunction occurs. Before these symptoms, those affected first suffer from a flattening of the depth of sleep or various psychosomatic symptoms. The fact that these dysfunctions also occur in younger people can be confirmed. Sleep deprivation or prolonged exposure to noise is harmful in every age group, according to an article on aerzteblatt.de. Nevertheless, effects such as a heart attack or stroke are more likely to occur in conjunction with poor eating habits, smoking and/or alcohol consumption. With an extra quote, Hansen underlines that “Western Europeans are collectively losing more than 1.6 million years of healthy life because of traffic noise”. He refers to a 2018 report by the WHO, which in turn make this claim with reference to the EU Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC). The fact is confirmed by the primary source, even though the explanation of the calculation of the claimed figure is not traceable. Conclusion In short, scientific journalist Hansen claims in the BBC Online article, first published in Knowable Magazine, that noise pollution is associated with various negative health effects. The article is based on several scientific studies that show the various effects of noise on the human body. All primary sources are traceable and confirm, except for one calculated figure, the claimed health effects triggered by traffic and aircraft noise. In conclusion, the claim is true.

34,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-without-immigration-economic-growth-risks-being-undermined/,"“Without immigration, economic growth risks being undermined”",2021-06-18,eufactcheck,,"“The corona crisis has reduced migration flows worldwide. That has implications for prosperity. In rich countries, economic growth without immigration risks being undermined.” This claim from the German statistical bureau Destatis, published in Belgian newspaper De Standaard from 10 February 2021, turns out to be mostly true. Immigration is a global phenomenon with Europe as the largest reception area for international migrants according to the United Nations International Migration Report. There where major refugee crises in recent years, which has given the word migration a rather negative undertone. Yet migration has a positive impact on all the countries of Europe. “The claim is correct in theory”, says Ive Marx professor of socio-economics at the Antwerp University (UA). “Immigration does provide a boost in the economy. On the other hand, in practice it is much more complicated. There are many different immigrants. The ones that make a difference to our economy are mainly the migrant workers.” Claim in De Standaard, 10 February 2021: In rich countries the economic growth risks to be undermined without immigration because of ageing and labour shortages.” A United Nations report states, “If supported by appropriate policies, international migration can contribute to inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development.” The National Bank of Belgium‘s results are also positive: “Recent immigration has had a positive impact on gross domestic product. GDP has increased by 3.5% in Belgium. 2% of this is because of the EU migrants and the other 1.5% is due to non-EU migrants.” Here we have to keep in mind that according to the National Bank, Belgium performs very poorly in receiving and employing migrants. It can be concluded from this that European countries that perform best also have a larger increase. Clear effects Many of these migrant workers are already being trained in their countries to do bottleneck jobs in other countries. This is called the GSP project or Global Skill Partnership that Belgium is participating in according to Enabel, a Belgian development agency. This provides a higher level of education allowing recent migrants to contribute more, says the ecorev report from the National Bank of Belgium. Second-generation migrants also contribute more to the economy than first-generation migrants. This has to do with education but also with language skills. Ive Marx: “Corona has a surprisingly small impact on labour migration within Europe. Outside Europe it is more difficult to determine because of the difficult vaccination there.” COVIVAT, a collaboration between three socio-economic research groups from Belgian universities, comes up with the same conclusion: “Migratory movements from non-EU countries are therefore expected to have been harder hit than migratory movements from EU countries.” They also clearly state that they can only see clear effects of the COVID-19 crisis later. Conclusion After reports from the National Bank of Belgium, COVIVAT, the United Nations and the insights of Ive Marx, we can conclude that immigration does indeed have an impact on the economic growth of a country. In rich countries, immigrants are used skillfully, by employing them in bottleneck occupations. Yet, according to Marx, the claim is too general because the impact on the economy depends on what kind of migrants migrate.

How come nothing came out of bats in last thousand years but only yesterday?” he mentioned. The claim turns out to be false.WHO-convened global study about origins of SARS-Cov-2, researches test different claims related to Covid-19 virus geneses. It is concluded that in order to check the aforementioned claim, all high-facility biosecurity laboratories of the world should be investigated. According to the same report, bats have been identified as the hosts of a series of important zoonotic viruses (for example, Nipah virus, Hendra virus and SARS-CoV), including coronaviruses with considerable genetic diversityScientists have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) were caused by viruses that originated in bats, with other animals serving as intermediate hosts, flying mammals are considered the reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2 as well.27 world scientists published a joint-statement in Lancet journal, stating that the claims distributed  about Covid- 19 has political motives and the virus was originated from nature. They did so in defense of Chinese scientists, healthcare workers, and public intellectuals.  “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” scientists say. Besides, the U.S. National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases notified that Covid-19 belongs to a virus family that is contagious among humans and animals. WHO’s study also acknowledges that possible source of the virus is exotic animal markets located in Wuhan, China. Eddie Holmes, virologist from the University of Sydney, also supported the idea, saying that virus was transmitted from animal to human. Another study by WHO from early during pandemic also stated that facts collected so far at that point do not corroborate that the virus was produced in a laboratory. “All facts lead to a conclusion that the virus is animal-origin. Researchers who studied the genetics of the virus believe that it doesn’t look like a sort came out of laboratory,” the report says.  ConclusionIn conclusion, there is an evidence that infections have been originated from the bats in the past, but there is no proof that the virus was produced in a laboratory, however, more investigation is needed in order to better understand the origins of the virus. Thus, the MP’s claim was false.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Heydar Isayev, GIPA’s Caucasus School of Journalism and Media Management Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

36,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-99-of-landings-from-eu-managed-stocks-are-sustainably-fished/,99% of landings from EU-managed stocks are sustainably fished,2021-06-02,eufactcheck,,"On the 4th of February 2021, Europêche released a statement on their website that claimed 99% of the landings from EU-managed stocks were fished sustainably. Research shows the claim is mostly false. Europêche is an organization representing vessels and fishermen from ten European countries. They promote fluent communication between the European institutions and the fishing sector. Despite representing the fishing sector, Europêche has affiliations with the Union Armateurs Pêche de France (UAPF), which is registered as a lobby group. Moreover, Europêche has affiliations with Cluster Maritime Française with members such as ADAM assurances, AXA, BNP Paribas Fortis and Deter Oil.  Europêche’s response After contacting the organisation, Europêche’s policy advisor Rosalie Tukker referred to a European report that mentioned the percentage of landings from EU-managed and sustainably fished stocks. The report’s introduction mentions that in 2019 “almost 100% of the landings from fish stocks exclusively managed by the EU were at maximum-sustainable-yield level.”  A report published by the European Commission in June 2020 says that it “is expected that in 2020 more than 99% of the landings in the Baltic, North Sea and the Atlantic managed exclusively by the EU will come from sustainably managed fisheries.” This report is a summary of what has been reported by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STEFC). Maximum sustainable yield In an e-mail, Ann-Katrien Lescauwaert from the Flanders Marine Institute mentions that we can analyze the landings from EU-managed stocks and their sustainability by looking at the maximum sustainable yield assessments. The fishing stocks, landing obligations and the methodology used to calculate maximum sustainable yield are reported by several institutions such as the Common Fisheries Policy from the European Commission.  To consider fishing stocks as sustainable, the total allowed catch (TAC) needs to be in line with or below the maximum sustainable yield as mentioned by the European Union. “It is important to note that the European system which calculates the total allowed catches (TAC) only use data from commercially exploited species for which a formal and full assessment is available”, Ann-Katrien Lescrauwaet mentions.  However, the total allowed catches (TAC) do not include the discard or the bycatches, which should be, according to the international advocacy organisation Oceana. Likewise, the European environment agency’s report ‘The European environment-state and outlook 2020’ states that “bycatches of marine mammals, seabird and non-commercial fish is still a major threat for our environment”. A review by the European Commission and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) focusing on the landing obligations and its implications for fisheries published via the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) shows that discarding “is a common practice in fisheries. Total discards are estimated to be about 30 million tons, representing around 23% of worldwide catches.” Moreover, the European Commission estimates the discards from commercial fishing around seven to ten million tons. These discards have a big impact on the ecosystems and contribute to overfishing in the Europe. The total discards could be even higher than what is reported. These numbers do not take into account the number of discards which are not documented, such as the illegal, unreported and unregulated discards.  This shows that if the discards and the bycatches in the calculation of the TAC’s method are included, the results of sustainably fished catches in the European Union will most likely differ. In other words, not including the data on discards in the total amount of catches might influence the results. These missing numbers pose a threat to the accuracy of the reports by the European institutions. Transparant reports To monitor the maximum sustainable yield and the total allowed catches (TAC), there needs to be full transparency from member states and fishing vessels, since both the European Commission and the European Council rely on data collected by member states for their reports. Transparency is necessary to determine if the reports are accurate and to ensure a proper decision-making process. However, transparency is not always guaranteed. “The majority of the TAC-setting process, takes place behind closed doors”, environmental law charity ClientEarth writes, “This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for stakeholders to participate in the process, identify which Member State have advocated for unsustainable TAC’s, or hold them to account.” Likewise, the European Environment Agency shows that the European seas still faces big challenges in the ability to assess fishing stocks. It shows that an assessment was only possible for 6,5% of the total landings from the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea between 2016 and 2018. For the North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, it was possible for 36%. This shows that the results in many European reports about the level of sustainably fished catches are not complete enough to have a clear view of the European seas as a whole. Lastly, a study by two professors from the Heriot-Watt University, shows that we need to take European vessels fishing outside of European water into account. Nearly one third of the European catches stem from outside EU-waters. Those catches are set by agreements between different countries, called partner states. Agreements made between the European Union and partner countries are only possible if some criteria are respected. However, this study shows that those agreements and its monitoring have been problematic. According to the study, some cases have brought up questionable practices. For example, a partner country “cannot fish far offshore because their local vessels cannot reach far fishing ground. Although the EU pays for an access to this inaccessible water”, and that makes sense, the study shows it isn’t always fair and sustainable. Conclusion The claim is mostly untrue, because it neglects the bigger picture. The European Union could use a more accurate methodology when calculating the total allowed catches (TAC), which is a key parameter to calculate the level of sustainability. According to Oceana, the “TAC system is not working correctly because scientific advice is being systematically ignored.” Oceana estimates around 78% of the scientific recommendations have been ignored.  As our research shows, one can wonder if the results would be different if the numbers of bycatches and discards would be included. Moreover, data was not collected on all the landings managed by the European Union, which results in some blank areas.

Her post, comprising at first a positive note regarding the increasing entrepreneurial spirit and the ascending nature of the average wage earned in Romania, also took a stand on poverty, social inequalities triggered by the striking deficiencies in the national economy and on the issue of the pensions which do not reflect the level of committed work performed by a Romanian employee throughout his lifetime. Raluca Turcan has been a durable presence in the National Liberal Party and has tackled similar, economic-oriented issues, proposing throughout time several alternatives for the revival and reconstruction of the Romanian economic sector: prolonging the duration of the professional life until 70 years old or the attempt of reducing the incessant bureaucratization, in regards to the unessential documents, in the small companies via the introduction of the electronic signature. One of her latest endeavours in the economic sector comes from the 29th of March 2021, when she pleaded her minister’s 5 potential variants in order to reconfigure the special pension system from Romania. “There are approximately 90,000 Romanians who have reached retirement age and who do not even have access to the minimum social pension, because they do not have the minimum contribution period of 15 years,” reads the official statement given by the politician herself via a press release. “Poverty remains a major problem in Romania and the value of work in Romania – 8 euros/hour is more than 3 times lower than the EU average – 28 euro/hour, and in-work poverty is almost twice as high in Romania – almost 15 % compared to the EU average – 8%,” reads fragmentary, yet essential part from her lengthy and comprehensive post. The statement extracted from her Facebook post is also infused with the troublesome status quo of the economic sector in Romania. The assertion is divided between two different directions: in-work poverty and the value of work. Both these trajectories are worthy of a closer investigation in terms of accuracy. Due to some inexact numbers infused in this post, this claim turned out to be only mostly true, with minor errors infiltrating themselves.  Regulation and statistical data upon wage in Romania In Romania, the minimum wage is mandated by the Government. According to article 112 of the Labour Code, the pre-imposed, normal work schedule for a full-time employee is of 8 hours per day, amounting to 40 hours per week. The Government decision implies that the minimum wage is calculated on 168 average working hours her month. The minimal working wage per hour in 13.58 lei, the raw and approximated equivalent of 2.76 euros. In 2019, an inquiry into the minimal wage obtained in European countries by European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions was rather revelatory for Romania, as the country where the monthly wage barely 400 euros was incapacitated to compare itself with other strongly founded economies such as Luxembourg (minimal wage of 2,201.93 euros per month), the Netherlands (minimal wage of 1,684.80 euros per month) or Belgium (minimal wage of 1,675.72 euros per month). These results, at their finest, are already a sombre provision of the detrimental place the value of work in Romania occupies. Indeed, according to a scientific survey realized by Eurostat in 2020, the average hourly cost of labour was 28.5 euros across the European Union, with a severe pendulation between Bulgaria, with a low rate of 6.5 euros and Denmark, with the apogee of 45.8 euros as average. Romania, trailing towards the end of the ranking, is allotted an average hourly wage of 8.1 euros, which accounts to 3.5 times lower than the average encapsulated by the European Union. All the sectors are impacted the same, with the wage rates only subtly differentiated: business economy, 7.7 euros per hour, industry, 7.3 euros per hour, construction, 6.2 euros per hour, services, 8.3 euros per hour, non-business (excluding public administration), 10.1 euros per hour.

Source: Eurostat Figure 2: The tangible differences between Romania and the European Union, in terms of the average hourly labour. Source: Eurostat A slim but sure increase Although the term of “poverty” does describe with doubtless exactitude the grim and deficient economic situation in Romania, it is of utmost importance to note that the present circumstances are actually an improvement compared to the shabby economy of the last decade. Romania followed the European trend depicted by the report “Employment and Social Developments in Europe”, devised in June 2019. Its contents foreshadow a slow but steady increase into the hourly productivity and thus, its afferent monetary compensation raised with 12%, in comparison to the impetuous 2009, in the aftermath of a global financial crisis. In the study generated by Gaetano D’Adamo, Nora Hesse, Julien Hartley and Nicolae Bîea for the European Commission, the wage dynamics in Romania finds itself on a mounting trajectory. The public wage even managed to keep the same abrupt pace with the private sector, registering a 60% of increase, with the most prolific and palpable development registered in the time span of 2015-2017. “Ad hoc public wage hikes and consecutive increases of the minimum wage, which rose by almost 40% in real terms between end-2015 and end-2017, have been among the drivers of these developments,” pointedly elucidates the study. The rise was more than necessary as at the beginning of 2015, since a staggering 40% of the population was earning the minimum wage and 6.8% were totally unemployed, as unearthed by the National Statistics Institute. Figure 3: An unrushed yet lengthening growth in the monthly average wages in Romania. Source: Eurostat In-work poverty, an everlasting dilemma On the 11th of April 2018, Angela Cristea, head of the European Commission office in Romania declared that “Romania still displays a paradox of social inequality and poverty, while the country’s economic growth stays above the European Union average,” as mentioned by a telling report of World Vision Romania tackling the same problematic labyrinth. According to an entry devised by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the phenomenon of in-work poverty originated in 2008, after a tumultuous and burdening financial crisis. Romania was one of the countries to take the toll the hardest. As a defining terminology, in the vision of Rod Hick and Alba Lanau from Cardiff University, “in-work poverty occurs when a working household’s total net income is insufficient to meet their needs”. In 2017, the report entitled “ESPN Thematic Report on In-work poverty” conceived by Luana Pop for the European Commission, depicted an identical, double-oriented ratio exhibited by Romania and the European Union. Romania had an in-work poverty rate of 17%, duplicating the rate possessed by the European Union, in integrum, of 9.6%. The 2020 Country Report tailored to the pressing needs of Romania, assessing the progress on structural reforms, prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances, measured that in 2018, the in-work poverty rate was 15.3%. This rate supposedly affected mostly vulnerable groups and alienated the economic status of the rural areas. The latest known statistics embolden this binary consideration whilst the lineage of in-work poverty in Romania remains constant. According to the Eurostat Data Browser, 2019 witnessed an in-work poverty rate of 15.7% whereas 2020 beheld a rate of 14.9%. However, the European Union as a whole registered an outlay for 2019 of 9.2%. This percentage is solidly sustained by the same unfaltering consistency, with the rate never going below 9% ever since 2013. With the latest pair of viable considerations from 2019, 15.7% and 9.2%, Romania stands inches away from the threshold of a double amassing. Figure 4: The in-work poverty as suffered by each European country in 2016. Source: Eurostat In this particular case, the term “poverty” is much more suitable, as there is no glimmer of progress, the in-work poverty rate is stuck on the perpetual oblique, with the values only barely shifting. As a further ado, the dismissive factors determining Romania’s economic panorama are multiple and they all conglomerate to create these fuzzy and dense problems. Gabriela Bodea and Emilia Herman, in their scientific study named “Factors behind working poverty in Romania”, prophesize that “low wages generated by an extremely reduced labour productivity represent an important channel of in-work poverty.” Therefore, the linkage between the in-work poverty rate and a shrinking minimum or average wage is even tighter than possibly imagined. Figure 5: The Romanian regions most direly plagued by poverty. Source: European Commission Conclusion  In short, the claim distributed via social media channels by Raluca Turcan is preponderantly true as the numbers mostly match. Even her implying the term “poverty” as both a positive and a negative connotation is an endeavour that underlines the oxymoronic nature of the Romanian economic sector. However, it is vital to mention that the in-work poverty rate for the entire European Union is not consistent with the statistics pertaining to the Eurostat Data Browser from 2019 or from the past 8 years as the rate avoided falling beyond the rigid boundary of 9%. Consequently, this part of the affirmation transmitted by the politician is erroneous. With this mention in hindsight, this is the magnanimous reason why this claim can only be regarded as mostly true.

38,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-europe-is-too-slow-with-the-roll-out-of-5g/,Europe is too slow with the roll-out of 5G,2021-06-02,eufactcheck,,"Last month, Börje Ekhom claimed that “Europe is too slow with the roll-out of 5G” in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde. The CEO of the Swedish networking and telecommunications company Ericsson expects that Europe will need two years to reach the current level of China. Research shows Europe is slower in rolling out 5G. Börje Ekhom mentions his claim with the results of the Ericsson Mobility Report, which is published biannually on the company’s website. “Today, the leaders are China, Australia, South Korea and the USA. Even the Middle East is ahead of Europe”, Ekhom says in Le Monde. “80% of all 5G subscribers are Chinese. The Asian country has moved 11% of its subscribers to 5G, North America 4%. Europe has only moved 1%.” These numbers roughly accord to data to be found on statistics portals such as Statista. However, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the number of 5G subscriptions should not be conflated to mean the number of 5G users. Not every subscriber has a 5G capable device or actual access to a 5G network. On top of that, the number of subscriptions is only one way to measure the deployment of the latest generation of mobile technology. “You can also determine the swiftness of the roll-out based on the speed of the network itself or the area covered with 5G”, Sofie Pollin, telecommunications engineer at the University of Leuven, says in an interview with the editors. The state of 5G It’s difficult to quantify the speed of a country’s 5G network. The download and upload rate of a network differs per operator. Europe itself has over 800 mobile operators, 14 times more than China. When comparing multiple sources, the 5G network of the United States seems to be significantly slower than the European counterpart. Europe’s network then again appears to be slower than the Asian and Middle Eastern net. What does its speed matter if you don’t have access to this new network? T-Mobile, the largest 5G operator in the US, already reaches 85% of the country’s inhabitants. The Chinese government targets full coverage by 2025. In comparison, Europe wants to cover 75% of its population by that same year. Another element to use in order to measure the state of the roll-out, is the number of base stations. In September 2020, the European Round Table for Industry (ERT) and the Global Counsel released a report that shows Europe is lagging behind in both upgrading existing 4G base stations and building new 5G stations. Don’t forget the people By examining these parameters, it becomes clear that Europe is slower with the deployment of 5G. Especially compared to countries such as the US, South Korea and China. Telecom expert Pollin claims the faster roll-out in Asia had to do with the organisation of the Olympic Winter Games of 2018 in Pyeongchang.  Moreover, she believes the Asian countries are doing a better job when it comes to change management. “The Chinese and South Korean public is more willing to accept this transformation than we are. Europe is not making clear enough that 5G is worthwhile”, Pollin says. “Our 4G networks are fast and reliable, which makes us wonder why we need to upgrade.” An additional complication for the European roll-out of 5G is the fragmentation of its operators, Ekhom believes. “None of these companies work on a scale large enough to compete with other countries.” The Ericsson CEO pleads for a framework, to make fusions between operators possible. Yet it’s companies like Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei that sell 5G equipment to mobile operators and that could benefit from larger investments. Too slow? According to Pollin, Europe is not too slow with the roll-out of 5G. “The EU goes entirely for a digital society and is sure that 5G will be vital for the future”, Pollin states. “I don’t think we should accelerate more, trying to catch up. A slower deployment of 5G isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps some of the first flaws will have been dealt with.” Conclusion Based on various parameters, it is right to say that Europe is not the best pupil in class. The deployment of the 5G network is not running as smoothly as in other countries. Nonetheless, this does not directly mean the roll-out is too slow as claimed by Börje Ekhom. It is difficult to predict the potential consequences of a slower progression. Therefore, the claim is mostly true.

This claim is based on an official Frontex press release and turns out to be true. “Though it’s not the whole picture,” says Ciara Bottomley, press officer for Migration at the European Commission. Bay’s statement can be easily misunderstood when someone is not aware of the difference between regular and irregular migrants. Also, note that a migrant is different from a refugee or an asylum seeker. In a European context, an irregular migrant is not originally from the European Union and doesn’t meet the requirements to set foot in, remain and live in an EU Member State. A migrant is a person who has had their residence in a country that is not their birth country for more than one year. A decline in the number of irregular migrants  “The pressure generated by the European migration policy is absolutely unbearable: we must expel all illegal immigrants and close our external borders. Only total firmness will discourage those illegal immigrants who would like to try their luck and will finally allow us to control our migration policy,” said Nicolas Bay during the plenary session. Bay is MEP and a member of the French right-wing party Rassemblement National. According to him, the European migration policy is unbearable and incapable of solving the massive and unmanageable flows at our external borders. But if one looks closely at the statistics of the Frontex press release, the migration picture becomes totally different. The plenary booklet from I&D bundles their members’ statements.Screenshot by Jellen Monsieur In 2020 the number of irregular migrants trying to enter Europe via the outside borders declined compared to previous years. This is in contrast with the image Bay creates. According to the Frontex press release, the main reason for fewer irregular migrants is the pandemic. “It’s noteworthy that it has become more difficult for migrants to reach the EU borders since last year,” says press officer Ciara Bottomley. “This is partially due to COVID-19.” Bottomley also mentions the increase in tension between Turkey and Greece as one reason fewer migrants are reaching the EU external borders. Statistics do not lie Frontex said it was not able to provide us with the concrete data of this press release. “The data in the press release are sent restrictedly to Frontex by the European member states,” clarifies Frontex. In their press release, children contributed to approximately ten per cent of irregular migrants compared to 23 per cent the year before. Also, the number of women decreased to only ten per cent of the irregular migrants, whereas 25 per cent of the total number were women in 2019. Therefore, it is fair to say that the number of men accounted for eight out of ten irregular migrants. Nevertheless, Nicolas Bay’s statement and the press release from Frontex talk only about the situation of irregular migrants. If a person is eligible for asylum to enter Europe, he or she will be counted as a regular migrant and will thus not be included in the mentioned Frontex statistics. Ciara Bottomley explained that one of the reasons men are overrepresented is that men tend to try to get asylum first to be later able to let their family come over as regular migrants legally. This is because of the rough conditions when travelling to Europe. If you look at the overall picture and study the statistics of the European Union of the people who are granted asylum, the ratio is not the same as mentioned in Bay’s statement. The share of women and children is much larger than two out of ten and differs in each Member State. We contacted Nicolas Bay, but he did not respond to our request to elaborate on his statement. Conclusion Therefore, Nicolas Bay’s statement is true, but his statement is only true if you consider the data available about irregular migrants. Therefore we would conclude the statement to be mostly true. If you add the data regarding regular migrants, his statement would not be true anymore.

The claim turns out to be mostly false. Profusa Implantable BiosensorsThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense that develops emerging technologies for military use. The SCMP article states that the agency has “unveiled a chip that it said can detect signs of the new coronavirus in human bodies within minutes when it is implanted under the skin”. After we got in touch with DARPA, it turned out that the chip that the article is referring to is actually the Profusa Implantable Biosensor – a device, that could provide real-time data on how concentrations of different chemicals change in response to illness, injury, or activity in the daily life of the wearer.  Moreover, the agency emphasizes that the Profusa hydrogel is inert, does not have any electrical components, and is of similar material to a contact lens or corneal implant and for these reasons, it cannot be identified as a “chip”. Our correspondence with DARPA via email revealed also that the biosensor is not implanted under the skin, as stated in the article, but worn outside of the skin. These two erroneous assumptions are misleading and can be associated with the vastly disapproved human microchipping. By 2021, there are about 6000 Swedish who have been chipped. EUfactcheck concluded that this is true in a previous fact check. Many employees use them to get into their office buildings, as a gym pass, to buy food from vending machines and even instead of using train tickets. Ben Libberton,  a science communicator based in Stockholm, warns that by having a microchip implanted in your hand, you also give your data away: “The real issue is data handling, which will be an issue later on with how data is stored… if the data is not secure, someone can get your information and once it’s out there, it’s hard to get back.“ However, the question that arises from this new technology would be – is it possible to further develop the microchips to detect and hold information regarding COVID-19 or any future mutations? Does the implant detect COVID-19? The SCMP publication is citing Colonel Matthew Hepburn, who has been a programme manager at DARPA for six years (2013-2018) and has been managing the Profusa Implantable Biosensors project. Interestingly enough, Colonel Matthew Hepburn does not use the words “coronavirus”, “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” in any of the cited statements nor has he used them in the CBS News show 60 Minutes that is said to be the source of information. In addition, the answer that we received from DARPA points out that Profusa first received DARPA funding though a small grant in 2011, obviously well before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. However, the agency says that such a technology could conceivably help to detect the early onset of illness. Therefore, it is possible for the implant to detect COVID-19, but that was not the main purpose of the agency, while developing the technology, since the new coronavirus was not even existing at the early stages of development. Conclusion Taking into account all the data, the statement that the chip, developed by DARPA, can detect signs of COVID-19, when it is implanted under the skin, is mostly false. That claim was made by the CBS News show 60 minutes, then cited in the South China Morning Post. DARPA finds most of the former’s statements inaccurate.

In order to enable tourists, who are responsible for a big part of the Croatian economy, to spend a safe holiday in Croatia, Brnjac’s Ministry recently introduced the “Safe stay in Croatia” label. The health and safety measurements of this campaign and what role they play in Croatia’s preparations for tourists are explained further in another fact-check, done by our Croatian colleagues from the University of Zagreb. “Fewer bookings” over Easter 2021 than in previous years Though the Ministry wants the tourists to feel safe, the current Corona situation is rather critical. Countries like Germany have placed Croatia on their list of high-risk countries. But despite the high incidence of Covid-19 in Croatia, the number of tourists during the Easter holidays 2021 has been a bit higher than last year, as this line chart shows.    As many countries were in a lockdown in the beginning of 2021, the number of tourist arrivals, issued by the Croatian National Tourist Board, was lower than in January and February of the previous years. But the number started rising in small steps until in April 2021, over the Easter holidays, more tourists came to Croatia than in the year before. Therefore, Brnjac’s statement that over Easter this year, there were fewer bookings than in previous years, is only partly true. “More is expected from the end of May and in June” The Minister’s claim that there is more interest by tourists for the end of May and June isn’t as easy to check as the first part of her statement – though it is possible to find some hints. The line chart shows that the number of tourist arrivals in 2020 started increasing in May, but to know for sure whether the same will be happening this year, hard data is needed. Numbers provided by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics show that in previous years tourists (apart from locals) mostly originated from Germany, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy and Austria (see bar chart). Therefore, our research concentrates on these countries.    We asked almost 30 companies and associations about bookings from Germans for the mentioned period, but travel agencies and airlines won’t disclose the data due to the competition on the market. While there are surveys about people’s opinion on travelling in the pandemic, there are none conducted on a European level and none focusing on travelling to Croatia. In order to gain at least some insight in people’s interests, we evaluated German surveys. Since those aren’t focused on holidays in Croatia, we can’t say for sure whether the results can be applied to our specific destination. But considering the current epidemiological situation and the measurements the country established through the “Safe Stay in Croatia” label, it is possible to make an assumption about the German’s interest in spending the holidays in Croatia. Reasons for travelling to Croatia According to data provided by the German search engine for holiday homes “Home To Go”, 6.2 % of all people using the engine searched for houses in Croatia for the period of Pentecost (May 22nd until June 5th), only topped by Italy (8.6%) and Germany itself (69.6%). A survey of the German consultancy “PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)” shows that most Germans prefer to stay in holiday homes (53%), even though 45% can also imagine staying in a hotel. Because there are about 90,000 private landlords offering holiday homes in Croatia, this preference could be an argument for spending the holidays there. In addition to that, the “PwC”-Survey states that the preferred method of transportation is the car (own or rental; 68%). The fact that even people from the most northern point of Germany can reach Zagreb within 15 hours by car (from the south it’s only 8 hours) also speaks for Croatia as a holiday destination. Furthermore, half of the participants were in favor of official certifications displaying the hygiene and health status of a destination and 43% set more value on health and hygiene than before the pandemic. Croatia’s “Safe stay” campaign meets these demands. Reasons against travelling to Croatia When it comes to the general interest in travelling this year, the participants of the “PwC”-Survey conducted in April 2021 are quite divided. While 42% had already booked a holiday or are planning to do so, 28% did not want to book something at all because of Covid-19. Not only do most of the Germans want to stay in Germany for their Pentecost holidays, according to “Home To Go” it’s almost twice as many as last year (2020: 38,1% → 2021: 69.6%). Although there is some interest in travelling for Pentecost, the majority (60%) wants to go on holidays in July or August. Furthermore, Lufthansa and Condor have announced flights from Germany to Croatia not before summer. Even though Eurowings will start flying to Croatia in May, announcements like the ones from Lufthansa and Condor are usually prompted by tourist demand, meaning that there probably isn’t as much interest in going to Croatia for Pentecost. Almost half of the “PwC” participants would cancel their trip if they had to put themselves under quarantine when coming back (47%) or if the destination was a high risk area (44%). Croatia is labelled as a high-risk country and therefore the Germans would have to go into quarantine after returning. Another reason for cancelling would be not being vaccinated (32%). But up until now only 11.2 percent of the German population have the necessary dose(s) of vaccine. When trying to use the German results as an example for tourists in general, the current travel measurements in the other top countries of origin should be considered. The regulations for Slovenia, Italy and Austria are almost the same as in Germany. Vacationers returning from Croatia have to be tested negatively with a PCR test and/or have to go into quarantine for five to ten days. Austria has announced new rules for May 19th. Tourists coming back from Croatia will have to be tested, vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 to enter the country, but do not have to go into quarantine anymore. In contrast, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not need a negative test nor a quarantine when returning. Conclusion Considering all this information, it is not possible to determine whether the statement is true or false. While we can make assumptions about the German’s interest in a holiday in Croatia, we can not confirm the Minister’s claim concerning all tourists. Additionally, we couldn’t find out on which source Brnjac based her prediction, which is why we have to classify the statement as uncheckable. At the end of her statement, Minister Nikolina Brnjac concludes: “…and that is why we should have the best epidemiological situation possible.” She also claims that Croatia is fully prepared to welcome tourists. What it means to be prepared and whether the country fulfils those requirements is part of another fact-check, done by our Croatian colleagues Kristina Kalea and Benjamin Mihoci.

42,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-croatia-is-fully-ready-to-start-tourist-movements/,“Croatia is fully ready to start tourist movements“,2021-05-20,eufactcheck,,"On March 31st, the Croatian Minister of Tourism and Sports, Nikolina Brnjac, declared that Croatia is fully prepared for the upcoming tourism season: “Croatia is fully ready to start tourist movements and that is the message we are sending to our emitting markets.” When looking at the preparations made by the Croatian Ministry of Tourism and Sports and the tourist industry itself, we find that the Minister’s statement turns out to be mostly true. According to the Croatian National Tourist Board, tourism contributes a large share of almost 20% to Croatian GDP which is one of the highest percentages in Europe. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that so much effort is invested in a successful tourist season as tourism is one of the most important branches of the Croatian economy. As a result of the global pandemic crisis, in the period from January to April 2021, Croatia recorded a decline in tourist traffic from most of the important emitting markets. On the bright side, in the first weekend of May there have already been more than 157.000 overnight stays registered in Croatia, of which 112.000 were booked by foreign tourists. Among the foreign tourists, the largest number of visitors come from Germany, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria and Italy. Therefore, the measures taken by Croatia for the purpose of a successful tourist season are “carefully monitored” in neighbouring and other countries. The Safe Stay in Croatia project In terms of Croatia being fully ready for tourists, the first key point of the country’s preparations for the 2021 tourist season is the “Safe Stay in Croatia” project. Through the project, business and customer treatment protocols have been designed in all tourism and tourism-related activities. The label “Safe Stay in Croatia” is awarded free of charge to participants from the Croatian tourism sector and to others who are part of the travel chain, such as carriers, airports, stations, nautical ports and marinas. To get the label, they need to log into the Government’s system and fill out an application form in which they guarantee compliance with and implementation of current health and safety recommendations of the Croatian Institute of Public Health. The project also introduces three levels of control for the facilities with a “Safe Stay in Croatia” label: the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the professional associations and the guests themselves who will be able to scan a QR code in order to get information about the facility where they are staying at (about the protocols and standards) and send comments via the Impressions section. The label of the program “Stay Safe in Croatia”. Vaccination of tourism sector workers Furthermore, as part of the tourist season preparations, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports has launched a Vaccination Program. The program prioritizes the vaccination of tourism sector workers. According to a study conducted by the Croatian Chamber of Commerce and the Croatian Tourism Association, two third of the tourist workers expressed a desire to be vaccinated. A vaccination program started in second half of April and is taking place throughout the country. The program started with vaccinating permanent and seasonal workers in the tourism sector and continues with the vaccination of 90,000 private accommodation providers. In addition, the authorities will establish additional locations for testing tourists, especially in tourist destinations. Islands as COVID free zones Moreover, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports has also launched the action “Croatian Islands – COVID free zones”. Even though most of Croatian islands have a low number of daily cases, in official statistics they were considered part of the mainland counties which had a higher number of daily cases. For this reason, the Government plans to present the epidemiological situation on islands as separate so tourists can better estimate the real risk of infection in these places.  German interest to travel (and visit Croatia) Despite the joint efforts for the preparation of the tourist season, it is still hard to predict its success. The tourist workers in Croatia follow what is going on in Germany, which is the largest emitting market in Europe and therefore very important for Croatian tourism. According to a study of trends and expectations of tourist demand in Germany in 2021 by the German FUR Institute, there is reason for optimism regarding tourism on the German market. Vacation trips are currently in second place in terms of consumption priorities. Almost half of the population certainly intends to travel in 2021 and they prefer destinations closer to the beach or mountains, which is positive news for Croatia, a preferred destination for Germans for years and the Mediterranean country closest to them.  In collaboration with the Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart, we researched how much interest tourists really have, especially from Germany, to visit Croatia. For more in-depth information about the interest by tourists to visit Croatia, we recommend checking out the following fact-check by our German colleagues Maren Krämer and Jule Müller. Conclusion In conclusion, we assess the Minister’s statement about Croatia being ready for tourist movements as mostly true. Some preparations are still ongoing and unfinished, such as the total vaccination of workers in the tourism industry, even though the vaccination has begun. The “Safe Stay in Croatia” project, which enables guests to easily identify destinations, accommodation providers, transport, tourist attractions, etc. that have adopted national and world standards of health and hygiene care is the key point of Croatia’s preparations for the upcoming tourist season. Even though the concept of “tourist movements“ could be considered a bit vague, our research shows that significant steps have been taken to ensure a safe stay for tourists who decide to come to Croatia. Therefore, this claim is considered as mostly true.

No sector was spared. Thus, the pandemic also had an impact on the field of sexual and reproductive Health and Rights. Julia Konowrocka addressed this issue in her article “Let’s talk about sexual and reproductive Health and Rights: Not fully implemented before Covid-19 & suspended during the pandemic”. We judge her claim that access to sexual and reproductive health and rights has become more complicated to be mostly true. The article, published on equineteurope.org on September 14, 2020, includes the claim: “During COVID-19, access to SRHR has become more complicated than before” and is about the current situation regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in the European Union during the Covid19 pandemic. The author, Julia Konowrocka, is Policy & Communication Assistant at Equinet, the European network of Equivalent Bodies. The article, published on equineteurope.org on September 14, 2020, includes the claim: “During COVID-19, access to SRHR has become more complicated than before“ To clarify what the following fact check is about, here is a brief explanation of what sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are and what they are for. SRHR is an umbrella term for various issues that affect men and women equally. They represent four separate areas: sexual health, sexual rights, reproductive health, and reproductive rights. SRHR thus encompass issues such as abortion, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, maternal health and rights, contraceptive access, gender-based violence, discrimination and stigma, and much more. Germany and the European Parliament on abortion and SRHR during the Corona pandemic On March 24, 2021 a press release published by Federal Office of Statistics shows that the number of abortions in 2020 in Germany compared to the year 2010 slightly decreased. Problem: the time window is 10 years. It would be more helpful if the figures referred to the previous year. Therefore, further research was carried out. The Federal Statistical Office in Germany also published a press release per quarter year, comparing it to the same quarter in the previous year. This shows that in the 1st quarter of 2020, abortions decreased by 2.0% compared to the previous year. In turn, there were 2.8% more abortions in the 2nd quarter of 2020 than in the 2nd quarter of 2019. But in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2020, abortion rates were again lower  than in the comparable quarters in 2019, but so insignificantly that it cannot be concluded that this can be attributed to Covid-19. Fact is that the European Parliament is well aware of the sometimes-inadequate consideration of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) during the pandemic. This clearly emerges from a plenary session on March 21, 2021, in which the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE), Dunja Mijatović, admits that SRHR is currently of great relevance despite the pandemic and cautions that it should not be relegated to the background because of Corona. Furthermore, the plenary session document on “The gender perspective in the COVID-19 crisis and post-crisis period” indicates that there were cancellations or postponements of “non-essential” health services in the wake of the pandemic. It also clarifies “that in this context, access to sexual and reproductive health care and services has been impeded with serious consequences, and legal attempts have been made in some Member States to restrict the right to safe and legal abortion, considering that women’s critical needs include access to maternity care and safe delivery, availability of contraceptives, safe abortions and in vitro fertilization services, and arrangements for clinical treatment in the event of rape.”  Other areas of SRHR during the pandemic In addition to abortion, issues such as surrogacy and access to period products are also part of SRHR. The Center for Reproductive Rights summarized the issues from individual EU countries. Particularly in the area of SRHR, it is evident, for example, in Ukraine that the transfer of babies created in surrogacy is more difficult during the Covid pandemic than it was before. Due to travel restrictions, the babies cannot be handed over to their new families, as the families mostly live abroad. Based on research insights in the wake of the Corona pandemic, there was the following political handling of the situation in 47 countries in Europe: Prohibition of abortions (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Poland)Suspension of abortions (Hungary)Restricted access to abortions (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Slovenia, England, Wales, and Scotland.). No pregnancy limits for abortions were extended here.Changes to reduce face-to-face consultations (Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland).Abortion via telemedicine (Denmark, Sweden, Wales, Scotland, France, and Ireland).Pharmacy access to prescribed mifepristone (Denmark, France). Measures such as telemedicine have reduced waiting times for women seeking abortions in countries such as Denmark, England, Ireland and France. In addition, these countries also show a decreased risk of infection for women and local hospital staff, explains Dr. Edward Morris (President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). Conclusion In summary, the claim: “During the COVID-19 pandemic and the lock down measures that followed, access to SRHR has become even more complicated than before” can be classified as mostly true. This is mainly due to the fact that several documents prove the impact of the Corona pandemic on the access to SRHR. However, it is difficult to determine how to evaluate the term “complicated” in the claim and whether the difficult access to SRHR has resulted in more health problems. This makes it difficult to classify the claim as “true”. Our conclusion: This claim is currently mostly true.

Several European news media reported on this. According to the study data, this claim is mostly true. However, Finnish experts say that to analyze the claim more closely more information would be needed than Pfizer-Biontech provides in the press release. Pfizer-Biontech is a combination of two companies that have developed the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. Pfizer is in charge of the research, while Biontech is in charge of manufacturing the vaccine. The study on adolescents has not yet been published or peer reviewed. Since the press release, Pfizer has received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the vaccine.   A screenshot of Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reporting on the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine study on 12–15-year-olds. What does the 100 % efficacy rate mean?  The Pfizer-Biontech vaccine has been approved in the USA and in the EU for people aged 16 and over. The companies did not take on developing a new vaccination but agreed to test their adult-approved vaccine on children. In the study the vaccine was given to 1131 people without prior evidence of covid infection. None of the participants caught the Covid-19 virus. A placebo drug was given to a control group of 1129 people. Of the control group, 18 people got infected with Covid-19.  According to the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare’s chief physician Dr. Hanna Nohynek, 100 % efficacy rate could mean several things: complete protection against either a) catching the virus, b) an illness that might lead to hospitalization or c) death. Therefore, it is important to specify what endpoints were used in measuring the efficacy – that is to say, what the goal of the study was. Dr. Nohynek also pointed out that it is difficult to compare the outcomes of vaccine studies without sufficient data on the premises, population studied and epidemiological situations where the studies were carried out, as the study set ups vary. Furthermore, Dr. Ilkka Seppä, physician coordinator of Tampere University’s Vaccine Research Center noted that fully developed vaccines rarely have an efficacy rate of 100 %. On the media responsibility It seems that the press release is aimed at investors and should be viewed from this particular perspective. The press release refers to Nasdaq information on the companies’ stock value and lists contact information of the companies’ investor relations staff, rather than their vaccine experts. The press release was quoted in news around Europe immediately after its release. Noticeable was that many news medias did not provide a background on the topic.   Conclusion It is true that the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine offers a protection against Covid-19 for 12–15-year-olds in this stage of development, but the claim of 100 % effectiveness is relative. According to the chief physician of the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, Dr. Hanna Nohynek, we need specific information on the goals of each study to be able to evaluate the study results.

The claim turns out to be true.  The coronavirus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, spread rapidly across Europe in early 2020, forcing different governments to adopt severe measures such as lockdowns that affected around 250 million people. Italy became the first country in the European Union to suffer the ravages of the pandemic and quickly began to register high rates of infections and mortality that soon spread to other European countries. In a similar vein to other European countries, the coronavirus pandemic began to hit Spain in March 2020. As a result, the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of alarm throughout the Spanish territory on 14 March, thus limiting mobility and establishing other restrictions to control the spread of the virus. In October, the government granted some freedom to the different regional governments of the country to implement their own measures, which generated discrepancies at the political level between the different parties and regions of the country. On 10 March 2021, the president of the Community of Madrid and member of the conservative Popular Party (PP), Isabel Díaz Ayuso, called snap elections for the capital’s regional government on 4 May. The contest led Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos, a far-left party, to resign as vice minister of Spain to run for election as a candidate himself. The electoral campaign began on April 18. The campaign has mainly focused on the way in which Díaz Ayuso has handled the coronavirus pandemic in Madrid, the region of Spain that has imposed the fewest restrictions despite having high rates of infections and mortality among its population. The first electoral debate between the candidates to preside over the Madrid government was held on 21 April. It was produced by Madrid’s public television Telemadrid and broadcast also by Spanish public television (TVE) and the private channel La Sexta. During the debate, the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, referred to the deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic in Madrid and claimed that “Madrid is among the European cities with the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants, 2207, more than London, Paris, Rome or Berlin”.   Screenshot of Pablo Iglesias during the electoral debate Is Madrid at the same level of mortality as other European capitals? On 10 April, journalist Pepo Jiménez, based on data from Statista, compared the number of deaths per million inhabitants of Madrid with other European capitals such as London, Paris / Ile de France, Rome / Lazio and Berlin. Data provided by Jiménez in Twitter revealed that Madrid presented 2,207 deaths per million inhabitants.   Screenshot of Pepo Jiménez tweet To provide an updated account of Iglesias’ statement, the most recent data provided by Statista on April 22 was also reviewed. According to data, in Madrid, as of April, 14,889 people have died from complications derived from the COVID-19 disease, thus positioning Madrid as the Spanish community with the highest number of deaths. Considering that the population of the Community of Madrid is 6,642,000 people, then the mortality rate per million inhabitants is 2,241. To obtain this figure, the number of deaths has been divided by the population and multiplied by one thousand.   Screenshot of Statista showing number of deaths related to COVID-19 in Spain as of April 20, 2021, by autonomous community. Continuing with the rest of the European capitals that Iglesias mentioned in his statement and applying the same mathematical formula, it was found that in London the number of deaths per million inhabitants is 1,780; in the Rome / Lazio region it is 1,277; in Paris / Ile de France it is 1,485; and finally, in Berlin it is 875. A comparison between the number of deaths per million inhabitants in those European capitals is presented in this graphic.      Former official of the World Health Organization, Daniel López-Acuña has been contacted to explain why in Madrid the number of deaths is greater than in other European capitals. According to López-Acuña, “the penetration of the virus in Madrid has been greater than in other European cities and in other Spanish regions largely due to the lack of sufficiently thorough restrictions to mobility and social interaction”. As noted by the interviewee, a study conducted by the Institute Carlos III in conjunction with the different regional governments has determined that when compared to the rest of the Spanish regions, the mortality of Madrid “ranks among the highest, and is close to 8 times higher than the one observed in Canary Islands for example”. Another factor contributing to the higher mortality rates in Madrid “could be the very high rate of deaths occurring among the population resident in nursing homes”. As stressed by López-Acuña, “older people had greater severity and mortality than other groups of the population, were not adequately and timely refer to hospitals for appropriate care and unfortunately experienced very high lethality”. Considering these factors, “Madrid has contributed not only with the largest absolute number of deaths to the total of people who passed away because of COVID-19 in Spain but, once measured by population size and expressed in mortality rates, it shows one of the highest mortality rates in the country and among European capitals”. As noted by López-Acuña, in Madrid “mortality is scandalously high, current incidence rates are among the highest in Spain and the current saturation of Intensive Care Units is also tremendously high”. Conclusion As the interviewed expert Daniel López-Acuña mentioned, it is always better to do a deep analysis by standardizing the age groups when trying to compare between different cities or countries. That being said, statistical data observed in this fact check and the expert’s vision conclude that the data in Madrid are tremendously negative and therefore it can be said that Madrid is one of the European capitals with the worst mortality rates. Thus, we conclude that the statement made by Pablo Iglesias during the electoral debate is true.    RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Pilar Suárez López, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ES Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

46,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-catholic-church-loses-members-europe-wide/,“Catholic Church loses members – Europe-wide”,2021-05-05,eufactcheck,,"Meanwhile, the Catholic Church is struggling not only with scandals involving its own personnel. According to Friedel Taube, a journalist at Deutsche Welle, it is also facing a Europe-wide loss of members – especially in the Catholic strongholds. By researching hard and soft factors, this claim can be evaluated as “mostly true”. A Christian baptism cannot be annulled. A ruling by the VGH in Munich justifies this with the fact that the bond thus established between the baptized person and God is inseparable. But what happens if one no longer feels that one belongs to one’s own church? In an article published on 22.02.2021, Friedel Taube examined the decline in membership of the Catholic Church. The article suggests that, according to Taube, a wave of church departures is taking place “[…]and this throughout Europe, especially in Catholic strongholds.” Screenshot of the headline of the investigated article: Catholic Church loses members – Europe-wide. Appeared on the website of Deutsche Welle on 22.02.2021 Germany and the trend toward atheism In Germany, baptized but non-believing Christians have the chance to officially leave the church. On the basis of the church tax levied, it is thus possible to record exact numbers of people leaving the Catholic and Protestant churches. According to the statements of both church federations, a clear trend of leaving the church is emerging in Germany. Thus, more than a quarter of a million Christians of both denominations left the church in 2019. On the Catholic side, 272,771 members declared their resignation, according to a report by the German Bishops’ Conference (DBK). On the Protestant side, around 270,000 resignations are assumed. This was confirmed by Annika Lukas from the press office of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD). The region around Cologne stood out as particularly willing to leave in 2021. Here the trend reached such a height that the district court increased the dates starting from March by further 500 dates. Taube’s statements can thus be confirmed with regard to Germany. The cradle of Catholicism becomes atheistic Likewise, according to the article, Catholicism is also on the decline in Italy. This statement is based on the so-called mandate tax. As part of the income tax, this makes it possible to choose whether the personal share is paid out to the church or to publicly visible cultural projects. The article claims that the percentage of taxpayers benefiting the Catholic Church is declining at 30%. This publication is regular, with a four-year delay. In comparison with previous publications, a declining trend can be observed. Current figures show that only 33% of taxpayers favor the Catholic Church. With regard to Taube’s reference to the Italian sociologist of religion Franco Garelli, the statement can also be confirmed. Thus, only one fifth of Italians regularly attend Catholic masses. This could not only be explained by the investigation of the mentioned Turin religion sociologist as applicable. In addition, the religion sociologist Detlef Pollack, confirmed such a downward trend: “Catholicism in Italy today is so fragmented that it can exert relatively little influence on the public.” Whether a third of Italians today really profess atheism is questionable. Nevertheless, a study by the Pew Research Center shows that the trend toward atheism is also increasing in Italy. Thus, Taube’s statements can be assessed as “mostly true” in the case of Italy. Estimated trends in the distribution of faiths in Italy according to a study by the Pew Research Center. Created with Datawrapper. Catholic Spain – Leaving excluded Furthermore, the article under review states that it is not possible to leave the church in Catholic Spain. It refers that leaving the Catholic Church, as is at least theoretically possible in Germany, is impossible in Spain. By research no facts can be found from official sides. Also the press office of the Catholic church did not comment on it. Only the Spanish correspondent of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Javier Cáceres, confirmed by asking that Friedel’s statement is true. An official resignation from the church is factually not possible. However, there are various loopholes. For example, the official church affiliation can be deleted from the church’s data. Instructions for this unofficial exit from the church can be found in the online newspaper “El Espanol“. Thus, it can be stated that there are inofficial ways for Spaniards to leave the church. Generation break in poland According to Taube, Catholic Poland is also suffering from the decline in the number of believers. For this, he refers to a study by the Warsaw-based opinion institute CBOS. The study from the summer of 2019 shows that within 25 years, the percentage of Christian teenagers decreased by 20%. To confirm these statements, however, the study lacks insight. No such publicly available study is available in the CBOS databases. Thus, it is difficult to understand how the population percentage of students has a major impact on the general turning away from the church. The study “Situation of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland“, published in the summer of 2019, contains concrete figures. The survey assessed the situation of the Church in Poland between 2014 and 2019. Here it could be determined that the number of people in Poland who evaluate the situation of the Church as “very bad” doubled from 2014 to 2019. The number of citizens who rate the situation as “very good” halved. St. Patrick and his lost sheep In 2016, the Irish Censorship report confirmed that many residents of strictly Catholic communities no longer feel a sense of belonging in the Church. These figures are corroborated by a 2012 global survey conducted by the WIN-Gallup International Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. This survey randomly sampled 1,001 Irish citizens. The results revealed that 47% of Irish respondents considered themselves religious. 44 percent said they were not religious, while ten percent even admitted to being atheists. In a global comparison, Ireland is one of the more atheistic countries. Also within 30 years, the percentage of Irish Catholics declined by 13 percent. The Irish census proves this. While 91.6 percent professed Catholicism in 1991, only 78.3 percent did so in 2016. But who is responsible? For one thing, the rapid downward trend of Catholicism in Ireland is attributed to the Murphy Report of 2009. It remains to be seen what the 2021 census will reveal. But due to canon law, citizens of Ireland are currently legally prohibited from officially leaving the church. However, the website of notme.ie offers interested parties the opportunity to symbolically leave the church.  Conclusion Taubes’ statement “Catholic Church loses members – Europe-wide” can be partially agreed with. On the one hand, an actual downturn in membership in the Catholic Church can be observed. Even in strictly Catholic countries such as Ireland or Poland, surveys show that the number of believers is falling. Clear figures issued by the state are available only in Germany and Italy. The factual situation proves the complete correctness of the article on these points. On the other hand, it should be noted that in strictly Catholic countries such as Poland, Ireland and Spain, only soft factors such as surveys serve as a factual basis. One reason for this is that members in these countries are not allowed to officially leave the denomination. Due to this circumstance, the accuracy of Taubes’ statement cannot be clearly determined. Official figures do not exist. Taubes’ statement “[…] especially in Catholic strongholds” is therefore to be viewed critically. In summary, the statement can therefore only be classified as “mostly true.” This rating is based on the fact that, according to Taube’s statement, Catholic strongholds in particular are strongly affected by the loss of members. This is confirmed in surveys. However, no clear figures are available. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

47,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-more-than-98-of-people-infected-with-the-coronavirus-barely-experience-any-symptoms/,“More than 98% of people infected with the coronavirus barely experience any symptoms”,2021-05-04,eufactcheck,,"Thierry Baudet, a Dutch politician, claims that less than 2% of the people infected with the coronavirus experience symptoms. He made his claim on the 10th of January 2021 in the late-night TV show Op1. We rate the claim as false. Thierry Baudet is the front man of the political party Forum voor Democratie (Forum for Democracy, FVD). The party can be identified as a nationalist-populist party and Baudet is known for his controversial statements. Journalists often perform fact checks on claims he makes. The Dutch TV program EenVandaag checked the above claim as well and labelled it as false. However, we think their fact check is not detailed enough. For that reason, we decided to check Baudets claim that “more than 98 percent of people infected with corona, barely experience any symptoms”. Thierry Baudet in the Op1 show where he made the claim.  Infection radar The Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) is a Dutch state institution that specializes in virus control and national prevention programs. For them, the main goal is tracking and fighting the coronavirus. They monitor the number of people infected with the coronavirus and  the percentage of people with corona-like symptoms. They advise the Dutch government on how to fight the coronavirus. They launched an infection radar. This monitors the percentage of people who experience corona-like symptoms. This percentage is not the same as the percentage of infected people. On the 10th of January 2021 the percentage of people who experience corona-like symptoms is 1.7%. This percentage is comparable to the claim. Thierry Baudet claims more than 98% of the people hardly experience symptoms, which means less than 2% of the people do experience the symptoms. However, the infection radar is monitoring the percentage of people with corona-like symptoms and not the percentage of people who are actually infected with the virus. Therefore, we can conclude the following: Thierry Baudet obtained his information from the right source but from the wrong investigation. Baudet is not willing to react on this.  Experts Frits Rosendaal, professor of clinical epidemiology at Leiden University medical Center, did a regional analysis on the percentage of people admitted to a hospital due to their coronavirus infection. The result: 1.000 people of the 17.000 infected are admitted to a hospital. This is approximately 6%, and this is just the number of people admitted to a hospital. According to the RIVM the total number of people infected with the coronavirus in The Netherlands was on the 6th of February 2021, 1.001.894. On the 2nd of February 2021, the Nationale Intensive Care Evaluatie (NICE) carried out a report with recent corona statistics. In this report: 38.902 of the people infected with the coronavirus were admitted to a hospital. This number includes ICU admissions. (38.902/1.001.894) x100% = 3.8828…%. This means that at least 3.8% of the people infected with the coronavirus were admitted to a hospital. This percentage conflicts with the claim of Thierry Baudet in which he claims that less than 2% experience symptoms. Conclusion In short, Thierry Baudet claims that more than 98% of the people infected with the coronavirus barely experience symptoms. However, the Nationale Intensive Care Evaluatie (NICE) reported in February 2021 that at least 3.8% of the infected people were admitted to a hospital. This number does not even include the percentage of people who got very ill without being admitted to a hospital. Therefore, we conclude that the claim is false.

It would be 13,000,000 euros, a transfer described as “humanitarian aid”. The claim turns out to be uncheckable. Joachim Kuhs is a German Member of European Parliament and member of AfD since 2019. He also published a book on the AfD. On 15 December 2020,  Kuhs posted an article on his website in which he cites various topics. According to him the original values of the EU are not always visible. He also cites that it is time for the Christian Democrats to adopt a more rational policy. “Especially in times of many Islamic attacks”, Kuhs continues. Uncheckable: “EU finances persecutors of Christians and enemies of Jews” Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Taliban Kuhs writes: “Instead, the EU finances the persecution of Christians and hostility to Jews. Over the years, the EU has provided many tens of millions of euros to the Iranian mullah regime. Recently, a transfer of 13 million euro was ordered – despite increasing budget deficits, over-indebtedness and an even heavier tax and social security burden on the population within the EU”.  Whether Kuhs’ claim is true, we cannot say for sure. That 13,000,000 euros have gone from the EU to Iran is true. But what Iran exactly does with the money is not known. According to Kuhs, this money is passed on to terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban, … Diplomats and deal According to Tom Sauer, professor of Political Sciences at the University of Antwerp, it is humanitarian aid, which is followed up in Iran by European diplomats. “There is some sort of control on where the money goes. There are Belgian diplomats, and every EU country has an embassy in Iran”, Sauer says. “The money that has been transferred is described as ‘humanitarian aid’ on the transaction, but what exactly happens to that money is never certain.” Sauer mentions another reason why Iran will probably not misuse the money: “This transfer of 13,000,000 euros is peanuts, compared to the new billion-dollar deal with the US that is planned. So, it is in the interest of Iran to spend the money correctly because it might not get more money in the future anymore”, Sauer says. Conclusion It is clear, the transfer was made with certainty. Where the money went afterwards, remains uncertain. “Apart from those involved, I think hardly anyone can say with certainty where the money went”, concludes Sauer. The claim of German MEP Joachim Kuhs is thus uncheckable. RESEARCH | ARTICLE © AP University College Antwerp, Belgium Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

49,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-bulgaria-has-stopped-using-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/,Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,2021-04-27,eufactcheck,,"This factcheck examines the origin and authenticity of the statement “Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine”, made in an AlJazeera article. It turns out that the claim is TRUE.This topic is of extremely high importance for the health situation in Europe but more so for Bulgaria – the reactions towards the introduction of vaccines in Bulgaria were polarized and the society reacted strongly both for and against. That is why it is important to check this decision made by the government which impacts the health of the whole community. The validation of this information was necessary because contradictory messages appeared in the media space here. Facts first! Bulgaria is among the countries in the European Union, received a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine, which has undergone additional checks. Bulgaria has stopped using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, joining a small number of European countries that have halted its use after reports that some recipients developed serious blood clots. There were reports of roughly 37 cases of blood clots occurring after vaccination in many European countries and a few of them are fatal. On the 12th of March Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Boyko Borisov stated that the use of the vaccine in Bulgaria would also be paused “until all doubts are dispelled and as long as the experts do not give guarantees that it does not pose a risk to the people, and while in a written opinion the European Medicine Agency (EMA) dismissed any doubts and to its safety. “ In this article from the 12th of March 2021 it is stated “Bulgaria latest to halt AstraZeneca vaccine”. The claim is factual, based on official information and its subject is clearly defined as the temporary halt of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Bulgaria. The author of the claim is the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borissov and his claim was based on a primairy source, refered to in the article.  A second expert, the Minister of Health Kostadin Angelov confirms the claim. “ In Bulgaria we also have a fatal outcome, but we have no proof that is due to it.”, said the Minister of Health Kostadin Angelov. Moreover, according to the Brussels Times, the European Medicines Agency EMA is still investigating second side effect of AstraZeneca vaccine. What happens in the field? But what is the story behind the official information and what happens in the hospitals? According to a phone interview with Maria Spasova  – a PR of Maichin Dom (Mothers’ home)–  they stopped using AstraZeneca as soon as a RZI  (Regional Health Inspectorate) official rule was handed to all hospitals in Bulgaria and a regulation was issued by the Ministry of Health. This was on the same day as the statement was made.  The patients who had their first dose of AstraZeneca given already were instructed to wait until the vaccine is put in use again. Mothers’ home restarted the vaccine usage after the second statement by Ministry of Health on March 18, which stated that the vaccination with AstraZeneca should be resumed the next day. The Military Academy accepted people for second dosage even after the first official announcement, according to their Facebook post on March 12.  On March 19 their Facebook page confirms the official statement by the government to resume all vaccination with AstraZeneca.  University Multi-profile Hospital for Active Treatment and Emergency Medicine Pirogov  has the same policy as Maichin Dom and resumed vaccination after the second government statement, according to their Facebook page.  Military Medical Academy, photo by Viktoria Kostova Alexandrovska University Hospital reacts the same way and even shares two interviews on the topic of resuming the vaccination on March 19. Conclusion Bulgaria was one of the first countries to halt the usage of AstraZeneca. Bulgarian citizens however weren’t sure whether this statement of the government was true or some immature decision due to insufficient arguments. Factchecking showed that the hospitals were instructed to stop vaccination on 12 March until vaccine was put back into use on 19 March 2021. Three of leading and biggest hospitals in Bulgaria – Pirogov, Alexandrovska and Military Medical Academy, where patients seek information’s updates every day, confirmed this policy.  The usage of AstraZeneca has been restarted by the order of Ministry of Health , but the reasons are not entirely clear, as an interview with  Maichin Dome proved.  The effect of the confusion was that Bulgarians now prefer to be vaccinated by Moderna and Pfizer- BioNTech. The scientific research about the potential helath risk of the AstraZeneca vaccin is ongoing and to early to be factchecked. We found the statement made in the media to be true.

The progressive parties voted agents the statement. When asked to explain their view GroenLinks (green party) leader Jesse Klaver claimed that nuclear energy, as a solution for fossil energy, is the biggest lie in this election. He also claimed that nuclear energy will not help achieve the climate goals from the Paris treaty.   The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty against climate change. The accord was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21, on 12 December 2015 and put into action on 4 November 2016 (United Nations). One of the goals in the accord is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century (United Nations).  “The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt its effects.” (United Nations) Nuclear power plants across the globe Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation. During its life cycle a nuclear power plant produces about the same amount of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per unit of electricity as wind, and one-third of the emissions per unit of electricity when compared with solar (World Nuclear Association). Average life-cycle carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions for different electricity generators (Source: IPCC)  Since April 2020, there are 440 operable power reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 390 GW. Additionally, there are 55 reactors under construction and 109 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 63 GW and 118 GW. Respectively there are 329 more reactors proposed (World Nuclear Association). Across the European Union are 106 nuclear power reactors (104 GWe) operating in 13 of the 27 EU member states that account for over one-quarter of the electricity generated in the whole of the EU. Over half of the EU’s nuclear electricity is produced in only one country – France. The 57 units operating in three non-EU countries (Russia, Ukraine and Switzerland) account for about 15-20% of the electricity in the rest of Europe. Norway and Switzerland are effectively part of the EU synchronous grid (World Nuclear Association). Source: World Nuclear Association The role of a nuclear power plant in fighting climate change Nuclear power, which currently means energy derived from fission (splitting the uranium atom), has a minima carbon footprint of around the 15-50g CO2/KWh.  In comparison the average footprint of gas as energy source, is around 450g CO2/KWh. According to these numbers, using nuclear power can be a good way to reduce the carbon footprint and achieve the climate goals. Also, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nuclear energy currently contributes to the prevention of CO2 emission of about 1.3 to 2.6 gigatons each year, assuming it replaces either gas-or coal-fired generation (World Nuclear Association). Besides that, one kilogram of uranium (U235) generates almost 23 million kWh of electricity: enough to provide nearly seven thousand households with electricity for a year. About 30 percent of the energy contained in uranium is converted into electricity (efficiency). According to GroenLinks (green party) this is no reason to invest in nuclear power plants. In an email, the party explained their position as follows: “Uranium, which is used for nuclear power generation, will run out over time. Whereas, we can always count on wind and solar energy”. Another argument for nuclear energy, which is used quite often, is that nuclear energy provides investment opportunities and jobs and the basis for economic security in communities that host nuclear plants. Nuclear power plants as an alternative source of energy The political parties that are against nuclear power and believe that it’s not contributing to the CO2 emissions, are also wondering if nuclear power plants are a feasible option to reduce fossil fuel and help to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.  Their most used argument is that building a nuclear power plant takes a long time and will cost billions of euros. Besides that, the construction costs of nuclear power plants depend on many different determinants such as: design revisions during construction, large plant size and complex large-scale technology, lack of standardization, serialization and modularization, plant safety and environmental concerns, prevention of accidents and risks. These possible cost determinants (see table 1) can influence the construction time of Power Plants (PWRs) and are classified in three general groups: technical, regulatory, and institutional (Construction time of Power Plants PWRs). Figure 2: Construction time of PWRs          During 1980 and 2000 the time for building a nuclear power plant was 92 months or 7.7 years with a maximum of 10 years. Nowadays building a nuclear power plant will take 41 months, still almost 4 years, due to innovation. Lots of goals are aimed at 2050 (mid-century), that is only 30 years from now. We will have 25 years from the moment the nuclear plant is operational, is that enough? According to the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD, yes. Modern nuclear power plants can very well do the absorb variations in the supply of sustainable sources. Nuclear power plants adjust between 50 and 100% power at a rate of 5% per minute. For example, nuclear energy in France has been providing for forty years adjustable CO2-neutral electricity, 24 hours per day, seven days a week (Nuclear energy is needed to achieve the climate goals). It will take renewed attention and a sense of urgency across the world to stimulate a new wave of nuclear investments. The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation is a political minefield at every level. Beyond technological problems, it is politics that is the biggest obstacle to the more widespread adoption of nuclear energy (Clingendael Spector). Advantages and disadvantages of a nuclear power plant Another argument against nuclear power is radioactive waste. Opponents of nuclear energy consider this as one of the most important arguments. There is not yet a good way to store or process it. For example, in the Netherlands nuclear power has been stored in the southern province Zeeland. The low to medium radioactive waste is stored in a bunker. Poured into concrete, in order to limit the radiation as much as possible. The highly radioactive waste is stored in another bunker, also poured into concrete and stored in iron tubes. Because radioactive waste does not decay and remains on earth for thousands of years, storage is no long-term solution. Figure 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear power Conclusion With the statement “Nuclear energy is the biggest lie in this election”, Klaver expresses his opinion that nuclear energy is not the answer to a zero-emissions future “we do not have time, it is not sustainable, and we can better spend the money on more future-proof solutions, which will also benefit the coming generations,” he argued. However, nuclear energy as a solution to reduce CO2-emissions is not inherently a “lie”, as Klaver states. Supporters of nuclear energy rightfully point at the low CO2-emissions. But if it will prove to be a solution for meeting the climate goals in the Paris agreement is a very complicated issue. Klavers’ statement is as much a prediction as the position of the supporters of nuclear power. And therefore uncheckable.

Screenshot of FPÖ-press-release on February 24th, 2021 The FPÖ-statement refers to unnamed police sources and gives the impression that it originated from the article in the Austrian tabloid „Kronen Zeitung”, which had been written by journalists Karl Grammer and Christian Schulter. Yet, in the article itself, no information, including the statement in question, can be found. After contacting journalist Karl Grammer, he explained: “The article indeed refers to migrants currently finding their way into the Schengen Area, mainly via cargo trains and trucks. But the statement that about 20 percent directly take corona along with them, does neither come from us nor from the local officials who gave us a insight into the current situation.” Hence, we ruled out that the statement came from the “Kronen Zeitung”. The next step was to get more information on COVID-19-tests on illegal migrants from the Austrian Ministry of the Interior. According to the Ministry’s spokesperson Harald Sörös “the responsible authorities of the national police department offer voluntary tests on COVID-19 to persons who are unlawfully staying on federal territory.”  Furthermore, Sörös noted that there is no legal basis for a compulsory COVID-19-test for illegal migrants. Also, no statistics about positive tests within this group are being conducted. This information leads to the conclusion that the statement in the press release of the FPÖ-parliamentary group is at least partly false.  Since it can’t be guaranteed that all illegal migrants are being tested on COVID-19 on arrival, it is not possible to make an exact statement about the percentage of positive tests. Moreover, no official statistics exist that could prove a proportion of 20 percent. Still pending is a statement of the FPÖ-parliamentary group concerning this issue, in which the percentage or the source of this statement is named. Conclusion In short, the claim that “around 20 percent of illegal migrants are bringing the coronavirus to Austria“ is mostly false.

52,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-who-does-not-recommend-antigen-testing-in-schools/,“WHO does not recommend antigen testing in schools”,2021-03-30,eufactcheck,,"On February the 24th the Irish minister of Education Norma Foley of the party Fianna Fáil made a statement about antigen testing at schools. “The World Health Organization does not recommend antigen testing in schools.” Her claim is mostly false. The Education minister stated in a radio interview with RTÉ radio 1 that the WHO does not recommend antigen testing at schools. Although she didn’t refer to a direct source in the interview, her statement can be based on a report from the World Health Organization about rapid antigen testing.    First of all, to check this statement we tried to find the original quote from the World Health Organization. In our search we found the original report from the World Health Organization: “SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests, an implementation guide making multiple statements about Antigen Testing.”  This is the only recent report from the WHO about the use of antigen tests at schools and in general. In the report the World Health Organization makes multiple statements about the situations when to use antigen tests.  Performance criteria Rapid antigen tests that meet the recommended performance criteria should be considered for use only in areas where NAAT tests (PCR tests) are unavailable or where the health system may be overburdened. This means that the WHO only makes a suggestion about Antigen Testing. There is nothing said about no recommendation or prohibition such as claimed by Norma Foley. Support Rapid antigen testing should be used to support outbreak investigations in semi-closed groups like schools, care homes, workplaces or where COVID-19 outbreaks have been confirmed. Rapid tests could be used to screen at-risk individuals and rapidly isolate positive cases. The WHO refers explicitly to the use of antigen tests at schools. The organization describes that the use of antigen testing in school is indeed a possible option and not an ‘out of the question’ statement.  Widespread community transmission  Antigen tests may be used for early detection and isolation of positive cases in health facilities, Covid-19 testing centers/sites, care homes, prisons, schools, front-line and health care workers. The indicated statement here is that antigen tests can be used for widespread community transmission in school. This means that antigen testing could be used to detect the virus in places, like schools where there are signs of an outbreak. This shows just like the previous statements that WHO doesn’t ‘not recommend’ the use of Antigen Testing in school. They simply make a recommendation of situations in which to use the rapid antigen tests.  European Commission criteria  The European Commission published on October the 28th 2020 a report with recommendations for testing strategies, including the use of rapid antigen tests. According to the report from the European Commission the antigen tests can be used in certain settings or scenarios.  The European Commission gathered information from the World Health Organization. According to the WHO, while the antigen tests offer helpful solutions for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in certain settings, their performance is not flawless. More European countries want to use rapid tests like the antigen test in medical settings and explore their wider use. WHO recommends rapid antigen tests that have performance requirements of > 80% sensitivity and > 97% specificity. These tests should be used when the availability of RT-PCR tests is temporarily limited. Rapid antigen tests should also be used by trained operators, similarly with the manufacturer’s instructions and within the first 5-7 days following symptoms. Agreement  In a recent report from the European Commission, named “A common list of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, including those of which their test results are mutually recognized, and a common standardized set of data to be included in COVID-19 test result certificates” are final statements about the use of rapid antigen tests. This report was published seven days prior to the radio interview with Norma Foley. EU member states agreed on the criteria to be used for the selection of rapid antigen tests. In particular on the clinical performance and on the scenarios and settings which these tests would be appropriate to use. The fact that there is an agreement made with all the member states of the European Union, says something about the statement. The member states (including Ireland) made an agreement about use of the antigen tests when acknowledged. Norma Foley was not in the position to make this claim, because there is an European Union agreement.  Conclusion In short, Education minister Norma Foley states that antigen testing in schools is not recommended. But the reports from the World Health Organization and European Commission say otherwise. The WHO recommends antigen testing in schools but only in certain situations such as widespread community transmission and outbreak investigations. Therefore, the statement made by Norma Foley is incomplete. A second component that weighs into this claim is the report from the European Commission. Agreements have been made with member states about the collective use of antigen tests and countries cooperate in researching rapid antigen tests. According to this report it can be used in situations where it is recognized. Foley did not take this agreement into consideration while making this statement on the radio. Therefore, the claim ‘‘The WHO does not recommend antigen testing at schools’’ made by Irish minister of Education Norma Foley is incomplete. We conclude that her claim is mostly false.

53,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-average-monthly-retirement-pension-in-latvia-is-77-thousand-rubles/,“The average monthly retirement pension in Latvia is 77 thousand rubles”,2021-03-29,eufactcheck,,"On July 3rd, 2020, the Moscow City Duma held a meeting during which Deputy Yevgeny Stupin presented a draft of federal law on the abolition of pension reform. A video of his speech (in Russian) was posted on the YouTube channel “Совесть Некрасовки” (Сonscience of Nerkasovka). In his report, Mr. Stupin proposed to increase pension payments. He claimed that an average pension size in Russia is 19 thousand RUB (about 250 EUR)*, while in neighboring Latvia it is 77 thousand RUB (about 1000 EUR). Our research showed that this statement is false.   Mr. Stupin referred to the data provided by the website of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but the information on Latvian pensions is not publicly available on the mentioned website. However, according to the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, the average size of old-age pensions paid during the 2nd quarter of 2020 was 363 EUR. In terms of rubles, it was around 28 314 RUB. Figure 1: “The average size of the monthly old-age pension”, the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia The research presented in November 2020 by “Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze”, one of the most influential newspapers in Latvia, shows that, according to the State Social Insurance Agency of the Republic of Latvia, almost 55% of Latvian pensioners are paid 300-500 EUR per month. The same statistics claim that 19% of the pensioners get 200-300 EUR, 15,9% – more than 500 EUR, and 10,5% – less than 200 EUR. Figure 2: “Number of pensioners by pension size”, Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze/ the State Social Insurance Agency of the Republic of Latvia In recent years, the problem of low pensions is exacerbating due to the fact that Latvia takes second place among all EU countries where pensioners aged over 65 are at risk of poverty, according to the Eurostat research conducted in 2020. In 2019, the percentage of Latvian pensioners, who were at risk of poverty, has reached 54%. One of the sources of the problem is a lack of benefits for senior citizens. Starting 2021, the amount of pension exceeding 330 EUR is subject to income tax, which ranges from 20% to 31% depending on the annual income; for most pensioners it is 20% as their annual income is less than 20, 004 EUR. So, we are speaking about high taxes and one of the smallest old-age pensions in Europe. Figure 3: “At-risk-of-poverty rate for pensioners”, Eurostat Conclusion Since Mr. Stupin did not respond to our letter, we were unable to find out where the figures from his report were actually taken from. However, the statistics provided by the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, the State Social Insurance Agency of the Republic of Latvia, and Eurostat do not match the text of the speech. So we conclude this statement as false and claim that the actual average size of pensions in Latvia is more than two times lower than presented in Mr. Stupin’s report. * Hereinafter we used the exchange rate presented as of June 2020 – 78 rubles per euro RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Julia Bakaeva, Ksenia Golovina, Sofya Lischinska, Lobachevsky University, RU Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

In television programme Studio City he said that generally speaking Slovenia has had one of the longest “lockdowns” in Europe. He also stated Slovenia had a thorough system that, in his opinion, did not work. This statement is mostly true. Zdravko Počivalšek is Slovenian Minister of Economic Development and Technology. He became the minister in 2018. He is also the president of political party Stranka modernega centra – SMC. During the coronavirus pandemic, Počivalšek was criticized for the large government purchase of protective masks, which were not suitable for use by health professionals. Although many called for his resignation, the minister did not do so. On 7 December 2020, he was a guest on a television programme Studio City broadcasted by RTV Slovenija, where they discussed coronavirus measures, lockdowns and current political situation in the country. During the show, Počivalšek made the statement, that Slovenia had “one of the longest” lockdowns in Europe. He continued that the system of a lockdown is a “thorough” one but in his opinion it has not been working. In the weeks prior to his appearance on the show, the Slovenian public could see a battle going on between Zdravko Počivalšek and then Minister of Health Tomaž Gantar.  Počivalšek was explaining that the country has to reopen some economics sectors otherwise the Slovenian economy will collapse. And at the same time Gantar was trying to implement an even stricter lockdown and saying that the current restrictions aren’t strict enough to fight the pandemic effectively. Minister Gantar’s party DeSUS has since left the coalition and a day later Gantar has resigned as Minister of Health. Minister Zdravko Počivalšek on Studio City show on 7 December 2020Link: https://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/studio-city/174737910 What is lockdown and why is the system not working? We contacted minister Počivalšek via e-mail to get further information on his statement. In his response to our questions, given to us by his PR team, minister Počivalšek stated that his claim is “based on the adopted government decrees, which during the exposed period prohibited, for example, movement between municipalities, gathering, movement at night, operation of many service activities, etc.” The Minister also said that the country has a thorough lockdown and this claim is based on “comparison with other countries in the region, where certain activities that were banned in our country were allowed, such as restaurants and bars and certain segments of trade (eg the sale of technical goods)”. He is acknowledging that other countries in the region also had thorough lockdowns but “by stating that the system is not working, it is crucial that despite the longest and most thorough “lockdown” compared to other countries in the region, we cannot see a reduction in the number of newly infected, hospitalized and people who need intensive care. Which is actually the basic purpose and goal of lockdown”. We did not get the exact answer from the minister on our question about the longevity of the lockdown in Slovenia. Furthermore, his PR team did not provide us with the names of the countries with which he made the comparison. As it is hard to say which measurement marks the beginning of lockdown in different countries it is also hard to state when the lockdowns started in different countries and, consequently, we can not compare the longevity across Europe with accuracy. As a result of all the differences it is difficult to establish a clear definition of lockdown. Even minister’s definition is vague. For further information about the effectiveness of measures in Slovenia we contacted the Head of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the the National Institute of Public Health but we did not get his answer. The Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Governments around the world all choose slightly different approaches to dealing with coronavirus outbreak. Because of the wide range of measures taken it is hard to compare different governments’ tactics in battling this pandemic. For the purposes of research and easier comparison of these measures around the world the researchers at Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford created a tool The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)    OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic on 18 indicators such as school closures and travel restrictions. It now has data from more than 180 countries. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid. Seven of the indicators (H1-H7) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime, emergency investments into healthcare and most recently, vaccination policies. The data from the 19 indicators is aggregated into a set of four common indices, reporting a number between 1 and 100 to reflect the level of government action. COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index on 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-12-07&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=World Comparing stringency indexes in Europe In his appearance on the show Počivalšek was talking about the second lockdown in Slovenia which officially started on 18th of October 2020 when the government declared an epidemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. On that date the stringency index for Slovenia was 47.22. Compared to some of the bigger countries in Europe on the same date Slovenia actually has one of the lowest stringency indexes. For example Spain had a stringency index of 64.35, Netherlands had 62.04, UK 60.19 and Austria 58.80. According to these numbers we can say that other countries in Europe actually had stricter measures in place before Slovenia declared the second start of the epidemic. COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index for Europe on 18 October 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-10-18&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=Europe However, policies change every day. Slovenia implemented stricter measures the next day so the stringency index jumped up to 64.81. By the 7th of December Slovenia did not have a big change in stringency index, it only went up by cca. four points (to 68.52).  As time went by, other countries also adapted their measures. For example, Spain had a stringency index of 71.30 (+6.95), UK had a stringency index of 66.67 (+6.48) and Austria which had a stringency index of 71.30 (+12.50).  COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index from 18 October to 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&time=2020-10-18..2020-12-07&country=SVN~DEU~FRA~GBR~ITA~NLD~SWE~GRC~ESP~AUT&region=Europe COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index for Europe on 7 December 2020Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index?stackMode=absolute&time=2020-12-07&country=AUT~FRA~DEU~GRC~ITA~NLD~SVN~ESP~SWE~GBR&region=Europe Conclusion In short, we can see that the original statement was vague and it did not state where on the spectrum Slovenia was located. Because of the constant changes in government measures around the world it is very hard to determine which country has the most thorough system or the longest lockdown. The word lockdown itself is vague and its meaning could differ between countries. For Europeans curfew could be the most thorough measure and most controversial while in other countries people do not oppose it. As our analysis shows measures taken in Slovenia have not deviated much from the measures adopted in other European countries across the autumn months. Thus, we confirm that the lockdown was indeed “thorough”, but it is not possible to confirm or debunk indefinetly whether it was also “one of the longest” because the lockdowns’ longevities are hard to estabilsh and compare across countries. On the basis of our analysis and reasoning of the factcheck, we find Počivalšek’s statement mostly true.

Children are put up for sale",2021-02-19,eufactcheck,,"Wpolitce.pl – a popular Polish right-wing news portal and TVP Info, a state news channel, report on alleged human trafficking taking place at Men Having Babies conference in Brussels. Misconception caused by terminology used in an article Due to the conservative predilection of the reporter – Grzegorz Górny – an article gains a tabloid tint. It is supposed to play on readers’ emotions and remain shocking. Thus the author calls an event Children’s Fair implying illegal child trafficking. It must be remembered that an event should be discussed according to surrogacy laws. It raises a question how the surrogacy law differs between Belgium and Poland where the article was published. Screenshot from the https://www.menhavingbabies.org  Despite that article of Grzegorz Górny is strongly biased on his opinion we decided that as fact-checkers we cannot deal with personal believes and we should focus on hard data instead. In order to acquire as much information about MHB as possible, we wrote and sent a letter to this institution. We found the email address on their website (menhavingbabies.org). Specifically we wanted to obtain some information about the so called “catalog prices”, as Wpolitice.pl is quite precise about the prices MHB “sells kids” for.  Prices are also mentioned in the article of “The Brussels Times”, which refers to American company International Surrogacy Center, which provides guidance and support for both surrogates and intended parents. Screenshot from the “The Brussels Times”, To our disappointment we didn’t receive any response from MHB, which is remarkable because MHB’s website provides many options to get in touch with them, depending on whether you’re a prospective client, member of the press or an independent researcher. Belgian legislation The author of the article was right about legal situation of surrogacy in Belgium. Numerous sources confirm that Belgian law do not regulate matter of surrogacy so it’s not prohibited or legalised.” Current Belgian legislation does not address the issue of surrogacy or of children born via surrogacy, In light of this legislative vacuum, the Belgian federal government has no choice other than to ignore any legal consequences of foreign documents created in this context (e.g. birth certificates or judgements). This position is adopted even if the local legal procedure has been followed meticulously abroad and the documents have been properly legalised or apostilled for use in Belgium. What results in legal implications abroad is not automatically recognised by the Belgian internal Rule of Law”. Case of surrogacy is the grey area of law. What happens in this grey area is beyond our ability as factcheckers.“Contrary to neighbouring countries, Belgium’s surrogacy laws have not been updated, meaning commercial surrogacy sits in a legal grey zone. Even though all political parties in Belgium are against it, it also mentioned that protestors were demanding a legal ban on all commercial promotion of surrogacy in Belgium.” “Currently, Belgium does not have specific legislation in matters of surrogacy. The nullity of surrogacy conventions results from the illegality of its object and its ’cause’, its opposition to the principles of non-availability of the human body and the civil status as well as the inalienable and non-available right of the mother who bears and gives birth to a child to determine parentage. However, some hospitals take advantage of the legislative gap to attend to requests of surrogacy. Doing so outside any legal framework, these hospitals have established strict rules to condition the practice of surrogacy”. Commercial character of the conference Due to the lacking statistics from MHB we can’t say how relations between participants and surrogacy agencies looked like. According to International Surrogacy Center (cited by “Brussel Times”) surrogate mother can expect about $55,000.00-$65,000.00 of compensation. At the same time in the article of “The Brussels Times”, the range of prices that candidates need to pay for a child: 90.000-150.000 euros.  At the International Surogacy Center website, there is an Agency Fee item where the Agency’s expenses are listed, but the Agency fee is not specified, in order to find it out, you need to contact the Agency:  Screenshot from  International Surrogacy Center website    According to point number nine of “Ethical framework” published by MHB: “Compensation guidelines for donors and surrogates may be legislated or encouraged in order to avoid unreasonably large sums that may lead to overwhelming financial incentives. While we do not think it is ethically necessary, we believe that it is reasonable for legislators or professionals to decide to enact or promote caps or guidelines for the compensation of surrogates and donors. It is reasonable to assume that such caps may reduce the likelihood that candidates will choose egg donation and surrogacy in the absence of sufficient altruistic motivation, and in circumstances that may lead to adverse long term medical or psychological outcomes. Therefore at the very least compensation guidelines should not be outlawed”. However, this ethical framework seems to be more of a suggestion from organizers than strict rule. In a situation when even legality of such event is not confirmed it’s not clear how this rule should be executed. Due to the  lack of demographic data we cannot exclude the possibility that such event is a financial opportunity for women from regions of EU where general income is much lower than in Belgium or USA. Language of the article Despite that general claims author of article – Grzegorz Górny were not so far from the truth we should stated that his rhetoric could be described as creating false impression that LGBT community stands behind international human traffic.  Using criteria of some scholars as Jana Laura Egelhofer and Sophie Lecheler  usage of strong words like “slavery of woman and trafficking of children” should be considered a manipulation, because of direct calling MHB a crime organization. Allegedly in this project there were involved women from poor countries (which wasn’t proven or denied in case of Brussel conference). “No woman would voluntarily agree to be treated as a breeding mare and to hire her uterus and give birth to a gay couple if she was not forced to do so by the dramatic financial situation. It is no coincidence that surrogates are recruited from very poor countries.” Screenshot from https://www.tvp.info/50725617/dzieci-na-sprzedaz-dla-homoseksualistow  The author of article also creates a false link between the fact that minister of foreign affairs is transgender and that such an event took place. This insinuate that Petra de Sutter was some somehow involved in preparation of such conference but didn’t give any further information for his argument. “In this light, the fact that recently, for the first time in the history of Europe, a transsexual woman became Deputy Prime Minister in Brussels is of new importance. This is the case of Petra de Sutter, an LGBT activist, who strongly demands the legalization of surrogacy in Europe” Everything seems to indicate that we are facing another battle in the cultural war, this time for the legal sanctioning of the austerity.”  Finally Grzegorz Górny places MHB conference in bigger context of endangered conservative values. “A few more years of such brainwashing and the attitude of the public will change. After all, we have already seen that what was treated as a deviation twenty years ago is now considered to be a cultural, social and legal norm. What was killing the helpless became a right for women. It is therefore possible that the surrogacy, i.e. slavery of women and trafficking in children, will also be considered a human right, and crowds will take to the streets to defend this right.”  Conclusion Despite that Grzegorz Górny didn’t give / use any false statistics, quotes or numbers his article should be labeled as a personal opinion due to the lack of specific information about subject of conference. Due to the opinion-forming nature of the article and its highly controversial subject we thought it is appropriate to highlight that this article is based on a conservative opinion (which we don’t criticise). References in the Russian media Many European media reacted to the topic, and the Russian media did not leave it aside. Russian conservative mass media didn’t leave the news about “children’s fair” unattended, although it didn’t become a great sensation. Perhaps the highest point this piece of news reached in russian media is the report by a state-run TV-company NTV. Reporter Anton Chechulinsky asked the participants of the MHB event for some comments including a surrogate mother. This report might seem to be unbiased, since every side of this conflict had their voices heard, but when it comes to the personal opinion of the reporter, which is brightly expressed in this material, it becomes clear, what kind of point the author is trying to make: “In contrast to those, who raise the children of the “third gender”, gays, Fabian and Mario, seem to raise their children in a more conservative way. Lily, their daughter, wears skirts and reads books about princesses. Jack, their son, doesn’t play with girlie toys and wears a baby shirt of a truly masculine colour – blue. One might think that these parents are the best at keeping their children away from stereotypes, but maybe they just want their children to become different to their parents in the future.” Russian Internet-media “Komsomolskaya Pravda” also put out an article about MHB conference in Brussels. Basically, this article is a recital of another article authored by Leone Grotti, a “Tempi” newspaper journalist. The author of this article, Tatyana Ogneva-Salvoni, doesn’t express her attitude to surrogacy and gays having babies directly, using her own words, but mixing the real facts about MHB conference with a pretty adamant opinion of another person doesn’t seem to be quite fair in terms of jornalism.

56,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-croatian-filmmaker-sulina-won-the-enviable-venice-film-festival-golden-lion-award/,Croatian filmmaker Šulina won the “enviable” Venice Film Festival Golden Lion award,2021-02-19,eufactcheck,,"News about a Croatian amateur film director Mr Mario Šulina receiving the Golden Lion award for his film “Adam” stirred controversy in Croatia. In December 2020 commercial TV channel RTL published on its webpage RTL.hr an article with the following title: ”’Golden Lion’ went to Đakovo this year: Director Šulina in the interview for RTL.hr reveals how ‘Adam’ won over the movie field in Venice, but not in Croatia“. Consequently, the news was published in many of the mainstream news outlets, almost always with comments and frowning upon domestic criteria which failed to recognize the value of the film. We have found this claim to be false. Headline published by news portal RTL.hr from December 01, 2020 To get the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival is indeed admirable achievement. The article on RTL website further states: “Although he received an enviable award on the Film Festival in Venice and is among favourites on movie festivals in Barcelona and Austria, it looks like he hasn’t received such success at home“. The director is quoted in the article saying: ”When 14 members of a jury with respectable bibliographies decided to give you in Venice the Golden Lion for directing a feature-length movie, then you know you did a great job.“ The film director Šulina got the most of media publicity after the mayor of his small town Đakovo organized a reception in his honour. The news and photo with title “Venetian Golden Lion in the little town hall” spread in the media and numerous Croatian media news outlets reported about the success of the unknown filmmaker. Also, Mr. Šulina was interviewed about his work and his success.  Some media problematized the “fact” that the film which tells the story of a Croatian War Veteran didn’t get any financial support from Croatian film funds and had never been invited to any of the Croatian Film festivals. In the first wave of articles published across Croatian media news outlets (mostly websites), no one checked if there was something misleading in the claim that a Croatian was awarded with the Golden Lion. Croatian web portals copy-pasted the news with no intention to dig deeper. Indeed, had they dedicated only one minute of research on Google, they would have easily found out that the official winner of the Venice International Film Festival Golden Lion for the 2020 was Nomadland by Chloe Zao,  and that there was something “suspicious” in that news. On the other hand, it is also true that no news media claimed that it was “the famous”  Mostra Internazionale Venice International Film Festival. But at the same time no media mentioned that there exists another festival with the similar name and the same award, and they failed to specify which award at which festival Mr Šulina had actually received. Nova TV is a Croatian television station which was declared as the most watched television station in Croatia for multiple years in a row. Mr Šulina posted an insert of this news on his Facebook profile in which Nova TV’s main evening news programme ‘Dnevnik’ reports on his award. Some days later, when news was already buried, Croatian film director Igor Mirković posted on his Facebook profile the outcome of his research what kind of “lion” it was, with the outcome turning out quite bizarre.  There is a small company under the name Venice Film Awards which awards prizes to the independent and less known filmmakers. Every month they give out dozens of awards. Due to the limited budget, every laureate who wants to have a statue as a proof for winning the award, pays 250 euros for it. So, the question is whether journalists who did not clarify that this was not the famous Golden Lion award, are simply superficial or they mislead the audience on purpose. How is it possible not to question the information when The Venice International Film Festival is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the most prestigious?. The other award with the same name – the Golden Lion – is awarded not annually but monthly on a different festival called the Venice Film Awards. At this festival there are about 800 award winners every year. Although RTL and other Croatian media did not directly say that Mr Šulina received the Golden Lion from The Venice International Film Festival, the publications lacked basic context about the actual award and created space for false assumptions that could be made by the audience.  Another factor which contributed to this false presentation is a photograph in which the awarded film maker poses with the award. The award he received is quite similar to the award given by the Venice International Film Festival. While there are obvious differences in the statue, an average reader would hardly be aware of this, and therefore again may be led to a wrongful conclusion. Screenshot from Mr Šulina’s Facebook status from November 26, 2020 The first Croatian online news outlet that ‘cleared the air’ was Index.hr, that published an article with the following headline: “Croatian film about veteran got the Golden Lion in Venice? Yes, the one that costs € 250”. Headline published by Index.hr on January 6, 2020  Index inserted a Facebook post of Croatian journalist and film director Mr Igor Mirković in which he publicly calls out Mr Šulina and Croatian media for the misinformation of the wider audience. Mr Šulina responded in a status on his Facebook account and said: ”On no occasion and in no medium did I mention the Golden Lion Award of the world-renowned Venice Film Festival. I have transparently highlighted participation and awards at the Venetian as well as at a number of other IMDBs qualifying festivals both on my own Facebook profile and on the film’s Facebook page. These are monthly independent film festivals including the controversial Venice film award one of the few at which the film has been awarded. The purchase of the statue, which also caused a controversy, is a matter of choice, but even without it, the fact is that the film was rated the best in the monthly selection and at the aforementioned independent film festival.“ Interesting enough, in the meantime, from the day we started our factcheck, the web page the Venice Film Awards has become inactive.   Conclusion Even though RTL and other Croatian media reported that Mr Šulina received a Golden Lion award, which is in a way indeed true, the context in which this information was presented is largely misleading. Therefore, this claim is assessed as false. Inadequate research and superficial reporting resulted in additional fame for the film maker, but no fame for Croatian journalism.

57,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-we-have-42-functional-illiterates-a-major-problem-for-romania/,"“We have 42% functional illiterates, a major problem for Romania”",2021-01-14,eufactcheck,,"Daniel David, professor of clinical cognitive sciences and the rector of Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, talked to the publisher of Clujul Cultural about the state of education in Romania. “[…] 42% of 15-year-olds are functionally illiterate. It is sad, because in three years those who are now 15 years old shall be the ones who vote, they will enter the field of work, they are the ones who start to run the society”, stated the renowned professor. Placing this problem in a larger context, studies have shown that, globally, more than 796 million people have literacy difficulties. As for Europe, one in five 15 year-olds has poor reading skills. Moreover, “it is estimated that around 13 million children under 15 years of age and around 55 million adults between 15 and 65 years of age have literacy difficulties”, according to Literacy in Europe: Facts and figures study. PISA scores (2018) show that Estonia ranks first in Europe, for Reading, Mathematics and Science, the last placed being represented by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Screenshot of Daniel David`s claim, published on Clujul Cultural Romanian context and previous official statements  Ecaterina Andronescu, former Minister of Education, has claimed in 2019, in a press inquiry answer, that “there is no definition, indicator or value associated at international level with the notion of functional illiteracy”, thus denying the phenomenon. The document was signed by the Press Office of the Institution. In the same time, another former Minister of Education, Monica Anisie, claimed, regarding PISA tests, that the results should not worry us, because they do not necessarily focus on what students know, but on how they apply the knowledge in their daily life. Although the representatives of the communist regime boasted that illiteracy was eradicated at that time, they did not consider the emergence of functional illiteracy, caused by school curricula that focused on satisfying political propaganda, and then the effective learning of students. The functional illiteracy was defined in 1978 by UNESCO: “A person is functionally illiterate who cannot engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his own and the community’s development.”. The same definition was used by OECD – The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1984. Unlike illiteracy, which involves the fact that the person does not know how to read, functional illiteracy takes into account those people who, although they can read, do not understand what they are reading or fail to perform basic mathematical operations. What do the previous studies show? According to a recent study issued by the European Commission regarding a statistical overview of Romania’s main education and training indicators, assessments show that over 40% of children have great difficulty performing simple mathematical operations, and their general knowledge about society, people and the universe is very limited. Key indicators, in “Education and Training Monitor 2019” At the same time, according to a EU Country Report, published in 2020, the education system in Romania continues to face significant challenges in terms of quality and inclusiveness, specifying that it is one of the countries with the highest share of low achievers among 15- year olds in all three areas tested under the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), more specifically 46.6% of 15-year-olds are underachievers in mathematics (EU average: 22.4%), 43.9% in science (EU average: 21.6%) and 40.8% in reading (EU average: 21.7%), which results in an average of 43.7%. 2020 European Semester, Country Report Romania On this occasion, we find out that there exists a Romanian Literature Association whose leader, Liliana Romaniuc, coordinates 2 programs to reduce functional illiteracy in which she works with teachers to improve their teaching method. In a press release she confirmed that Romania is ranking second to last among European countries regarding the area of ​​functional illiteracy, explaining that the main cause for this situation is the method of learning based on memorization and not on understanding the concepts. Conclusion In conclusion, according to most recent studies, conducted at European level, Romania remains in the last places when it comes to the ability of 15-year-old students to understand what they read or to solve simple math and science exercises.

58,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-emissions-of-bestselling-plug-in-hybrid-cars-are-higher-than-advertised/,“Emissions of bestselling plug-in hybrid cars are higher than advertised”,2021-01-13,eufactcheck,,"On the November 23 2020 Focus Association for Sustainable Development tweeted that: “Tests made by the Transport and Environment campaign group show that emissions of the three bestselling plug-in hybrid cars are 28–89% higher than advertised.” We rate it as true. In the tweet from the official account of Focus Association for Sustainable Development, the (unknown) manager of the team spoke about how the plug-in hybrids’ emissions of the three best-selling models are at least 28% higher than advertised. Because hybrids are supposed to be eco-friendly, we delved into this tweet to see if that’s actually the case. Namely, the Focus association concretely presented the research, in which it points out advertising based on incorrect data. In a way, they even accuses car manufacturers of their untruthfulness when selling their products. So doubt about this was also our guide for verifying this statement. A screenshot from the tweet by Focus Association During our research we have found out that Focus association have been studying climate change solutions since 2003, focusing especially on the energy sector, transport, consumption, global responsibility and equity. Within the framework of these studies, they implemented various national and European projects and activities that they consider a priority in the fight against climate change. That is why they are also members of several international NGO networks, including Transport and Environment campaign group, on which the tweet, that we are checking is based. They have at least eight experts from different fields, and they refer to the research they co-created. No thinking about charging Specifically, their tweet is based on the study of plug-in hybrids: Plug-in hybrids: Is Europe heading for a new Dieselgate?. They concluded this report that the BMW X5, Volvo XC60 and Mitsubishi Outlander based on Emissions Analytics company results are tested with 28–89 percent higher CO2 emissions than advertised in a full battery test and under optimal conditions. On all three models, three to eight times higher emissions than the official ones were measured with an empty battery, and when driving in battery charging mode, which could become more frequent due to charging before entering low-emission areas, the emission values were measured at tested plug-in hybrids 3–12  times higher. “It is easier for car manufacturers to meet EU standards in the field of car CO2 emissions by selling plug-in hybrids, ”as such vehicles currently receive additional benefit,” said Focus association in their response. “If plug-in hybrids are to aid the transition to zero-emission mobility in the 2020’s, urgent changes to EU lays are necessary to make sure that hybrids supplied on the EU market are not just compliance vehicles,” is written in conclusion of the report. Therefore they also point out that it happens that countries subsidize plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which many then buy without even thinking about charging. Improving situation Although the research was made independently and with association Transport & Environment (T&E) Society from Brussels, we couldn’t provide the final statement. That’s why we turned to Avto Magazin, one of the largest automotive magazines in Slovenia. Editor-in-Chief Matjaž Korošak presented us some facts about plug-in hybrids and shed some light on the researched statement. His view is that manufacturers have been following the needs of the market and looking for alternatives in technology due to increasingly restrictive legislation. These hybrids are supposed to be just an intermediate solution, until the way of charging Battery electric vehicles (BEV) and infrastructure is arranged as a solution for those who would like to go on a longer trip, but they do not have this plug-in. These are slightly different models, as they require a different mode of exploitation. If this is not the case, the results will be worse. Charging at home with moderate use, however, would not otherwise pose a major problem. Korošak also points out that until BEV technology is developed enough, the PHEV technology, about which they are talking, is the best solution. It is not ideal, but the situation is improving. We have also turned to Miloš Milač, an editor of avto.finance.si, to acquire even a greater understanding of the situation. Before turning to talk about the actual fact that we were trying to check, he pointed out that the statement made by Focus Association is “scandalous”. In that, he refers to the obviously different official advertising numbers in numerous different companies and fields not only in the hybrid / electric car industry. Official emissions numbers are lower also for fuel-powered cars, because companies prepare for them good and in optimized conditions. In the same way as laundry detergent official count can say it will do 50 washes, but you might end up doing just 35 or 40 of them. To this, he says: “Is this scandalous? Who will sue those manufacturers?” Different use of the car He concludes that the practical numbers can actually be even lower than advertised ones if you drive in the best conditions possible (for example: drive short city distances with charging stations both at work and at home). But as soon as you fall out of that frame you can experience higher numbers. Therefore, numbers might vary depending on the use of the car.  However, the real problem occurs, according to Milač, when we read into the legislation of the EU that deals with hybrid cars. He claims that first the official fuel consumption of hybrid cars is measured and later additionally altered. This is done by taking the official measurements and deliberately reducing them by 44% with the help of the mentioned legislation. This way officially (factory) measured 3.75 l / 100 km of driving (the example of the Mercedes-Benz C 350e) becomes only 2.1 l / / 100 km. Milač concludes that this of course is misleading information and might be the cause in popularity of plug-in hybrids. We have to add thought, that we have tried to check back with Milač and with our own research why such a law exists and how exactly it works, but have been unsuccessful in finding the law or getting an additional response. Conclusion We can conclude that the tweet is undoubtedly true. Many researches prove that under certain conditions emissions are higher than actually advertised. However, we have to point out that this is a standard practice in many different companies and fields and it is done under perfect conditions and full optimization of use (of any product). The biggest (and only) lie therefore becomes the EU’s alleged emission “optimization” that gives out false results. However, that does not directly influence the statement we checked, so we rate is as true.

59,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-football-referee-permanently-banned-for-racist-remarks/,Football referee permanently banned for racist remarks,2021-01-12,eufactcheck,,"On 13th of  December 2020 Dmitry Kiselyov, host of the Russian TV program “Vesti nedeli”, said that the Romanian soccer referee Sebastian Coltescu has been permanently banned from refereeing due to the fact that on 8th of December 2020 during the Istanbul-PSG match he said the word “negru” (which means “black”) regarding one of the players of Istanbul, while talking to the chief referee Ovidiu Hategan over the radio. Further, according to Kiselyov, the match was stopped, and the audience was asked to disperse.  Screenshot from Istanbul Basaksehir Twitter account Indeed, players from both teams accused Colcescu of racism and left the field as a sign of protest. However, on December 10th, Romanian journalist Emanuel Roşu posted a full transcript of the conversation between the participants of the scandal on his Twitter page. After studying all the available video recordings, Roşu found out that the word “negru” wasn’t uttered by Sebastian Coltescu, it was said by his assistant Octavian Sovre. But despite this, it was Coltescu who was accused of racism. It should be recalled, that the program of Dmitry Kiselyov was released on 13 December, three days after the investigation of Emanuel Roşu. Screenshot from www.upi.com But the thing that makes Kiselyov’s story completely inaccurate is that he claims that Sebastian Coltescu has been banned from refereeing permanently. Firstly, as of 25 December 2020 there is not a single publication on the Internet confirming that any official decision has been made with regard to the incident that took place on the 8th of December. Secondly, according to the rules of UEFA, which can be found on the UEFA web page, referees can be suspended for at least 10 matches, but given the circumstances revealed by Emanuel Roşu it is highly possible that Coltescu won’t be punished too harshly. Thirdly, suspending Coltescu permanently doesn’t make any sense because he was expelled from FIFA International Referees List two weeks before the incident. This season will be the last for Coltescu. Conclusion With all that being said, the claim of Dmitry Kiselyov about Sebastian Coltescu being permanently banned from refereeing is completely false.

60,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-government-measures-positively-affected-slovenian-employment-rating/,“Government measures positively affected Slovenian employment rating”,2021-01-04,eufactcheck,,"On 4 November 2020, Zdravko Počivalšek, Slovenian Minister of Economic Development and Technology, tweeted: “The assessments of the international financial institutions show that the measures taken so far have made it possible to maintain social stability and jobs.”  We rate this claim as mostly true. In a tweet from the official account of the Slovenian Minister of Economics Development and Technology, Zdravko Počivalšek, spoke about the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, specifically how the measures taken by the government positively affected Slovenian employment rating. After we contacted minister Počivalšek via e-mail, his team answered us rather quicky. Počivalšek’s team said that in the tweet the minister (who is also the author of the tweet) is referring to all economic and social measures that have been taken in order to help Slovenian economy. We point out just some of those measures for greater understanding in the next paragraph: Some of the measures taken by the government to mitigate the impact of the epidemic are as follows: those who lost their jobs during the epidemic receive temporary salary compensation; employers whose income will fall by more than 10 percent this year compared to 2019 are entitled to compensation of wages for workers; those self-employed whose income will fall by more than 10 percent this year compared to 2019 are entitled to a monthly basic income and exemption from social security contributions; students receive one-time solidarity aid in the amount of EUR 150; tourist vouchers for all residents of Slovenia (adults EUR 200, minors EUR 50), estimated at EUR 345 million; introduction of a mobile health protection application for informing about contacts with infected people; Partial coverage of fixed costs to the companies most affected by the epidemic etc. Credit rating agencies To explain coronavirus’s impact on Slovenian economy, we must begin with the fact that the Slovenian government has declared pandemic twice and offered help packages to certain economic subjects (the content of those packages was partly described in the previous paragraph). The indicators of economic activity in Slovenia have improved markedly since May and indicate a strong rebound in the third quarter, but in August and September the recovery already slowed considerably in most sectors. With the worsening of the epidemiological situation in September and October, confidence indicators indicate uncertainty about further recovery. The European Commission has forecast that Slovenia’s economy would contract by 7.1% this year, roughly on par with its previous estimate. A rebound of 5.1% is expected in 2021. However, as explained by his team – the claim made by minister Počivalšek was based on the assessments of the financial institutions, such as Fitch, Moody`s, DBRS Morningstar and Standard & Poor`s. A credit rating agency is a company that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor’s ability to pay back debt by making timely principal and interest payments and the likelihood of default. The government has posted all four on its official webpage, but as you can see if you open the following links – Fitch, Moody`s, DBRS Morningstar and Standard & Poor`s – there were just a few information. That is why we also checked original articles on webpages of original authors, which are hyperlinked in the first sentence. From that we could conclude that mentioned financial institutions had given Slovenia either a good stable rating or even improved it. As this does show overall good economic state that Slovenia is in – it does not necessarily reflect the state of unemployment and “social stability” as defined by Počivalšek’s team (in short: they claim social stability means that the income of the citizens had stayed more or less the same or has not drastically decreased). In Fitch ratings, it was stated that “The improving outlook is in part due to the effective containment measures that allowed a relatively short period of lockdown and to the authorities’ extensive support programmes”, and also added that “overall, we expect only a moderate increase in unemployment in 2020, to 6.8% from 4.5% in 2019, still well below the previous peak of 10.2% in 2013.” Which confirms what Počivalšek has claimed, although it has no mention of “social stability” (also no other research mentions social stability) as well as no undisputedly clear correlation between government measures and rate of unemployment. Two other assessments were not freely accessible, so we could not examine them further, and the fourth research had no mention of social stability or unemployment data.  A screenshot of the tweet by Zdravko Počivalšek, Slovenian Minister for of Economic Development and Technology  Employment ratings got better Because the first part did not give us enough relevant information to reach conclusions, we have reached out to Employment service of Slovenia, where we got some relevant data. At the start of the pandemic in Europe in spring, unemployment started to rise in Slovenia (see Figure 1). But then since July it started to drop and has been dropping ever since. Although the drop was not so fast as the rise, the official published numbers show, that it actually got better in the field of employment again. Figure 1 was generated on the basis of the data from the Website of Employment service of Slovenia.  Economist analysis Since we still did not have any information about improvement on the field of social stability, we also contacted economist and professor at the Faculty of Economic Ljubljana Jože P. Damijan, who is also candidate for prime minister in the possible upcoming technical government, supported by opposition parties. He said: “Počivalšek’s claim about jobs is true, since his analysis shows low correlation between the intensity of measures taken and growth of unemployment. Closing of public life and lockdown have not been followed by immediate growth of unemployment. Despite that manufacturing has been decreased because of the situation, people did not lose jobs. All that because the efficiency of the measures taken by a lot of governments, such as compensation at salary for those that are on standby from work, co-financing of firms and subsidizing of part-time work. That has given the employers the chance to keep their workers and not let them go. But this effects temporary and time limited, because government will not finance firms forever. So, when that stops, the firms will be forced to let workers go, especially at firms which will recover slowly. That is also the reason, that percent of unemployment raised till June and started falling afterwards.” Conclusion In short, the assessments of financial institutions, which we got during the research, have shown, that Slovenia got positive evaluation on field of economics. But it did not strictly connect with employment rates and social stability. Furthermore, additional research has shown, that field of unemployment actually got better, so we can conclude that it also upgraded social stability in the country. Still, information gained during process cannot confirm Počivalšek’s claim 100%. Therefore, we graded it as mostly true.

61,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-concept-of-global-warming-was-created-by-and-for-the-chinese-in-order-to-make-us-manufacturing-non-competitive/,The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,2020-12-25,eufactcheck,,"In this fact check we looked at one of many highly controversial Tweets about climate change posted by US president Donald J. Trump. In November of 2012 he stated that “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. We have found this claim to be false. While in 2012 Trump was still far away from his Presidency and it seemed unlikely, the impact of his claims – this one included – sheds light on his further stands and actions towards both climate change and U.S.’s relationship with China.  Climate Change Is Real We believe it is important to note the difference between “weather” and “climate change.” The weather changes constantly since it is dependant on many different factors, which wrongfully gives footing to confused climate change deniers. When we say “climate change” we are referring to what the Oxford Dictionary describes as “changes in the Earth’s weather, including changes in temperature, wind patterns, and rainfall, especially the increase in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere that is caused by the increase of particular gases, especially carbon dioxide “. An overwhelming majority of the scientific community agrees that global warming is real, one of them being Naomi Oreskes, Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. In year 2016 Oreskes and associates completed the Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human caused global warming which compiled the conclusions of over 12.000 papers analysing expert opinions on climate change. In this paper they concluded that 90 to 100% of climate scientists think that humans are the main cause of the recent global warming phenomenon. Many other concerned climate scientists are doing their part in providing proof that global warming is real and a danger to us all. While climate scientists may be in agreement, the same cannot be said for Donald Trump. In 2012 Trump said global warming was created by and for Chinese manufacturing, but have his attitudes and accusations changed since then? Over the last eight years, Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a Chinese hoax, then denied saying that and went back and forth about it. In 2013 he tweeted  that global warming is a hoax and three years later denied ever saying that. While he donated money to fight climate change back in 2014, in 2017, after he had sworn as U.S. President, he made cuts to climate change research and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney called  it “a waste of money”. In 2018 Trump claimed he doesn’t think it’s a hoax, but doesn’t know that it’s manmade. One of the best pieces of evidence showing that Donald Trump doesn’t understand global warming or its implications for humankind, is his decision to exit the Paris Climate Accord in 2017 which he justified by stating he was “doing what is fair for the US”. In his forementioned speech he claimed to be doing so in order to save the jobs of people working in the “dirty industries”, however it would appear he hasn’t even managed that, all the while keeping the infamous title of the world’s second worst polluter, right behind China. It was not made by or for the Chinese As is evident by now, global warming is not a political tool invented by the Chinese, it has a strong scientific background. So why did Donald Trump accuse China of making it up? Let’s look at the facts. Manufacturing is crucial for both China and the US. A chart by Statista shows that in 2018, China accounted for 28% of global manufacturing output, placing the country on top of the world manufacturing, while US took second place with 16.6%. When speaking about each country’s manufacturing individually, according to manufacuring.gov it is the fourth largest industrial sector in the US, representing about 11% of the gross domestic product. Records from October 2020 show that 15.6 million or 4.8% Americans are employed in the manufacturing sector. As for China, manufacturing made up 46.2% of their 2014 GDP and employed about 400 million people, or 30% of the workforce. While it is a known fact that the US and China are in an intense rivalry when it comes to manufacturing, it is unlikely that global warming was created to make the US manufacturing non-competitive. According to Forbes, climate change will have some negative effects on manufacturing in the US, but those effects can only hit China, the number one manufacturer, even worse. The Relationship Between US and China               The relationship between these two forces is far too complex and layered to be fully explained in just a few sentences, since it spans over more than 7 decades. They just never seemed to be on the same side, from the Korean War to the handling of the Covid crisis. The US struggled with maintaining a positive attitude towards China as it stomped across Asia in its “One China” program. One example of the confusion the US faced, and propagated, during these times is the issuing of The Six Assurances to Taiwan the same year they signed the Joint Communique with the People’s Republic of China. In October of 2000 things were seemingly looking up, with US President Bill Clinton signing the US-China Relations Act which normalized trade relations between the two countries. It was all going swimmingly until China announced an almost 18% increase in military expenditures, and it certainly didn’t help that just one year later it surpassed Japan as the largest US foreign creditor, only to take the US’s spot as the world’s leading economy in 2010. In 2012 China got new leadership, and president Xi Jinping seemed keen to develop a positive relationship with then-president Barack Obama. The US and China appeared to be on the same page. Even after the 2016 elections in the US that resulted in Donald J. Trump becoming president, the relationship between the two forces remained stable, at least until 2018 and the start of a trade war between them. The deterioration of their relationship continued in 2019, as the US accused China of being a currency manipulator. The feud later extended into areas such as technology when the US placed the company Huawei on entity list, which made it more difficult for Chinese tech moguls to do business with US companies. One of the most recent conflicts involved the failure of US engagement with China. The US Secretary Mike Pompeo delivered a speech where he mentioned a few reasons why the engagement really failed, namely the repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, blows to the economy and intellectual property theft.   Conclusion We haven’t found one shred of evidence to support Donald Trump’s tweet about China manufacturing global warming. Finding evidence about the existence of global warming wasn’t that hard, since Oxford Dictionary offers a good explanation of this concept and professors from Harvard University wrote a paper supporting the thesis. Our conclusion is that this statement was false. It was a product of several decades of tense international relationships between the US and China that never really ended. While these two countries are the two biggest manufactures in the world, no sane person would ever believe one of them created global warming, let alone tweet about it. While it is certainly good that we have the freedom of speech in the modern world, in our opinion, this should not apply to high profile individuals who have the power to sway the minds of millions.

62,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-pope-francis-endorses-same-sex-civil-unions-in-documentary-francesco/,Pope Francis endorses same-sex civil unions in documentary “Francesco”,2020-12-18,eufactcheck,,"In October, several newspapers published articles with headlines like “Pope Francis backs same-sex civil unions“. The claim is based on previously undisclosed footage from an interview with Pope Francis in the new documentary “Francesco” which we have watched for our fact check. After extensive research we assess the claim as mostly false. “Francesco” is a documentary film about the life and the impact of Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio). It was directed by Evgeny Afineevsky and released in October 2020. The documentary has incited a bit of an uproar and caused a lot of controversy because of the previously undisclosed footage from an interview with Pope Francis. The documentary can be divided into twelve storylines. They mostly start with a problem that has arisen. It then gets connected to Pope Francis and mostly he is the one to solve or at least soothe the conflict. The big scandal of child abuse within the Catholic Church in Argentina and one of the victims, Juan Carlos Cruz, receive a lot of attention and are very important for the documentary. After the film analysis we came to the conclusion that the documentary supports a certain image of the pope: down-to-earth, empathic and very humble. This image is also supported by the stylistic devices used including the music and the emotional character of the documentary.  Headlines, published in newspaper BBC News and TV channel Euronews from October 21, 2020.  Headlines, published in TV channel ABC News and newspaper The New York Times from October 21, 2020 Helping the viewer establish the Pope’s attitude towards same-sex couples, the documentary tells the story of Andrea Rubera who adopted three children with his male partner. He came to see the Pope and asked him if it is okay to bring his children into the church. The documentary doesn’t show the conversation between Rubera and Pope Francis but cuts to a different scene instead: We see Pope Francis talking in a setting which looks like an interview. The subtitles of the documentary offer a translation of what he said: “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it. What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are all legally covered. I stood up for that.” Based on those quotes, it seems that he accepts same-sex couples/families and endorses the legal recognition of civil unions. Screenshot from a scene in the documentary “Francesco” Clarification from the Vatican? The film provoked numerous reactions from the audience after its release and got a lot of press, mainly because of the quotes regarding civil unions and homosexuality. Apparently, the Vatican reacted by delivering a message to bishops around the world in order to explain the Pope’s view on civil unions. This is revealed in a letter from Archbishop Christophe Pierre to all Bishops in the United States asking for “cooperation in this matter”. The letter, translated by Bishop McManus, says that the Pope’s words are taken out of the context and that the statements were not from an interview with the film’s director, but from a 2019 interview with a Mexican journalist. According to Pierre, the Pope was asked two different questions of which the answers were combined, edited and then published in the film as one answer, but without proper context. The specific statement, therefore, according to the letter, referred to the general acceptance and respect of every person, not necessarily homosexual, and to the rights of these people to have certain legal protection.  Screenshot from catholicfreepress.org The letter further states that several years ago, the Pope clearly stated and agreed to the definition of marriage as a union of man and woman, and that in general he “referred to certain provisions of different states, and certainly not to the teachings of the Church”.  However, we take this letter with a grain of salt as there is no evidence that the letter is original because it wasn’t officially released for the public. We have asked the Holy See Press Office for clarification but unfortunately did not get a reply. The difference between civil unions and marriage It’s important to note that there is a difference between civil unions and marriage. According to an official website of the European Union “civil marriage is a legal status recognized in all EU countries.” Marriage comes with certain rights that civil unions do not grant. Only some EU countries allow same-sex couples to get married. In the controversial quote, Pope Francis uses the words “ley de convivencia civil” which translate to “civil union law”. He speaks of civil unions, not marriage. The Pope also said that accepting gay family members or accommodating same-sex partnerships in civil law “does not mean approving of homosexual acts” and that he believes that same-sex couples shouldn’t be allowed to marry. The context of the Pope’s statement After watching the documentary we can confirm that the controversial statements by the Pope about creating civil union laws were taken from the interview with Mexican television that we mentioned above. There’s a video on YouTube that shows nearly one hour and 18 minutes from the 2019 interview between Pope Francis and Valentina Alazraki of the Mexican television station “Televisa”. We noticed that it is the same setting and background (as the scene in “Francesco”). It is very important to note that the controversial quote in the documentary (“What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are all legally covered.”) is missing from the broadcast. In a letter to the Washington Post, a Televisa spokesman confirmed that the civil unions quote are indeed from the 2019 interview and that the Vatican removed them from the broadcast. Apparently, the Mexican channel wasn’t allowed to publish an uncensored full version of the interview. We can only guess why those statements were cut out: Maybe they were left out because they would provoke (unwanted) public reactions.   There’s a video on YouTube that shows nearly one hour and 18 minutes from the 2019 interview between Pope Francis and Valentina Alazraki of the Mexican television station “Televisa”. It is debatable if the statements that appear in the movie (cut from the original broadcast of the interview) are taken out of context. But it is safe to say that the Pope’s intentions would be clearer if the documentary displayed the quotes in the full context. That is why we checked the interview uploaded on YouTube to see if it gives us a better understanding of what Pope Francis meant. In the interview, the Pope answers several questions regarding the topic of homosexuality. Referring to a previous conversation with reporters while he was on a plane, the Pope says that the media coverage of his answers made him angry. To defend himself from what was written in the media he clarifies that he never meant that homosexuals should be sent to a psychiatrist. He quotes himself: “They asked me the same question again and I repeated: They are children of God, they have a right to a family and that’s it.” The journalist then says that the people who knew him while he was Archbishop in Argentina called him “conversative” and now as Pope he has supposedly turned “liberal”. She asks him if he recognizes himself in this description. Pope Francis replies: “I have always defended the doctrine. And it’s strange, in the same-sex marriage law… it is an incongruity to speak of same-sex marriage.” He continues that he has evolved and grown as a person. Seeing the troubles of the world, he became more conscious of things he wasn’t conscious of before. He is a mixture of everything. He wants to preserve the sanctity of church values but also he has evolved and understands things more. The journalist says it’s difficult to categorize a person in only one box and he agrees. How do Pope Francis’ remarks fall in line with his previous statements? Although having a homosexual orientation is not seen as a sin, homosexual acts are still regarded as sinful by the Catholic Church. Homosexual people are called to chastity to this day, as it is laid out in the “Catechism of the Catholic Church“. Both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI have made condemning statements regarding same-sex marriage. Pope Francis has commented on same-sex marriage and homosexuality on various occasions in the past. As Cardinal, he made very critical statements about “the project of the law regarding marriage of persons of the same sex” and called it a “”movement” of the father of lies” in the letter to the Carmelite Nuns of Buenos Aires in 2010. His famous quote “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?” dates back to 2013 when he spoke to reporters on a flight back from Brazil. He also said “The key is for the church to welcome, not exclude, and show mercy, not condemnation” and “The problem is not having this orientation. We must be brothers” which complies with the official teaching of the Catholic Church.   Conclusion After watching the documentary and the broadcasted interview from 2019, looking for clarifying official statements by the Catholic Church, the Vatican, the Archbishops and Pope Francis’ previous remarks, we have to admit that it was hard to determine a final result for the factcheck. Does the Pope endorse same-sex civil unions? We have established that the original broadcast of the interview with Valentina Alazraki has been subject to censorship by the Vatican. The controversial quote which led to the media uproar only came to light as part of the release of the documentary. The Vatican has used methods like censorship in order to control the public image of the Pope but the director of the documentary used his methods to support a certain image of the Pope as well. He has combined two answers from two different points of the same interview and edited them in such a way that it supports an open-minded, emphatic and progressive image of Pope Francis and left out the context of his statements on same-sex civil unions. In order to assess the claim “Pope Francis endorses same-sex civil unions” as true, we would need to hear it directly from him – without the director editing the answers and leaving out the context and without the Vatican’s censorship. As we don’t have that, we assess the claim as mostly false. Saying that the Pope backs or endorses civil unions is an interpretation made by the media, but it is by no means supported by a Pope’s direct claim that’s presented in full and clear context.

On November 12, 2020, Sergey Lavrov, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, held a press conference with Russian and foreign media on topical issues on the international agenda. During the interview, a foreign journalist was asked about the Navalny case, as a result of which, France and Germany imposed sanctions against Russia.  Screenshot of the press on VGTRK conference where Minister Lavrov stated the claim. Russian news Agency (TASS) reports that Russia is introducing retaliatory (“mirror”) sanctions against Germany and France because of the “Navalny case”. This was announced by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a press conference with the media. Screenshot of the article on TASS. European Union, represented by Germany and France, imposed sanctions against Russian Federation on the Navalny case: this applies to six individuals and the research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology. The document notes that the sanctions were imposed for violation of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. The sanctions are published in the official Journal of the European Union on October 15, 2020. To check whether the information published by TASS  is reliable, we turned to Russian Foreign Ministry official website , but did not find any regulations or instructions related to the establishment of sanctions against Germany and France. On the TASS portal, the material contains a video from a press conference in which Sergey Lavrov explains the situation that happened to the Director of the anti-corruption Fund Alexey Navalny, but it also does not contain information that Russia is imposing sanctions against the two mentioned countries. The article quotes the head of the Foreign Ministry: “They (sanctions) have already been adopted. We will soon inform our German and French colleagues about this. These sanctions will be imposed on senior employees of the offices of the leaders of Germany and France,” Lavrov said. But no official document was published. Thus, we can conclude that the statement published on the Internet portal of the TASS news Agency is mostly false, since it is possible that the official document has not yet been published for some reason.

64,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-russian-academic-excellence/,“Russian universities fail to offer world class education”,2020-12-15,eufactcheck,,"“Generation 0-100: Russian Universities Fail to Offer World Class Education” – our team found an article with this headline on the website of “The National Interest” magazine dated October 29, 2020. Indeed, Russian universities did not manage to get into the top 100 best universities in the world. However, higher educational institutions raised their positions in the overall ranking. The statement of the checked article can be regarded as mostly true. Part of a whole Ararat Osipian, the author of the material, a researcher at the Institute of International Education, claims that Russian universities are not able to provide a proper education and enter the 100 best educational institutions in the world. As an argument, he cites the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Project 5-100. The goal: at least five Russian universities should be among the top 100 best universities in the world by 2020. The material of Mr. Osipian contains some inaccurate data. Indeed, the official order of Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, of May 7, 2012 includes a clause stating that 5 Russian universities should enter the top hundred of the world’s leading universities according to world university rankings. But, this is only an aspect of the Decree “On measures to implement state policy in the field of education and science”. The source is the official site of the Project 5-100. As for the philosophy of the project, the goal of 5-100 – to maximize the competitive position of a group of leading Russian universities in the global market of educational services and research programs. World overall rankings Mr. Osipian also writes about the positions of Russian universities in the world ranking, noting that only 21 higher educational institutions were included in the top 500. However, the author did not analyze changes in the positions of universities with regard to other general authoritative rankings. Based on the material with information on the rankings of educational institutions on the Forbes Education website, one can trace how Russian universities appear and rise in the lists. The rankings to aim for are determined by the task of the project itself. These are the three most prestigious and authoritative rankings of universities in the world – Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), Times Higher Education (THE) and Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU or Shanghai ranking). – Times Higher Education included 400 Russian universities in 2015, and by 2020 – more than 1000. – ARWU more than doubled the number of participants: from 500 in 2016 to 1000 in 2019. – QS contained 800 universities in 2014, and 1000 in 2020. In addition, the dynamics of Russian universities is mostly positive, as evidenced by the charts compiled by rankings. Dynamics of Russian Universities in QS World University Rankings. Source: QS World University Rankings Dynamics of Russian Universitie in Shanghai World University Rankings. Source: Forbes Russia Dynamics of Russian Universitie in Times Higher World University Rankings. Source: Forbes Russia Rankings by Subject Another omission of the author is Subject Rankings. Ararat Osipian relies only on the general summary, but claims about the failure of universities in general. In turn, Russian universities improve their performance not only by the quantity, but also by the quality of individual subject areas.  According to the source, the number of Russian universities in the top 100 best universities in the world under the version of the Shanghai Subject Ranking (ARWU) has grown from six to eight (the ranking was updated in 2019). In total, this list includes 15 Russian universities. It should be noted that the Shanghai ranking includes more than 4,000 universities in the world in 54 subjects in such areas of knowledge as Natural and Engineering Sciences, Life Sciences, Medical and Social Sciences. For example, the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI, which moved from position 151-200 to position 101-150, and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, which moved from position 201-300 to 151-200, demonstrated significant growth in the area of Physics. Among the newly added universities that were included in the ranking are Tomsk Polytechnic University, which took position 76-100 in the subject area “Mechanical Engineering”, and ITMO University – position 76-100 in the subject area “Automation and Control”. There were outsiders too, of course. For example, MSU dropped one position in the subject ranking in Physics, taking 45th place, and left the 51-75 group, taking 76-100 in the field of “Mathematics”. The overall dynamics in the ranking is positive, and Russian universities continue to increase their performance and hone their subject areas. Conclusion In short, our research has shown that the statement “Russian universities fail to offer world class education” is mostly true. The author of the article in The National Interest magazine outlined the point of the request not as a part, but as a whole, which is not entirely correct. Another important omission was that the author formed a limited perception about the development of Russian universities due to the fact that he did not take into account the subject rankings of world universities.

65,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-pfizer-waited-on-purpose-to-announce-the-news-about-the-vaccine-after-u-s-elections/,Pfizer waited on purpose to announce the news about the vaccine after U.S. elections,2020-12-07,eufactcheck,,"Did Pfizer wait on purpose? After the US elections, a prominent Croatian RTL TV news anchor Zoran Šprajc, made a comment in  one of the most watched news shows in Croatia called RTL Direkt, assuming that the bio-pharmaceutical company Pfizer waited on purpose for the end of the elections to publish news about the vaccine against Covid-19. However, Pfizer gave reliable data and reasons for the exact date of publishing the results. Therefore, Mr Šprajc’s statement is assessed as false.  Anchor’s intro in the Croatian news show RTL Direkt in November was as follows: “And if you’re wondering why Pfizer waited for the U.S. election to be over to announce this sensationally good news, let’s also recall the fact that Trump forced the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices, and thus knocked out billions of dollars in profits, so they weren’t really  interested to announce the news on the eve of the election. On the other hand, we can expect that the new US administration will know how to return the favour to the pharmaceutical industry, and the American brothers will probably soon pay dearly for their medicines again.” In this claim, the RTL (Croatian TV channel which is part of the RTL group) anchor Zoran Šprajc, used his role as a host of the popular news show, to speculate on the basis of the president Trump’s claims in which he accused pharmaceutical industry Pfizer for waiting on purpose with the results, although it was him who invested in the research of vaccine through the operation Warp Speed. Research Pfizer and BioNTech released the first results of a study on the COVID-19 vaccine on November 9th, confirming that the results of the group that received the vaccine compared to the one that received placebo were positive in more than 90 percent of cases. As the results of the third phase were announced some days after the US election held on 3rd November, the press release was a trigger for the series of attacks coming from President Trump who refused acknowledging Joe Biden’s victory. Furthermore, the vaccine announcement was a trigger for number of President Trump’s posts attacking pharmaceutical company Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which could be found on Trump’s Twitter profile. One of them is: “As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn’t have the courage to do it before. Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives! None of Trump’s tweets are evidence-based.  It is important to mention that President Trump often repeated in public that the vaccine would be ready for use before the election. This could be interpreted as an attempt to secure more votes in his favour. Also, his daughter Ivanka Trump, his son, Donald Trump Jr., Vice President Mike Pence, and radio host Mark Levin were among those publicly celebrating the news about the vaccine as a victory of president’s Operation Warp Speed. Mike Pence tweeted that the news about vaccine came “thanks to the public-private partnership forged” by Mr Trump. Warp Speed is an agreement between US government and pharmaceutical companies in order to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.  In July, it was announced that up to $1.95 billion in funds will be given to Pfizer for the large-scale manufacturing and nationwide distribution of 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate. According to Business Insider, that means that Warp Speed bought 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccines before the results came in. Still, on 8th November, Pfizer claimed it wasn’t part of the operation. “We were never part of the Warp Speed,” the Pfizer Vice President Kathrin Jansen said to New York Times “We have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.”   After Pfizer’s initial claim to the New York Times that it had never been part of Operation Warp Speed,   Pfizer Spokesperson Sharon Castello’s email statement to CNN says it is not entirely true. „”Pfizer is one of various vaccine manufacturers participating in Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine,” Castillo said: “While Pfizer did reach an advanced purchase agreement with the U.S. government, the company did not accept (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) funding for the research and development process. All the investment for R&D was made by Pfizer at risk. Dr Jansen was emphasizing that last point.” Although it is true that they signed a distribution agreement with the US government for the purpose of improving availability of vaccines, Pfizer said they invested their own money into research. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained the reason behind that decision for CBS News on 13th September for not taking US tax-payers money for the research: “The reason why I did it was because I wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy. When you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. I didn’t want to have any of that. I wanted them- basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way”.  Also on the 13th of November, President Trump gave an update on the Operation Warp Speed,  still insisting that Pfizer was misinterpreting the fact: “Pfizer said it wasn’t part of Warp Speed, but that turned out to be a unfortunate misrepresentation.  They are part.  That’s why we gave them the $1.95 million — billion dollars.  And it was an unfortunate mistake that they made when they said that.“ Even though Pfizer stuck to the fact that they never took US federal money for the research, it was not entirely true that they were not part of the Operation Speed at all.  Obviously, there is more nuance in the Pfizer – US Government relationship. According to the CNN Factcheck, if the company had a major agreement to sell at least 100 doses of its vaccine to the federal government and Pfizer acknowledged, this can be be interpreted as „participating“ in Operation Warp Speed through this deal. But this doesn’t prove the assumption that Pfizer and BioNTech waited on purpose. Those who think that Pfizer was waiting to announce the results after the election, also rely on earlier statements by Pfizer CEO Albert Burla. In an interview with the NBC Today Show on 8th September, Bourla said that that Pfizer would only submit a vaccine for authorization “when we have evidence of safety and efficacy.” He predicted that Pfizer would have an answer by the end of October 2020. On 27th October Burla ruled out that they would have a vaccine ready before election date.  According to Burla, they still lacked trial data and had not yet reached the number of 32 cases out of 44.000 participants reported cases of infection among participants. These data arrived on 5th or 6th November, and then an independent committee of experts analyzed all the characteristics of the vaccine and the data obtained from the research. On 18th November, at the New York Times press conference, almost 2 weeks after the US election, CEO Burla stated clearly “We didn’t conspire with anyone. (…) We didn’t delay vaccine results until after elections”. To verify the claim, on 11th November,  the online publication  Science, made a factcheck on all steps in the process and found no evidence for claims that vaccine result was surpressed to sway elections. Another speculation linked to the claim we are factchecking, is given in the same intro by the RTL Direkt host Mr Zoran Šprajc. He says that the reason for the delay of the vaccine announcement is the fact that Trump’s administration forced the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices and thus knocked out billions of dollars in profits. for this, according to Mr Šprajc, they didn’t want to announce the news on the eve of the election.   The anchor then speculates that the new US administration would return the favor to the pharmaceutical industry by rising drug prices again. According to some factchecks quoted by NBC news,  there’s no evidence that Trump’s policies have meaningfully lowered drug prices, as he has repeatedly claimed. The RTL Direkt anchor made a speculation that Pfizer waited to announce the vaccine results because they expected the financial award from the new US Government. The comment was not based on any previous research. Also, no TV story followed this introduction by the anchor that would give more information and background for Mr Šprajc’s claims.   Conclusion The comment given in the RTL Direkt news by the prominent anchor Zoran Šprajc is therefore false. Pfizer clearly stated the reasons for announcing the results on that particular day and the company distanced itself from political influence. With all speculative hints of Trump and his supporters on Twitter, it can be dangerous to pass on a story without checking facts. Pfizer explained even before the election day that the result of the research could be delayed and there was no reason to link them to political calculations. Even more, the host of the show used his position to make further speculations assuming that the reasons for the delay is the pharmaceutical industry expectations that the new US Government would award them with the rise of the drug prices. For the host of one of the most watched news shows in the country it is irresponsible to make such assumption without any backup.  RTL Direkt news show has a wide audience and the comments of the popular host are often shared.  After the show, many smaller web portals and social networks published and shared the video with Zoran Šprajc’s comment. Such speculations can create a stigmatized image of the new vaccine and jeopardize the already shaken public confidence in the pharmaceutical industry caused by numerous conspiracy theories.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Vera Kadijević & Josipa Mandurić","https://www.rtl.hr/vijesti-hr/korona/3922706/evo-zasto-je-pfizer-cekao-kraj-izbora-sigurno-ce-braca-amerikanci-znati-uzvratiti-uslugu/,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-covid-vaccine-a-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel.html,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325961445062938625,https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/1325794339335921667,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/22/us-government-engages-pfizer-produce-millions-doses-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/operation-warp-speed-us-coronavirus-vaccine-program-pfizer-moderna-2020-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/fact-check-pfizer-warp-speed-pence/index.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-pfizer-ceo-dr-albert-bourla-on-face-the-nation-september-13-2020/,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/fact-check-pfizer-warp-speed-pence/index.html,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-update-our-us-covid-19-vaccine-candidate,https://www.today.com/video/pfizer-ceo-on-coronavirus-vaccine-we-will-have-an-answer-by-the-end-of-october-91234885714,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-pfizer-election-idINKBN27X2N3,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/fact-check-no-evidence-supports-trump-s-claim-covid-19-vaccine-result-was-suppressed,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html,https://www.instagram.com/",Pfizer waited on purpose to announce the news about the vaccine after U.S. elections,,,,,,
66,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-solar-energy-is-now-cheapest-source-of-energy-in-history/,“Solar energy is now cheapest source of energy in history”,2020-12-04,eufactcheck,,"Greenpeace Slovenia tweeted via their account on 27 October 2020, claiming that “It’s official now – the solar energy is the cheapest source of energy in history!”. This is mostly true.  Slovenian Greenpeace organization posted on their Twitter account stating that solar energy is from now on officially the cheapest source of energy in history. They included a link to a web article by Popular Mechanics that was their main source. The article itself then refers to another link that refers to a summary by Carbon Brief of a report from IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2020 as the primary source.    Source: Twitter Greenpeace Slovenia https://twitter.com/greenpeacesi/status/1320995727682789376  When asked about their primary source, Greenpeace Slovenia provided many sources, all confirming their statement. Greenpeace International first posted the claim and they have a high level of trust for the organization and did not further check the source. To confirm the statement, a secondary expert from the Energy Efficiency Centre at Jozef Stefan Institute was contacted. The Centre is mainly oriented in the fields of energy efficiency, RES, reduction of GHG emissions and reduction of air pollutants. Their expert support is employed by Ministries for preparation of strategic and action documents in projects of energy consumption development, making them competent experts to be consulted regarding solar energy. According to them, the primary source (IEA’s report) is a reliable and trustworthy source to cite from. In the IEA’s report it is stated that solar is now the cheapest form of electricity for utility companies to build. That is due to risk-reducing financial policies around the world and it applies to locations with both the most favorable policies and the easiest access to financing. The statement itself can be a bit problematic, if not interpreted correctly. Expert opinion When asked on this topic, Stane Merše an expert from the Jožef Stefan Institute, Energy Efficiency Centre stated: “I think the statement is true, because it cites one of the key studies of IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2020. The article correctly summarizes the main source, on which the claim is based.” However, he warns that with all such short messages, it does not really provide a broader explanation and justification, so it needs to be interpreted correctly. On the one side, due to rapid technological development and a stimulating financial environment, large solar power plants are actually the cheapest new source of electricity globally at the moment, compared to other new large power plants. On the other side however, it is also necessary to be aware of all the limitations of this source, as it is limited in time and unstable, so it can only be used in cooperation with other sources.   Source: Screenshot of Carbon Brief https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea  Merše continues that IEA results confirm that solar energy being the cheapest is already a dominant global fact (the results confirm this for the world’s largest markets – USA, EU, China and India), but the economics of solar power plants depend mainly on (1) latitude – the closer to the equator, the longer the duration of solar radiation and the lower the costs, and (2) the regulatory framework of countries regarding solar power plants – integration into the grid and electricity market and other incentives are essential. Our expert explains that, systemically, the method, used by IEA to count the costs of installations of large power plants, does not take into account other costs and impacts caused by technologies in the electricity system, which are certainly higher in solar energy due to instability and time-limited production than in other more predictable technologies. As well as the above mentioned geographical differences and regulatory frameworks implemented but different governments. These additional costs must be taken into account when the future electricity supply is planned systematically. Therefore, each resource has its (limited) role in the system and only with their coherent and optimal integration, lowest cost supply can be achieved.  Solar energy will play an increasing role, but it will necessarily have to be complemented by other low-carbon sources, but the conclusion, that we can provide all the electricity in the future with solar energy would certainly be wrong and problematic concludes Merše and sums up: “The future will certainly be much brighter than today, and in addition to the new capacities of solar power plants, the harmonious development of electricity networks will be crucial.” Conclusion In short it can be said that the statement by Greenpeace Slovenia on Twitter that solar energy is from now the cheapest source of electric energy, turned out to be mostly true, but various contextual factors need to be taken into account. Therefore, it is recommended to not always trust in appealing titles, but also to read the full article, make additional research. Often short titles are not able to disclose the full true, as context is a relevant factor and cannot be introduced in 280 or less symbols.

67,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-at-least-30-times-more-plastic-on-the-bottom-of-the-ocean-than-on-the-surface/,“At least 30 times more plastic on the bottom of the ocean than on the surface“,2020-12-03,eufactcheck,,"The Belgian news service “De Morgen” claimed that there’s at least 30 times more plastic on the bottom of the ocean than on the surface. The news service is referring to a study that took place at the Australian coast. Research if the claim can be applied to our European sea waters however, found proof that the claim is true.  Headline in De Morgen: “At least 30 times more plastic on the bottom of the ocean than on the surface”  Microplastics in the ocean Microplastics are fragments of plastic that are smaller than 5mm according to the University of Southampton. There are two types of microplastics. The first type of plastics are plastic fragments or particles that are already 5 mm in size or less before entering the environment or specifically the ocean. These are for example, microfibers from clothing, microbeads, and plastic pellets. This type also includes the plastics that float on the ocean surface and eventually break down into smaller pieces. The other type of microplastics originate from the degradation of larger plastic products. These are for example, fragments of plastic bottles, fishing nets and plastic bags. That degradation often happens before entering the ocean and is often caused by sunlight, oxygen, and wave action. Because of the fact that microplastics are very small in size, they can easily spread and sink to the bottom of the ocean. That also makes it hard to get them out of the ocean again, it is far more difficult than removing macroplastics that are floating on the surface. How does EU conquer the plastic pollution problem? Ursula von der Leyen stated in a video: “I want Europe to become the first climate neutral continent in the world by 2050.” The European Commission introduced the European Green Deal. It puts a zero pollution ambition on the agenda and the European Parliament decided on a single-use plastic ban by 2021. According to Eurostat, an average of 41,7% of the plastic packaging waste has been recycled in the EU in 2017. The plastic that already floats in the ocean can so far not be removed. Dr. Mark Lenz (GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany) researched microplastic in the ocean and its influence on marine organisms. „The ocean can be clean again but it has to clean itself. The plastic will sink to the bottom of the ocean, will sediment into the ground and become a part of the lithosphere (the rigid, outermost shell of the Earth), so it’s no part of the biosphere anymore. This sediment layer can later be identified as the plasticera.” Dr. Lenz also stated that the influences of microplastic can not be estimated yet since it is not known what long term consequences are to expect. Most marine animals suffer suffocation or starvation by bigger plastic parts since they confuse it for food sources. 8.4 million tonnes of microplastic in global deep sea According to a study of frontiers in Marine science the microplastics have been found in deep-sea sediments in surveyed areas of all major oceans. The Study quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight, using different techniques. The analyzed sediment cores from six locations showed that the mean microplastic recovery of positive controls was 71 percent. It also showed, if scaling up the empirical data of the study to the global approximation, there could be as much as 14.4 million tonnes of microplastic in the top 9 cm of sediment throughout the world’s ocean. Based on the microplastic count of global deep-sea sediment studies (0.72 MP g–1 dry sediment), they estimate a mass of 8.4 million tonnes of microplastic. This global mass calculated suggests that the bottom of the ocean has between 34 and 57 times the standing stock of plastic at the surface. Illustration by Annika Reinker Dr. Colin Janssen (University of Ghent, Laboratory for Environmental Toxicology and Aquatic Ecology) confirms the findings mentioned before. “This finding is not new. All over the world we can see that most of the plastics in the oceans eventually end up on the seabed, also in the deep sea.” His research ‘Assessment of marine debris on the Belgian Continental Shelf’ shows that only 1% remains at the sea surface while 94% of plastics are found at the bottom. Which means the results of his Assessment are roughly comparable to the 30x observed by the Australian researchers and are certainly applicable in Europe and the rest of the world. Dr. Janssen: “About 10 years ago, my lab also investigated how many micro and macroplastics were present off the Belgian coast. For the large plastic (> 1mm) we found: up to 4kg / km2  for the sea surface, up to 1.3 kg / km2 for the bottom. For the beach – which is also a bottom: up to 53 kg / km2 of beach. However, for the small microplastics we found: 2 kg / km2 for the sea surface and for the bottom up to 166 kg / km2. So you can see that if we combine large and small plastic, we also easily get a factor of 30 and more. Conclusion In short, we can conclude that the claim of ‘De Morgen’ is true. There is at least 30 times more plastic on the bottom of the ocean than on the surface. Every single one of the experts we talked to agrees. The only thing we are not sure about is the impact this will have on our planet. The long term consequences of all this plastic on the bottom of the ocean are not yet known.

68,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-after-brexit-referendum-brits-move-to-an-eu-country/,After Brexit Referendum Brits move to an EU country,2020-11-30,eufactcheck,,"The German News Show “Tagesschau“ claimed that after Brexit Referendum Brits move to an EU country. Although our research proved the fact true, we decided to classify the claim as mostly true because there are several Brits who left the UK before Brexit or had other reasons to leave the country. Due to the upcoming final Brexit on the first day of 2021, the German news broadcast “Tagesschau“ published a report in which they said that “After Brexit Referendum Brits move to an EU country“. The report also suggests the reasons for leaving the United Kingdom that are mostly justified by Brexit and its consequences for the citizenship of Great Britain. The appropriate translation of the headline, published in the german news broadcast “Tagesschau“: “after Brexit Brits emigrate to Europe”. In the further course it becomes clear that it is a matter of migration movements in connection with the Brexit referendum. The History and Impact of Brexit Four years passed by since the Brexit referendum on June 23rd 2016. 52 percent of the British population voted for an exit out of the European Union. A lot of negotiations have happened between the EU and Great Britain over the years and on february 1st 2020 the euro exit was completed. The Brexit transition is on january 1st 2021. Even though there are still economic negotiations going on between the United Kingdom and the European Union, it seems like the UK is leaving the EU without a trade agreement. The “hard Brexit” would become reality. In that case the UK has to reassemble itself economically. It’s unclear how the countries will deal with these economical losses in the future which could lead to existential fear in the British population. The number of emigrants increases In order to make a statement about the influences of the Brexit referendum on the UK migration, we have to take a look at the migration statistics, published by the office for national statistics. Regarding the quarterly report from august 2020, figure 1 shows a slight increase of the emigration rate since the referendum in June 2016.Referring to figure 1, it shows the emigration behaviour of all the citizens in the UK but it is  important to distinguish between a British citizenship and a non British citizenship.  This diagram shows a difference between all citizens living in the UK and only British citizens. While the line of all civilians tends to increase since the Brexit referendum 2016, the emigration rate of the British remains stable.  This diagram shows a difference between all citizens living in the UK and only British citizens. While the line of all civilians tends to increase since the Brexit referendum 2016, the emigration rate of the British remains stable. But why is that? Since 2016 “the largest change in the number of people leaving the UK was from EU citizens, increasing by 29 percent to 123,000” according to the Office for National Statistics. To understand the impact of the Brexit transition on the British population, it is more important to look at the shifting of citizenship. Even though there isn’t an increase of the emigration rate noticeable, more British citizens decided to change their citizenship. According to the statistical office of the European Union the number of the loss of citizenships by sex and new citizenship increased since the referendum in 2016. This is also shown in the naturalisation statistic in Germany. The application rate of UK civilians increased from 600 applications in 2015 to 2,900 applications in 2016 again to 7,500 in 2017 up to 14,900 in 2019. Referring to the Office for National Statistics, the Brexit referendum isn’t the only reason for people to leave the UK. Taking a look at graphic 1, it is also important to mention the rapid increase in 2008. According to the results of the Office for National Statistics, the main reason for people leaving the UK for a year or more during the time of the financial crisis is because of work, either because of a “definite job” or because of “looking for work”. The rate of all citizens leaving went over 400,000 and never got even close to that number again in the years after until today. What other reasons exist for people to abandon the United Kingdom? Reasons for leaving When talking about reasons for people to leave the UK, it is important to take a look at the International Passenger Survey (IPS) estimates. The IPS asks people leaving the UK for a year or more what is their main reason for emigrating, and their responses are categorised by their main intended activity when abroad such as ‘work related’ or ‘study’. We contacted Dr. Rhiannon Brook, the research officer at the Centre for International Migration, who took part in the IPS estimates and provided us with this information. According to those studies, the main reason for British citizens to leave the UK for a year or more is “work related”. Either because of a “definite job” or because of “looking for work”. Since 2016, after a slight increase between June and December, the numbers of people leaving because of work decreased until 2018. From 2018 onwards, there is an increase observable. The second reason for people leaving are “other” reasons. The number of those increased since 2016 up to almost 30 thousand in 2018 but increased steadily since then.The Reasons “formal study” and “going home to live” remained stable over the years since 2010 and never reached the number over 10 thousand.“No reason stated” slightly increased from 2010 until June 2016, since then it mostly remained stable between the numbers of 10 to 20 thousand.The last reason possible to choose according to IPS is “accompany/join” someone in another country. Since 2010 it decreased from about 25 thousand to about 8 thousand in the end of 2018, after that it mostly remained stable. According to Dr. Rhiannon Brook, from this they “cannot say whether Brexit is the reason for an individual leaving the UK”. These numbers only include people with a British citizenship.Looking at the WZB Study (Berlin social science Center), a quantitative survey about UK citizens living in Germany, it shows “that uncertainty about the political, economic, or social state of a home country can trigger migratory behaviour” (Auer 2020 p.6). It says that the uncertainty created by the Brexit referendum had a bigger influence on migration decision making than the uncertainty that comes with migration itself.Yet there are no specific numbers about people leaving the UK, who state “Brexit” as a reason. According IPS, the main reason for British citizens to leave the UK for a year or more is “work related”.  Importance of Covid-19 Because the Covid-19 pandemic is so current, there isn’t a lot of information published to talk about the impact of the coronavirus on the migration in Great Britain. According to a survey about the coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain from 11 to 15 november, published by the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (COVID-19 module), the  coronavirus does have an impact on the future plans of the UK population. Out of 1.2 million citizens who are considering living outside the UK in the next 12 months, fifteen percent state that because of “worries about the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. That contains over 180 thousand people. Difficulties in elucidating the claim In the beginning of the research, the amount of current and useful statistics about emigration in the UK was not enough to work with. Also, it was difficult to separate the claim, which was the headline of the report , from the rest of the report. The first sentence of the intro of the report starts with “Zuerst verlässt Großbritannien Europa” (English: “First, Great Britain leaves Europe”) which is in fact false and also confusing because Great Britain can not leave the continent. The lack of statistics about emigration in the UK was not a problem later, though it was not possible to consult facts and figures about the influence of Brexit on the emigration decisions. In other words, the turning point Brexit in 2016 was not a good time to concentrate on due to a small amount of statistics or figures. Therefore, interpretations were difficult to make in our early stages of fact checking. That also affected our conclusion. Conclusion Basically the claim from the “Tagesschau” is considered as true because there are surely more emigration flows from the UK to other EU countries like Germany. It is important to mention that a lot of those people were citizens with a European citizenship that decided to return home. Even though there is no increase of the emigration behaviour of people with a British citizenship noticeable, it’s safe to say that the applications for naturalisation of British citizens in European countries increased rapidly since 2016.It is also occupied that many British citizens are not sure whether their country will offer them a place to live and to work although Great Britain is no longer a member of the European Union. In short, we can notice an increase of the emigration rate in the UK. However we can´t clearly say that emigration is completely forced by Brexit. Therefore the statement is mostly true.

This claims turns out to be mostly true. Knack used the figures from the EMCDDA, the agency of the European Union that monitors drug traffic. Their reports are openly available on the internet.

Increasing amounts The drug figures in the EMCDDA reports were misleading because it showed the opposite of the claim. There were less intercepted seizures, so why would Knack say that the increase in the EU was due to an increase in the Port of Antwerp? It seemed like the claim was already busted. Nevertheless, more research was needed to investigate this claim. Source: ECMDDA More important figures are the ones that clarify the evolution in the amount of intercepted heroin. The research clearly showed that the number of intercepted kilos had increased enormously. In 1 year time, the amount had almost increased by one hundred times. An increase that is quite remarkable when you see that the number of interceptions has decreased anyway. In the graph, there is a clear increase that could not be explained by the figures in the report. Source: ECMDDA Two experts provide their expertise and explanation on this claim and ensure that there is a logical end point to complete this claim. Experts Kathryn Robinson, Head of Sector, Media Relations and Marketing and Communication Unit at ECMDDA  points out the importance of context.“It is not unusual to see total quantities seized suddenly increase due to a few large seizures , as occured in Antwerp. Belgium seized more than 4,5 tonnes of heroïn, compared with only 53 kilos in the previous year. This was the main reason for such an important increase in the quantity of heroïn seized in the EU. The quantity of heroïn seized in other countries fluctuated within the normal decade ranges.“  “So yes, the statement is correct. But without context, the claim is misleading. If you would only look at the amount of seizures, you would not be able to tell that the claim is true. By looking at the intercepted quantity in kg’s , things get a lot more clear.”  A couple of seizures with amounts above 100 kilograms made sure that Belgium is the main reason why there is such an increase in the EU. There is even 1 interception of 870 kilograms of heroin, which is one of the largest shipments ever. Else De Donder, staff member study & research at VAD (the Flemish expertise center for alcohol, illegal drugs, psychoactive medication, gambling and gaming) compares the Belgian and the Spanish context. In Spain, the number of seizures is much higher than in Belgium (almost 10 times more). However, the amount intercepted is always lower than in Belgium, which means that there are (some) larger catches in Belgium. The statement in the press points to the intercepted quantity which is indeed higher in Belgium and due to some extremely large catches in the port of Antwerp. I understand that there is confusion when one reads the statement and puts it next to the numbers. Therefore it is important that there is always a clear explanation when talking about this type of content. Conclusion The figures in Belgium are going steadily. Every year more and more drugs are intercepted in the EU, and the port of Antwerp is clearly the main player. In short, if you look at the figures, it is clear that the claim is true. Although the wording could certainly be a bit clearer. One should take into account the amount of kilos in the article when talking about an increase. Otherwise it’s not immediately clear to the reader what kind of increase it’s really about.

The news portal says that since October 19 a curfew starts from midnight to 5 am for a month period, Christmas markets will be canceled, cafes and restaurants will be closed. Russian media writes that due to the situation with the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announced a curfew in the country. Also at a press conference following government emergency meeting, was announced that Christmas markets will be canceled, and cafes and restaurants will be closed for a month. In order to check whether the information is true or not, we opened the official website of  Belgian government, then we found the “LATEST NEWS” section on the main page. One of the published news says that the COVID-19 level 4 alert is coming into effect in the country since October 19: indeed the Advisory Committee has decided a number of restrictive measures, including curfew and the closure of Christmas markets. However, the government’s website states that from midnight to 5:00 am, access to public places is prohibited except for important trips that cannot be postponed, such as for medical emergencies, business trips and trips to work.  Also the site says that cafes and restaurants are closed, with the exception for hotels guests who stay in them, and gatherings after funerals for a maximum of 40 people. Thus, we can conclude that the news presented by Russian Internet portal is mostly true, but omits some important details. Curfew has been imposed and restaurants are being closed, but there are some exceptions such as job and emergency travel and funerals.

71,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-german-newspaper-claims-people-are-hoarding-cash-in-the-crisis/,German newspaper claims “people are hoarding cash” in the crisis,2020-11-02,eufactcheck,,"Referring to the European Central Bank (ECB) the german „Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung“ (FAZ) headlined on September 24th, 2020: “In the crisis, people are hoarding cash.“ Even if the term “hoarding” is incorrect in this case, all other figures, facts, quotations and the context are correct, which is why the claim is to be assessed as “mostly true.” The claim refers to the fact that the rising money supply also increases the fear of inflation among some people. The term “money supply” includes cash, money in current accounts and money-similar securities and investments. The money supply is once again divided into three sub-levels. The money supply M3 is the broadest available money supply and includes all available money including debts and securities. The medium money supply M2 is smaller and contains only deposits with a maturity of up to two years (term deposits) and deposits with an agreed notice period of up to three months (savings deposits). The narrowest amount of money is the amount of money M1, which only includes cash and savings with immediate access, for example in current accounts. Referring to the EZB economic report the german newspaper FAZ tries to explain, why people are spending less money as usual during corona crisis. Higher money supply and cash circulation In his article the author writes – which the ECB confirms in their Economic Report of September, 24th 2020 – that the M3 increased by 9.2 percent in June 2020 and by 10.2 percent in July, and that the main reason is a sharp increase in cash and sight deposits in current accounts. In addition, according to the ECB, cash in circulation increased in July at a monthly rate of 9.8 percent. Moreover, the annual growth rate of the most liquid monetary aggregate, M1, which comprises overnight deposits and currency in circulation, rose to 13.5  percent in July, after 12.6  percent in June, and thus strongly contributed to M3 growth. The chart below shows the increase of the money supply M1 and M3 in the middle of 2020. The reasons for the increase are numerous. In this context, the economic journalist correctly quotes that the increase in money supply on current accounts is mainly due to the deposits of companies.  We contacted Dietmar Köster. Since 2014, he has been Managing Director of the  manufacturer Oerlikon Friction Systems and an expert in the field of finance and economics. “In crises, it is normal for companies to collect money in their accounts in order to remain liquid in case of doubt”, says the economist. With regard to the increase in cash, he also confirms: “This is also normal. People save cash, either because of insecurity or involuntarily due to a lack of spending opportunities. As a result, the ECB and the expert can confirm that both, money supply and cash circulation, have increased. The ECB report shows  the increase of the money supply M1 and M3 in the middle of 2020.   As an example of the high saving ratio during the crisis, FAZ cites the figures for Germany from the German Central Bank (DZB). The information provided by Stefan Bielmeier, Head of Research and Chief Economist of DZ BANK AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank, is consistent with the figures in the FAZ report. For example, the savings ratio in Germany in the second quarter was around 20.1 percent and therefore significantly higher than in the previous year. In addition, the DZB expects a saving ratio of 16 percent for the whole year, after 10. 9 percent in the previous year. All other figures in the text also match those in the reports of the DZB. The ECB also confirms the increased saving ratio for the European area. Therefore, the savings ratio in the first quarter of 2020 was historically high at just over 17 percent. With regard to the claim, these figures show that people are saving money during the crisis. However, the term “hoarding” is problematic. Involuntary savings because of Covid-19 First of all, we have to look at the reasons for saving money, which the auther also looks at in the last third of his text. Again, he refers to the calculations of the ECB’s experts. According to the ECB report, the increased savings ratio was on the one hand due to the most recent rise in expected unemployment, and because of that precautionary savings made a significant contribution to the higher savings ratio in the second quarter, on the other hand, the involuntary savings of private households due to the lack of opportunities for spending, for example through travel bans or the partial closure of recreational facilities and restaurants. Here, the article correctly quotes the ECB’s report, which states: “Unintentional saving seems to be the most important factor in the recent increase in household savings. In the model shown below, the proportionality between precautionary savings and the remaining size, the involuntary savings, can be clearly seen. The model out of the ECB report shows  the proportionality between precautionary savings and involuntary savings. Since the main reason for saving happens involuntary, the term “hoarding” in the claim has to be discussed critically. According to the dictionary, the definition for the german translation of hoarding, „horten“, is: “Collecting something because of its scarcity/preciousness”. This definition refers to the conscious action of people who, for example, collect items. Nathalie Schneider, a graduate of the masters program in German Studies at the University of Würzburg and currently teacher of German and geography at the Realschule Kitzingen, confirms this on request: “It is a synonym for gathering at a time of scarcity and therefore should definitely be defined as a knowing action.”  In this case, however, people do not save knowingly, but mostly involuntarily, as the newspaper states in the article. The author has nevertheless decided to use the term hoarding in the claim, although this is not correct in this context. This may lead to misunderstandings of the claim. Conclusion In summary, the FAZ-claim “In the crisis, people are hoarding cash” generally matches the facts. People are saving, respectively collecting more cash, which can be proven with the correctly quoted figures of the ECB’s economic report. The only problem is the misleading word “hoarding”, which claims, the people would save up their money by choice. In reality people save money involuntarily. Considering that the core of the statement as well as the facts in the accompanying report are correct in all areas, the claim can be assessed as “mostly true”.

72,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-the-reason-the-usa-show-so-many-cases-is-that-they-test-more/,“The reason the USA show so many cases is that they test more”,2020-08-25,eufactcheck,,"Donald Trump’s Twitter posting on 9 July 2020 establishes a correlation between the corona tests performed in a country and the confirmed Covid-19 cases in that country. Explicitly, he claims for the USA: “For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases,  compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!” Even though the correlation exists, Trump’s claim is mostly false. According to Donald Trump’s logic, countries that perform as many or more tests than the USA also have more people officially suffering from Covid-19. A first look at the data situation reveals that this is not the case in China because China is the country with the most tests performed worldwide: with over 90,000,000 tests performed, twice as many as the USA. But China with 86,322 cases confirmed has significantly fewer cases than the USA that have counted 3,499,394 so far. This already makes it clear that Trump’s statement cannot be true. Brazil is also a counterexample to Trump’s claim. With 1,900,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, Brazil has more than half as many cases as the USA. According to Trump, this would imply that Brazil has at least half of the number of tests performed in the USA, too. However, with 4,911,000 performed tests, Brazil carries out just 10.9% of the number of tests carried out in the USA.     Furthermore, one must consider the so-called “positive rate” in order to assess Trump’s claim. The positive rate describes the proportion of tests in a country that confirm a Covid-19 case by yielding a positive test result. If one followed the logic by Trump, it should mean that the positive rate of all countries is equal. However, a look at the data shows that the positive rates of the countries vary considerably. Countries with high test volumes show lower positive rates (e.g. Australia: 0.5%) than countries with low test volumes (e.g. Brazil: 38.7%). This means that countries that carry out many tests also tend to collect significantly more negative tests than countries that carry out fewer tests. Therefore, the statement of the Twitter post can be clearly refuted with respect to positive rates. Finally, at closer inspection, Trump’s statement may also allude to a possible dark figure. By this, he could mean that the number of unreported cases is higher in countries that carry out few tests than in countries with a high volume of tests. The dark figure indicates how many people have contracted Covid-19 but are not included in the official case numbers. For example, people with unnoticeable symptoms may not be statistically recorded because they do not meet the criteria for conducting a test. It is therefore essential to differentiate between the cases reported and those actually infected. In order to definitely falsify the thesis of Donald Trump, however, a data set that shows the number of unreported cases worldwide would be necessary. Findings on the exact number of unreported cases can be obtained locally in studies (for example in the Heinsberg study in Germany), but it is simply not feasible to obtain global findings on this matter because factors like population density or public mobility vary considerably and affect the spread of Covid-19. In conclusion, it can be stated that Trump’s statement is clearly refuted on several points and is therefore largely incorrect. However, there is a correlation between the number of tests performed and the number of cases detected because a lot of Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and therefore only detected with a lot of testing. For these reasons the Twitter post is to be assigned to the category “mostly false”.

73,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-twice-as-many-men-die-from-coronavirus-than-women/,“Twice as many men die from coronavirus than women”,2020-07-21,eufactcheck,,"In a headline on April 5, 2020, the Copenhagen Post, an English-language publication in Denmark, wrote that “Twice as many men dead from coronavirus as women.” In the article itself, the publication sources the claim from a report released by Statens Serum Institut, an official institution operated under the Danish Ministry of Health that aims to ensure preparedness against infectious diseases. Yet, after thoroughly perusing the organization’s research reports on its official website, it is evident that there is no mention of this study at all. It seems this report doesn’t even exist. The Post didn’t provide any further context or sources, nor did they offer any further evidence to substantiate the data. The article was merely a bold claim with no further explanation. So, if this official report doesn’t exist at all, then is this claim entirely baseless?  A worldwide trend It turns out, the claim is not entirely unfounded. And the Copenhagen Post was not the only news outlet reporting on this aspect of the virus. On the other side of the Atlantic, the New York Times reported a similar phenomenon from New York City. As data from the city’s health department data showed, using the most recent figures from April 20, the Covid-19 death rate per 1000,000 people was 1,736.43 men and just 80.06 women. There’s a similar trend in Europe too. Global Health 50/50, an independent initiative working to advance action for gender equality in global health has collaborated with CNN to collect data from countries that are recording Covid-19 deaths by sex. The figures are continuously being compiled from various ministries of health or health officials, or requested from press offices of different national ministries. Their Covid-19 sex-disaggregated data tracker is then updated based on the most recent numbers, usually every Wednesday. Their most recent update from April 22 showed that 60 per cent of deaths in Spain were male. This figure was 65 per cent in Italy. In Denmark, the tracker most recently showed that 59 per cent of the 370 reported deaths were male. And while the official Statens Serum Institut report that the Copenhagen Post referred to is not available on the institution’s official English website, their Covid-19 monitoring report was actually available on Global Health 50/50’s website. Overall, according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) European regional office—that publishes weekly surveillance reports, the most recently published being from the week of April 13 to 19—63 per cent of all reported deaths in Europe were male.  Source: Regional Office for Europe, World Health Organization  But why? This trend is consistent throughout the countries that have recorded the number of Covid-19-related deaths by sex. Some have suggested that behavioural differences among men and women may be a factor—for example, men are more likely to smoke, a 2015 analysis from the National Center for Biotechnology Information showed, potentially causing a higher number of underlying lung conditions. But it may also come down to biological differences. “Women live longer than men, and they tend to develop hypertension and heart disease — both of which increase the risk of severe disease with Covid-19 — at later ages than men,” Kathryn Sandberg, the director of the Center for the Study of Sex differences in Heath, told the New York Times. “The X chromosome — women have two, of course, and men only one — and the female hormone estrogen are believed to play a role in immunity.” Sandberg also said that women tend to have more robust immune systems than men, which may increase their capacity to weather the virus.   Conclusion  The Copenhagen Post’s headline claiming that twice as many men have died from Covid-19 bears some element of truth. Yet claiming that “twice as many men” is misleading—and an overgeneralization of the figures. While the ratio in Denmark is nearly two to one, the Post’s precise statement is inaccurate without context, because they don’t specify that they’re only referring to Danish figures in their claim. Many other countries do show such a big difference. It is true, however, that men are more likely to be more severely affected by Covid-19 than women. But it’s also difficult to trust the exact figures. Data can differ based on the extent of testing, which varies from country to country, and how many deaths are reported. Yet overall, in evaluating the available data from countries that have been recording deaths by sex, there is a consistent trend that men tend to be more harshly affected by the disease and represent a larger number of deaths. *Due to the small number of cases among transgender and gender-nonconforming people, data on those cases were not included on statistics sites.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Sydney Bartos   Disclaimer: recent data can be found on: GlobalHealth5050 and show the same patterns as reported on by media worldwide, in April 2020     Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

74,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-theres-basically-a-whole-tier-missing-from-the-uk-welfare-state/,“There’s basically a whole tier missing from the UK welfare state.”,2020-07-21,eufactcheck,,"On March 26th, Jon Stone, a policy correspondent at The Independent UK wrote a series of tweets in which he claimed that select normal EU unemployment benefits are similar to what the UK is doing for those who cannot work due to the COVID-19 crisis. “One thing I think many British people may not understand is that the ‘government will cover 80% of your salary if you can’t work because of the coronavirus’ scheme is actually very similar to how regular unemployment benefit works in a lot of Europe”. Stone went on to claim: “These are funded by contributions, and usually after you exhaust this initial unemployment benefit you fall back to a lower tier that is more akin to Britain’s JSA system. But there’s basically a whole tier missing from the UK welfare state.” Jon Stones statements about the UK unemployment system in the Covid-19 crisis prove to be true.    Unemployment in the UK Jon Stone’hes first tweet, in which he states that the UK government will cover 80% of one’s salary if they are not able to work because of the coronavirus can easily be checked on the UK government website. It states that an employer can claim for their employee’s wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This is to claim to cover wages for employees on temporary leave due to COVID-19. It is stated on the government site that any entity with a UK payroll can apply, including businesses, charities, recruitment agencies and public authorities. If the maintenance of a workplace is affected by COVID-19 then employers are able to put their employees on furlough, a temporary leave, and apply for the grant offered by the government, which covers 80% of their usual monthly wage costs, up to £2,500 a month. This temporary scheme was initially put in place beginning March 1, 2020 and will continue until the end of October. Technically, furlough is not considered unemployment, as it is a temporary position. The UK government website shows that Jon Stone’s tweet is mostly true. However, there is a limited amount of £2,500 per month.   Unemployment in Europe The European Commission website gives information on the unemployment policies in other European countries, which Stone mentions in his series of tweets. According to the European Commission website, under the Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion section, an unemployed person in the Netherlands can be entitled to unemployment benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act. This comes with a number of conditions; insurance against unemployment, having lost at least 5 work hours a week, being available to work on the Dutch labour market, working to find another job, becoming unemployed through no fault of own, and having worked at least 26 weeks in the 36 weeks before you became unemployed. One who meets these conditions in the Netherlands is entitled to 75% of their last pay per day (up to a maximum of €214.28 during the first two months and 70% of the last pay earned thereafter). In Germany, one can apply for unemployment benefits if they have no job, work less than 15 hours per week, are available for work, and are actively seeking to end their unemployment. They must also have been paying contributions for at twelve months of the two years before becoming unemployed, as the contribution rate for unemployed insurance in 2.5% of one’s earned income. To receive unemployment benefits in Germany, one must inform the labour office of their unemployment and apply for the benefit. An unemployed person with children will receive 67% of the net wage they received on average per day during the 12 months before becoming unemployed, whereas someone without children will receive 60%. Although this is less than the 80% of usual monthly wage the UK is covering due to unemployment as a result of the global pandemic, these German benefits are still better than the benefits the UK provides on a normal basis. Based on information provided by the European Commission, France offers a “back-to-work allowance” (allocation d’aide au retour a l’emploi, ARE) paid by unemployment insurance to employees. Similar to the Netherlands and Germany, there are a conditions that one must meet to qualify for these benefits; show proof of termination, be capable of working, be enrolled as a job seeker, have worked at least 88 days, or 610 hours over the past 28 months, or 36 months for those over the age 53 years old, have no reached the legal retirement age, and are willing to accept reasonable job offers. Someone who meets these conditions in France is entitled to nothing less than 57% and not higher than 75% of the daily reference wage. The duration of payment of the allowance to the job seeker depends on the factor of age, as one who is under 53 years old will receive the benefits for 28 months preceding the end of their contract, and one over the age of 53 will receive allowance for 36 months.   Jobseekers Allowance  The UK Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) system works in three different types; ‘new style’ JSA, contribution-based JSA, and income-based JSA. Which type one can get depends on their circumstances. All of these types of JSA come with the conditions that one is available to work, not be in full-time education, and not be working or be working on average less than 16 hours per week. According to the UK government website, under the Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) section, the maximum amounts unemployed people can get is listed, but how much an individual is entitled to depends on factors such as age, income and savings. People from 18-24 years old can receive up to £58.90 per week. Those who are 25 years old or older are eligible for a maximum of £74.35 per week and couples (both over the age of 18) can receive up to £116.80 per week. Payments are usually made every two weeks.   Conclusion Jon Stone’s claim that there is a tier missing from the UK welfare state is true, as the UK does not offer similar unemployment benefits in normal circumstances, aside from what they are offering for furloughed employees during the COVID-19 crisis. Their regular unemployment benefits provide far less than the Netherlands, Germany and France, failing to provide unemployment benefits related to previous salaries.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Serena Halani   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

She also claims that top-level management should include more women because diverse teams would perform better. Taking that into account, her statement can be rated “mostly true”.

However, studies on the cause of the VW-scandal, the impact of women on corporate responsibility and fraudulent corporate behaviour as well as on the performance of diverse teams support the economist’s arguments, suggesting that her hypothesis could be correct.  Economist Monika Schnitzer on faz.net  The VW-scandal and its causes The VW-scandal, also known as “diesel gate”, emerged in 2015 when it was revealed that the German car giant has cheated on federal emissions test through the installation of a so-called “defeat device” on at least eleven million of its vehicles. This way the company fooled regulators and hid emissions so that their cars would appear to meet the requirements.Despite the primary cause of the emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which appears to have been misfeasance and malfeasance on a corporate-wide scale, researchers believe that the composition of the board itself facilitated a problematic culture at Volkswagen. A group of researchers identified three major problems with the Volkswagen board from a corporate governance standpoint. Firstly, they mention the interest-conflicting nature argue of the dual-class stock held by the dominant shareholding Porsche and Piech families. Secondly, they bring up the presence of a government as a significant shareholder. And thirdly, the typically German “two-tier” board organization (corporate structure system that consists of two separate boards of directors that govern a corporation) around the principle of co-determination.The authors of the paper conclude that “the failure of oversight at VW can be explained in large part by problems arising from the composition and functioning of the company’s two-tier board”. They believe that the scandal is “a testament to the importance of board composition, theory, and structure in helping to build and maintain a corporate culture that promotes integrity”. According to the aforementioned research, the composition of the board played a major role in the scandal. This suggests that a different composition of the board might have prevented the scandal. To find out how women might have affected the likelihood of the scandal, a look at reports that evaluate the impact of gender composition on corporate social responsibility is needed.   Impact of women in corporate boards   The relationship between gender composition and corporate social responsibility was examined by a study published in the Journal of Business Ethics. The study comes to the same conclusion as several others do: The number of women on the board shows a positive relationship with the strength ratings for corporate social responsibility. Women would bring a number of strengths to the board like increased sensitivity to corporate social responsibility and participative decision-making-styles.Another paper from 2014 provides further evidence that gender-based differences in the governance of firms have important implications regarding corporate performance, the management of risk and the value of the firm. For that reason, the authors recommend that firms should intentionally seek women to serve on their boards.To evaluate women’s impact on fraudulent corporate behaviour, a group of researchers compared 128 firms with violations to a sample of 128 matched control groups. They found that violations are less likely when the board has more women, independent members, and financial experts. Other Studies have also demonstrated that women are more cautious and their business judgments are more ethical. Kaplan, Pany, Samuels, & Zhang found women more likely to report fraudulent financial reporting.     The link between diversity and performance   A BCG study suggests that increasing the diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and improved financial performance. The research concludes that companies with above-average diversity on their leadership teams report a greater payoff from innovation. Companies with above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percent higher compared to companies with below-average leadership diversity.McKinsey states in their report “Diversity Matters” that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. The study “Getting to Equal 2019” by Accenture confirms the importance of diversity. However, it says that while diversity remains a critical building block for innovation a culture of equality is essential to help maximize innovation: “While the impact of diversity factors alone on innovation mindset is significant, it is much higher when combined with a culture of equality. In the most-equal and diverse cultures, innovation mindset is 11 times greater than in the least-equal and diverse cultures. “     Conclusion   Even though Schnitzer’s statement that the VW-scandal wouldn’t have happened with women in the board can’t be rated either true or false for this specific case, studies suggest the positive impact of women on social corporate responsibility and ethic corporate behaviour. Recent research also supports the economist’s claim that diverse teams perform better as diversity corresponds with innovation and improved financial performance. Taking that into consideration, Monika Schnitzer’s claim can be rated “mostly true”.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Sonja Wind   Also read our previous factcheck on Dieselgate     Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Romania has been tried for failing to meet its obligations regarding air quality and for systematically exceeding the limit values for microparticles (PM10) in Bucharest.  Following the Court’s decision, the Minister of Environment, Water Resources and Forests, Costel Alexe, requested the City Hall of Bucharest to draw up an emergency plan to reduce pollution. According to him, these measures should have been expedited in order not to trigger a new infringement procedure by the European Commission, which could cost Romania a minimum amount of 1.6 million euros, with penalties ranging from 2,000 to 120,000 euros per day. The Minister also stated that the institution he leads had sent seven warnings to the City Hall of Bucharest, but none of them were followed by any measures to reduce pollution. We are checking if the City Hall of Bucharest took measures to reduce excessive pollution in the city during the state of emergency and if the seven warnings issued by the Ministry of the Environment, Water Resources and Forests are real. Context Commenting on the Court’s decision, which also includes four other Romanian cities, Costel Alexe stated that: “The case of Bucharest is by far the worst. The capital city already has a conviction by the European Court of Justice for exceeding PM10 values. We have officially asked the General City Hall to send us a short-term emergency plan as soon as possible, with measures capable of filing the Court’s verdict. So far, we have not received any answer, although any delay may cost Romania a new infringement procedure for PM10 values, this time with sanctions.” He also added that “During all this period, we sent no less than seven warnings to the General City Hall for these overruns and none was followed by any measure to reduce and eliminate PM10 pollution in Bucharest.”  Bucharest has an integrated air quality plan (PICA) for 2018-2022. The plan has a total of 20 measures, which can be found on pages 110-132. Within the measures, concrete projects were established with achievement indicators that ensure the fulfillment of the measures that were structured in various categories. Among the measures listed in this program, we can mention: modernization of transport infrastructure, renewal of the public transportation company’s car park, operation of new tram lines, construction of passages and bridges, underground lines, parking spaces, bike lanes, planting trees and vegetation and daily or annual green space maintenance. It would also provide for measures to improve public transport in the center of Bucharest, expand the green space, as well as street sanitation. On April 30, 2020, the General City Hall of Bucharest issued a press release on the Court’s decision. The mayor’s office informs that: “The period for which the Court of Justice of the European Union condemned Romania – for the pollution in Bucharest – was generated by the non-observance of the air quality conditions imposed by the European legislation in a period prior to the current mandate (seven years of non-compliance respectively 2007-2014, when the general mayors were Adriean Videanu and Sorin Oprescu).” The General Mayor, Gabriela Firea states: “The pollution in the Capital did not appear in 2016, it has been a topic ignored by all the authorities for over 20 years! Aware of the seriousness of this problem, we focused our efforts on implementing effective measures to reduce pollution in the Romanian capital. I want to emphasize that PICA does not only mean the City Hall but actually sums up the joint effort of all those responsible for urban traffic, increasing energy efficiency, eliminating pollution sources generated by construction activities, and improving the quality of green spaces in the Capital. This means both the local authorities and the Government, through the line ministries!” LAW no. 104, of June 15 2011 on ambient air quality, established several responsibilities for mayors in this field. According to the law, the mayor is the one in charge of fulfilling the air quality plan, but other authorities should also control and ensure the implementation of measures. General Mayor, Gabriela Firea, also explained that the measures provided in PICA cannot be denied, as their results can be seen daily in Bucharest: “For the first time in recent decades, we have allocated millions of euros for the modernization of public transport: new buses, Euro 6, we are buying hybrid buses, electric buses, and new trams!” On March 29, the General Mayor also blew the whistle on possible illegal black oil furnacing around Bucharest that could be one of the causes behind excessive air pollution. Conclusion: Costel Alexe’s statement is uncheckable. Apart from the press release of the City Hall related to the Court’s schedule, dated April 29, 2020, we were not able to find information about any measures taken by the institution during the state of emergency. Out of the seven warnings that Costel Alexe claimed were issued by the Ministry of the Environment, Water Resources and Forests, only three could be traced: the first was issued on March 18, the second on March 21 and the third one on March 24. Although they imply the activity of the Ministry, not all of them can be seen as official warnings sent to the General City Hall of Bucharest. Indeed, the City Hall did not come up with an emergency plan to reduce pollution. But this measure is not the sole responsibility of the aforementioned institution. There are other authorities that should monitor and ensure the implementation of the measures. The General City Hall of Bucharest is not the only one to blame in this situation. Regarding PICA, even if the City Hall of Bucharest managed to approve a four-year plan for improving air quality in the city, which was to be applicable, it was not able to implement most of its measures until now. Although the Minister of Environment asked the Bucharest City Hall for a short-term emergency plan for this period, it was not implemented. The General City Hall did not come up with concrete solutions to reduce pollution in the Capital in the short term. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

77,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-religious-and-political-leaders-claim-that-same-sex-marriage-is-the-reason-for-corona/,Religious and political leaders claim that same-sex marriage is the reason for corona,2020-06-22,eufactcheck,,"Worldwide many influential religious and political leaders are linking the coronavirus to the legislation of same-sex marriage. They claim that the outbreak of the pandemic is the punishment and reckoning of God. These statements are uncheckable by nature, but to show how widespread this kind of misinformation is, EUfactcheck gives an overview of the different statements, across religions.  Eastern Orthodox  The patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Filaret Denysenko, claimed that the legislation of same-sex marriage is the cause of coronavirus. He said the following in an interview with the Ukrainian national tv network Channel 4 published in March: “An epidemic is God’s punishment for the sins of man, the sinfulness of humanity.” The patriarch has a big influence on society, he has more than 15 million followers in Ukraine, a country with a population of 42 million. When he’s disseminating this type of misinformation, it could have a big impact on the thoughts of these 15 million people or even more. Especially because his statement was spread by the national tv channel. The Ukrainian organisation Insight LBGTQ has announced to sue Denysenko for his discriminating statements while many activists have condemned the Ukrainian preacher Patriarch Filaret’s comments as ‘dangerous’ as PinkNews reported. In Germany, the Russian Orthodox bishop of Berlin and Germany, Mark Arndt, identified the non-recognition of the “God-given difference between man and woman” as one of the reasons for the Corona crisis. He said it is no surprise that God punishes humans for these sins. There are also some statements that are similar to the ones described. They’re not directly concerning same-sex marriage, but accusing the LGBTQ scene and homosexuals as sinners and therefore as the reason of the spread of the virus. For his statement he was heavily criticized cross-party in Germany. “It is wrong to interpret the coronavirus as a divine visitation in reaction to a free society”, said Stefan Rupert, member of the Liberal Democratic Party in Germany. He told the newspaper TAZ: “This is suitable to frighten people and not part of a solution.” But not only he spoke against Arndt, as members of the German Green Party and the Social Democratic Party joined the criticism.    Screenshots from various media reporting on a presumed connection between coronavirus and same-sex marriage IslamThis is not restricted to Ukraine. In Iraq, the influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr described same-sex marriages as one of the reasons for the spread of the coronavirus. “I therefore call on all governments to repeal this law [to legalise marriage] immediately and without hesitation,” Al-Sadr demanded on Twitter. He said that would also enable them to repent for their guilt. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden according to Islamic faith. Iraq is inhabited by a majority of Shiites, but same-sex is not explicitly punishable. Nevertheless, Iraqi authorities use laws on prostitution and the maintenance of public order to punish LGBTQ people as hurriyet.de reported.Statements like those of Muqtada al-Sadr may reinforce these discriminatory views and lead to further humiliation and punishment of this group. The impact of his claims may even be bigger because he is an influential cleric. Nonetheless, he was heavily criticized for his tweet on social media. Aya Mansour, editor of Iraq Media Network, said for example that coronavirus is not as dangerous as his statements. Iraq activist and photographer Ali Dab Dab asked for his source as the Middle East Eye reported.  So, there was a lot of criticism, not only by LGBTQ organisations or activists.  ChristianityAcross the Atlantic in the United States we can find a lot of statements regarding same sex-marriages in evangelical circles. Chattanooga Times Free Press, Metro Weekly and Bild reported  that the conservative Evangelist Perry Stone said that he predicted the coronavirus. He claimed the pandemic is a “reckoning” of God for same-sex marriage. Stone is very popular and earns millions with tv shows and books and sees himself as a prophet. So, he has a big influence, which can be dangerous when spreading misinformation because he can shape perceptions of the people listening to him. He not only claims that the outbreak is God’s retribution for same-sex marriage, he also sees abortion as a reason for the pandemic. Stone has been criticized for statements like these for decades. Critics have called him a heretic and false prophet who is using faith to sell his products as the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported The influential media mogul, US television preacher and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson also considers same-sex marriage and abortion responsible for the corona pandemic. In his own personality show “The 700 Club” he blamed the marriage opening for gays and lesbians as well as abortion for the corona crisis. He also said a cure is only in sight if people stop sinning. Like the others he is an influential character in the United States. According to CBN about 650.000 households watch his show every day. Additionally, he is very close to president Donald Trump’s administration and regularly invites high-ranking White House officials as guests to his show. Thus, he and his statements can have a major influence on society and politics. Robertson is an anti-LGBTQ activist for decades and was criticized for his discriminating words. He is using catastrophic events like the corona outbreak as an excuse to spread the same agenda he always supported.  In Europe, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor John Carson also sees abortion and same-sex marriage as the reason for corona. In a Facebook post he claimed it was clear that the nation would be judged by God for the legalisation. After a social media storm he said his comment was “misinterpreted.” Even the DUP, his own party, has distanced itself from his discriminating comment. In addition, the LGBT advocacy group, the Rainbow Project, labelled his statement as “disgraceful but not surprising” and called for disciplinary action against him.  JudaismThe influential Orthodox Israeli Rabbi Meir Mazuz claimed that Covid-19 was the retribution for nations that allow LGBTQ pride parades. He said Pride is “a parade against nature, and when someone goes against nature, the one who created nature takes revenge on him.” In addition, he said that the Bible teaches homosexuals lose their souls and God destroys LGBT societies. As the others he is criticized for this discrimination.    Countering misinformation and hate speech The discrimination, stigmatization, hate speech and attacks on the LGBTQ community went so far that even the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pointed out in a newsletter the size of the impact of these statements. The newsletter announces that these people are especially vulnerable during the pandemic and face a greater risk. Therefore, they should be protected and not be discriminated even more. But as previously mentioned, homosexual people were attacked by several political and religious leaders and their alleged sins were declared as the cause of the coronavirus. And that happened across religion, across continents. Rabbis, pastors and imams blame homosexuality and same-sex marriage for the coronavirus pandemic.The fact that same-sex marriage is not even legal in China, Italy and Iran – countries that are badly affected by the coronavirus – makes these statements even less credible and -from a logical point of view- untrue, despite that we are dealing with uncheckable religious rhetoric.  Conclusion The statements regarding the connection between coronavirus and homosexuality or same sex marriage, cannot be disproved, as the advocates of this thesis refer to God. It is therefore a matter of faith and of religious rhetoric. The statements share the similar words like plague, sins, punishment and always refer to God or religious beliefs. Therefore, one can see the similarities between these statements, claiming that same-sex marriage or homosexuality is the cause of the virus.All claims are shared on social media and regular media are reporting about it as well. Hence, these claims can have a huge impact on society because they are spread and discussed in public. With this in mind, none of the cited examples or statements were linked in this EUfactcheck article.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Paula L.

This claim by Dutch politician, writer and former diplomat Petra Stienen who was elected in June 2015 as a member of the Senate of the Netherlands representing social-liberal party D66 is mostly true.  On May 2, 2020 the Dutch newspaper De Groene Amsterdammer published the sixth episode from the Necessary conversations: reflections on a new world (September 2020, Jurgen Mass editorial): Reflections in times of corona #6: Petra Stienen A divine voice in the silence. In this episode different topics were discussed such as: God, mental health and gender. The member of the Senate Petra Stienen presented several arguments supporting the differences in politics, economy and gender-violence between women and men during this pandemic. This fact check address three of them: “Not now”: women’s issues not considered,  Women on the front line, and Violence against women and increasing domestic violence. “Not now”: women’s issues not considered in times of corona  The first statement that Petra Stienen makes around gender inequalities is: “All the women I spoke to over the years always said one thing:“ If we emphasize that we want to be at the table and that our needs and interests need to be part of the decisions, because we have different views and a different economic and social position, that we are sitting at home with men so frustrated that they hit us – something we again see in times of Covid-19 – what do those in power say? “Not now.” Here, Petra Stienen says that the women’s issues are not taken into account in politics and by people in power. She continues with an example from real life: “In 2011, on International Women’s Day, on March 8, a group of women in Tahrir protested for more women’s rights in the new Egypt and they were scrutinized by their own colleagues on social media stating: “How dare you take the square for women’s issues, in these times of our glorious revolution? Not now” The Egyptian revolution of 2011, also known as the January 25 Revolution started on 25 January 2011 and spread across Egypt. The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with the annual Egyptian “Police holiday” as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last few years of Mubarak’s presidency. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, non-violent civil resistance, acts of civil disobedience and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country. Egyptian women have been participating actively in the revolution, in the same way that they played an active role in the strike movement in the few last years, in several cases pressurizing the men to join the strikes. However, they were treated in a different way than men. Many books and articles can confirm the repression against women in Tahrir: The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World (2017), The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today’s World (2013) and State Crime, Women and Gender. This last book quotes Johansson-Nogues (2013) on the consequences that followed the oppression: “Despite this active engagement and this feeling of gender unity, many women did suffer violent victimization during the protest and were denied participation in the transition period that followed the revolution” Moreover, Stienen talks about her experience with “not right now” in her life, and in this case, in times of coronavirus pandemic.  “And if you ask a question about it – and I will – I still sometimes get the response:” Not right now “,” says Stienen. “In that respect, I feel a connection with my friends in the Middle East.”  Women on the front line In the interview published in De Groene Amsterdamer Petra Stienen also comments that women are both on the front line as doctors, nurses or teachers and in many cases also have to be care givers at home. Looking at Statistics Netherlands-CBS’ studio released on November 13, 2019, it is stated that more women than men are working in occupations at higher professional or university level, in particular in the sector care and welfare education.  Moreover, in the academic year 2018/2019 748,000 students were enrolled in higher education study programme, as CBS explains. In veterinary medicine and care, welfare and health care programmes female students are in the majority. Source: Central Bureau of Statistics of The Netherlands.  In addition, in a Policy Brief: The Impact of Covis-2019 on Women published by United Nations on April 9, 2020, it shows that the capacity of women to absorb economic shocks is less than that of men because of the differences in the earnings, savings and jobs. This can be read on the fifth page of the policy brief:  Moreover, Petra Stienen states that only 25% of women work full-time, compared to 75 percent of men. Combined with lower paid jobs “It means that the income decline that everyone has (due to corona, ed.) affects most women harder.” Statistics Netherlands-CBS (More than half of Dutch people work full-time) show that in 2019 27% of women in the Netherlands worked full-time. The 25%, Stienen used, is from 2016. So full-time contracts for women are on the rise but it is still close to a quarter.   Violence against women and increasing domestic violence And last but not least, Petra Stienen speaks about gender violence and the increase during this crisis:  “Then there is the issue of fighting gender-based violence or the terror behind the front door, which is growing enormously in this crisis. And finally, the issue of women, peace and security that I find very interesting as a former diplomat.” Stienen is referring to information on the UN Women webpage.  In the featured publication Covid-19 and Ending Violence Against Women and Girls. it can be seen that the COVID-19 context has changed the gender-violence situation, making it worse. According to the text: “Emerging data shows that since the outbreak of COVID-19, reports of violence against women, and particularly domestic violence, have increased in several countries as security, health, and money worries create tensions and strains accentuated by the cramped and confined living conditions of lockdown.” Furthermore, on page 3 of the feature, it can be seen that in France, cases of domestic violence have increased by 30% since the lockdown on March 17th. Also in Cyprus, the helplines have registered and increase in calls by 30 per cent.  Conclusion In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence to support Stienen’s claim that this crisis affects women differently than men. Firstly, because they have different needs than men and these essentials are left aside by the people in charge. Secondly, women are in jobs with more exposure to the virus, they are more likely to be employed in the informal sector or small jobs, which makes their economic position more vulnerable. And, thirdly, violence against women during this crisis has increased. So, the statement “This crisis affects women differently than men” is mostly true.

This statement is mostly false, as the number seems to be higher. Monica Anisie`s claim, in an article published by Digi24, after the live interview Context Monica Anisie is currently the Minister of Education, member of the Orban Government, representing the National Liberal Party. This Government was voted by the Parliament on November 4, 2019, and dismissed three months later, by censure motion, but due to the emergency caused by the spread of the coronavirus, it was reinvested. Starting from March 11, 2020, the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research decided to suspend the courses in the pre-university system, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initially established period was of two weeks, but after some deadline extensions, the face-to-face courses were finally suspended for the rest of the semester, and the courses were to be held online. Furthermore, on April 22, the 12th article of the Order of the Minister of Education 4135 / 21.04.2020 made the attendance at these classes mandatory. Similar decisions have been made in most states worldwide, impacting over 60 percent of students, as the UNESCO Institute for Statistics study reveals. The Romanian educational situation during COVID-19 pandemic Even though 80% of Romanian households have internet access, almost half of the population lives in a rural area, and 15% of the citizens live in extreme poverty, according to official reports. Therefore, after switching to online courses, a problem arose: how many pupils can attend the classes and how many of them are actually deprived of education, due to the lack of technology? Monica Anisie`s claim, that 250,000 pupils do not have the infrastructure, is mostly false, because, based on the data available so far, the number is higher. Even though she said that hers is an approximation, the difference is significant. In April 2020, the Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy (IRES) managed to conduct a study entitled School during the state of emergency – students` access to online education in Romania, applied on a national representative sample, with a margin of error of + 2,5%. According to the analysis, one out of three pre-university students did not own, for instance, a webcam and a microphone.  There are approximately 2,8 million pre-university students registered in the 2019-2020 academic year, which would mean that 9% of them did not have access to technology, as specified by Monica Anisie. But according to the survey conducted by IRES, the number is three times higher, which means 840,000 students are in this situation (30% of the total). These students do not have access to a functional device (smartphone, PC, laptop, etc.)   Pupils` access to devices for online courses, according to IRES survey Moreover, 10% of pupils living in urban areas and 19% of pupils living in rural areas claim that the Internet connection in their home is not strong enough to support the online courses. Even though it is not applied on a representative sample, a survey conducted by UNICEF shows similar results: 71% of the respondents think that students’ access to devices for connecting to digital education is deficient and for 60% of them the Internet access is limited.  Both studies were already published when Monica Anisie made the statement. Moreover, in the same interview, the minister said that “tomorrow (May 5), at 9 AM, we will have a video conference and we will present these figures publicly”. According to the Ministry’s website, these numbers have not been released. At the same time, Anisie said  that she will ask the County School Inspectorates for solutions until June 12, 2020, which have not been released, nor mentioned, at the  moment this article was published.  Conclusion Taking into account all the data, the statement made by the Romanian Minister of Education and Research, Monica Anisie, that approximately 250,000 students do not have access to technology, is mostly false. She did not provide concrete data, but only an estimated number, which is the reason her claim cannot be considered entirely false. At the same time, according to the IRES representative survey, the number is significantly higher than what she initially stated.

He added that arrivals were only 1500 in the same period last year”.   It is well known that Malta has had a secret agreement with Libya for three years, based on which the Maltese armed forces track barges, travelling to the island, and asking Libyan coastguards to bring migrants back to North African detention centers. On the 4th of June, Italian newspaper Avvenire published a memorandum of understanding between the two countries that formalizes what has been happening. A second report by Avvenire and the British newspaper The Guardian  showed that a Maltese patrol boat hijacked to Sicily a dinghy, carrying 101 people. The dinghy  was already in Maltese territorial waters. Therefore, Matteo Salvini is telling the truth about Malta. According to reports from Reuters , since the 3rd of March 2020, Greece had already rebuffed about 35.000 migrants coming from both sea and land. Salvini’s claim about Greece is correct but it is difficult to prove the link between those events and the number of migrants who reached Italy. As a matter of fact, Greece received 9.935 immigrants from January 2020 to May 2020, and only 3.843  from the 20th of February, date of first declared infection by Covid-19 in Italy. About Greece we could also remember that last November, the Hellenic parliament voted in favor of a controversial bill, introducing sweeping changes to the national asylum system, including cutting some options for appeal and facilitating the deportation of failed asylum seekers.   When Matteo Salvini quotes the number of landings in Italy, he is accurate. As a matter of fact, according to Unhcr, from January 2020 to May 2020, 5119 people arrived by sea and in the same period last year they were 1561. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to clarify some points.  Salvini underlines that those 5119 landings occurred this year “despite the virus”. But we can notice that, from the 20th of February – when first Italian case of Covid-19 was declared – to the 31st of May, landings are 3054 in total. On the other hand, League’s leader uses the word sans-papiers referring to immigrants. It is incorrect because although they enter the country irregularly, they could not be called sans-papiers from the moment they submit the asylum application. Considering their countries of origin, a huge number of people arrived to Italy can be qualified as “asylum seeker”. Conclusion: Salvini’s claim is mostly true, although it is generic and incorrect in the way it connects facts, numbers and words.","https://www.la7.it/nonelarena/video/redistribuzione-immigrati-matteo-salvini-leuropa-ha-parlato-tanto-ma-ha-fatto-zero-31-05-2020-327927,https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/accordo-malta-libia-respingimento-migranti,https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/cosi-malta-respinge-i-migranti-e-li-dirotta-verso-libia-e-italia,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/we-give-you-30-minutes-malta-turns-migrant-boat-away-with-directions-to-italy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-greece/greece-blocks-35000-migrants-plans-to-deport-arrivals-after-march-1-idUSKBN20S0RJ,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5179,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205,https://www.instagram.com/","“While Greece and Malta are rejecting migrants, in 2020 in Italy more than 5000 sans-papiers arrived, despite the pandemic”",,,,,,

In the article Jeroen Voorbraak, director of UPL Breda, states that mancozeb is a relatively harmless substance and that it has not been shown to cause Parkinson’s disease or to have hormone-disrupting properties. His claim turns out to be mostly false. Jeroen Voorbraak is the director of UPL Breda. UPL is a company that, amongst other things, produces agrochemical products and offers crop protection solutions. For the last three years UPL is working with increasing efforts to prove the safety of the controversial pesticide mancozeb, which has been on the market since 1962. The composition of mancozeb is partially the same to that of maneb. Maneb has been banned since 2017 because it is scientifically proven that the product increases the risk of Parkinson’s disease. The similarity between the two pesticides leads to concerns about the safety of mancozeb, which the European Commission is now working on to ban as well.  Voorbraak’s claim in the Dutch newspaper Trouw, 13/03/2020 Hormone-disrupting properties Despite what Voorbraak claims, it is scientifically proven that mancozeb contains hormone-disrupting characteristics. The main metabolite in mancozeb, ETU (ethylenethiourea) was repeatedly tested on human subjects in several studies. Eventually, ETU was classified to be reprotoxic, meaning it could harm the unborn child. Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder where the neurons slowly die. A reduced production of the neurotransmitter dopamine results into the symptoms typically associated with Parkinson’s like motoric issues etc. Dick Swaab, neurobiologist specialised in Parkinson’s disease, said that the substance rotenone is used to induce Parkinson in laboratory animals. He also said that rotenone can’t be used as a pesticide because of its neurotoxic effect. Remarkably mancozeb, being similar to maneb, can be associated with rotenone but there are no studies that proof that mancozeb causes Parkinson’s disease. Cancer  In 2002 the Italian Cancer Research Center Bentivoglio started the first study on the effect of mancozeb on farmers who use this pesticide on a professional level. For over two years 150 rats were injected with mancozeb. Eventually, every single one of them died. Based on this study mancozeb is considered to be a cancerous substance.  Future On the 10th of February, a Crop Protection and Neighbourhood Committee was set up in the Netherlands. Their goal is to investigate whether there are health risks arising from the use of plant protection products. Majorie Van Duursen, Professor of Environmental Health and Toxicology at the University of Amsterdam, is a member of that committee. She told us that the European Commission will most likely propose to ban the use of mancozeb on the European market after January 2021 because of their reproductive, toxic and hormone-disturbing effects. Also the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety, ANSES, asks a ban on mancozeb in its advice of the 10th of April 2020.  Conclusion  From this information we can conclude that the claim made by Jeroen Voorbraak in Trouw about the safety of mancozeb is mostly false. Voorbraak has a point saying that there’s no proof of mancozeb causing Parkinson’s disease. Although it is scientifically proven that the pesticide influences the hormone levels in an individual and can lead to reprotoxic effects. Unfortunately we couldn’t find out which sources Voorbraak based his claim on. Voorbraak has so far not responded to us, despite our multiple efforts.

According to the text, shared on the WhatsApp platform by Brazilian users, gargling with water, salt and vinegar is sufficient to eliminate the virus from the person’s throat, where it “stays for four days before going to her lung” (data given by the same text message). This mixture, supposedly, will prevent the virus from reaching the lungs and prevent critical medical problems caused by this infection. Soon the message and new variants, were spreading over social media all over the world.  In this case, the original message came along with an audio, where an unidentified woman, speaking Portuguese, appears recommending the use of the mixture and reaffirming the information present on the text. Message in Portuguese:“O Corona vírus, antes de alcançar o pulmão ele permanece na garganta por 4 dias, esse é o tempo que a pessoa começa a tossir e ter dor na garganta. Se ela tomar muita água e gargarejo com água morna, sal ou vinagre o vírus é eliminado. Espalhe está informação porque você pode salvar alguém com está informação.”  Translation:“The Corona virus, before reaching the lungs, it remains in the throat for 4 days, this is the time where the person start to cough and have pain in the throat. If she drinks a lot of water and gargles with warm water, salt or vinegar, the virus is eliminated. Spread this information because you can save someone with this.” The World Health Organization (WHO) denied the information present in the text. According to specialists, the corona virus can cause a dry cough and sore throat, but that does not mean that the virus is housed in that particular location. As for the mixture, scientists say that it will not be effective in combating the corona virus, since its main elements have had no proven effect on the virus. However, it can be used in case of discomfort in the throat, an effect of the infection. “Gargling can be good to help relieve cough, but saying that warm water, salt and vinegar eliminates the virus is a big nonsense,” said Leonardo Weissmann, an infectious disease physician and consultant at the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, in an interview for the news vehicle G1. Too easy to be true One reason the message went viral is, according to virologist Rômulo Neris, that people got their minds focused on the symptom, which is, in fact, the pain in the throat because of coughing. However, the assumption that the homemade mix is efficient to cure infected people was completely wrong. “For the person to be experiencing the symptoms, it is because they already have the virus in multiple parts of the airways. There is no indication that the gargle with this mixture is able to eliminate the virus.” WHO say that the message is meaningless. They emphasized that saline solutions used to wash the nose do not help prevent this disease. “There is limited evidence that washing your nose regularly with saline can help people recover more quickly from common colds, but this has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.” CONCLUSION Different health organizations and specialists have denied the efficacy of water-salt-vinegar mixtures against the corona virus. Also, specialists explained that the virus doesn’t stay in the throat, the pain in this part of the body is merely a symptom of the disease. The claim is therefore False.   RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Marina Marcondes LinkedIn profile   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

83,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-maximum-level-of-fines-in-romania-is-the-highest-in-europe/,“The maximum level of fines in Romania is the highest in Europe”,2020-06-04,eufactcheck,,"On April 30, Marcel Ciolacu, the interim president of the Social Democratic Party, the main opposition party in Romania, stated on his Facebook page: “[…] The maximum level of fines in Romania is the highest in Europe, 6 times the average net salary, and the total sanctions applied reach 570 million lei […].” He also compared the situation in Romania with the ones in several other European countries: Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom, showing the difference between the average net salary and the maximum fines during the state of emergency. The comparison was based on a visual that was originally published on the subreddit r/romania, but the data the original author used does not have a clear source. Screenshot of Ciolacu’s Facebook post. The title of the visual is “The proportion of COVID fines’ highest value compared to the average wage after taxes” Claim: “The maximum level of fines in Romania is the highest in Europe” In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, Romania entered a state of emergency on March 16, 2020 for 30 days and then, on April 15, 2020, the state of emergency was extended for another 30 days. Since May 15, the country is going through a progressive relaxation of restrictions, but a state of alert is still in place. At the beginning of the state of emergency, the fines in Romania ranged between 100 and 5,000 lei (roughly between € 20 and € 1000), according to the Emergency Ordinance no. 1 of 21 January 1999, Article 28, for persons who did not comply with the amendments. Then, according to the Emergency Ordinance no. 34 of March 26, 2020, article 28, the fines were increased, and ranged between 2,000 and 20,000 lei for individuals (€ 410 – € 4100). According to latest data provided by the National Institute of Statistics, the average wage after taxes in Romania is 3,294 lei (approximately € 680). However, according to Eurostat, the average net salary in Romania equals € 633. In this context, the maximum fine you could get in Romania for not complying with the restrictions during the state of emergency meant 6 or 6.5 times the average wage. The European context According to a decree issued on March 25, Italians who do not comply with measures to prevent contamination, can be fined between € 400 and € 3000, but can also be punished with imprisonment of up to 3 months. The average net salary in Italy in 2020 is € 1801. In France, fines range from € 135 to € 3,750 or up to 6 months in prison. French citizens earn an average monthly salary of € 2213. In Spain, the fines range between € 100 and € 600,000. The € 100 to € 600  fines are applied for non-compliance with some basic rules regarding Covid-19, but they can increase up to € 30,000 if they do not have a proper attitude towards the authorities. The General Public Health Act includes fines ranging from € 3,001 to € 60,000 for serious offenses, such as the following cases: “refusal of support, assistance or cooperation to the agents of the medical authority or non-compliance with the instructions received from the competent authority, if this involves damage to others’ health”. Fines from € 60,001 to € 600,000 are for very serious cases of non-compliance: “repeated non-compliance with instructions received from the competent authority or non-compliance with a requirement thereof, if this involves serious damage to others’ health”. However, it must be mentioned that the maximum fine was never issued during the lockdown and it  could only be used in severe cases of disobedience that put the public health at risk repeatedly.  According to Eurostat, Spanish citizens earn € 1803 per month, which means that the maximum fine you could theoretically get is 332 times the average salary. In Germany, fines for emergencies range from € 25 to € 25,000. Just for not wearing a protective mask, citizens risk a fine of € 5,000. Public meetings or participation in events with more than 10 can get people fines of up to € 2,500 or € 25,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years. In Germany the average monthly net salary is € 2639, so an average German citizen who gets the maximum fine must pay roughly 10 times his monthly wage. Fines in Greece for those who break the laws on fighting Covid-19 reach up to € 300, and the average monthly salary after taxes is € 1316. The last example given by Ciolacu in his post on Facebook is the UK. Here the fines range from £ 60 (about € 67) to £ 3200 (about € 3573) for those who break the law 6 times in a row. In UK, the average salary after taxes is £ 2529 (approximately € 2824). Conclusion “The maximum level of fines in Romania is the highest in Europe” is a false statement. Some of the information related to the average net monthly income suggested by the picture posted on Facebook is false as well. In countries such as Germany or Spain, the fines can be a lot higher than in Romania. Although the fines in Romania seem to be rather high when taking into account the average net salary compared to other European countries, the maximum level of fines is not the highest in Europe. However, some of the data presented by Ciolacu is true, which is a good reason to rate his statement as mostly false.

Both NMBS and ÖBB were unable to explain where the number 10 comes from. ÖBB referred to their own web page which did include the number 10, but no source to any research files. NMBS, on the other hand, referred to the online calculation module Eco Passenger but contradicted themselves twice. They mentioned a factor 10 as well a factor 14 but couldn’t explain why. Reliable calculator, inaccurate numbers Most of our experts referred to Eco Passenger. This tool calculates how much CO2 emissions would be released over the same distance using a plane, car or train. You can change the variables such as ‘with climate factor’, or ‘occupancy rate’. This leads to very varied results. Monique Sys, institute director of the Institute for Environment & Sustainable Development (University of Antwerp), confirms the reliability of the calculator. But she concludes that trains are 5 times more ecofriendly than airplanes, not 10. Others, such as WWF, claim that trains are only 5 times more environmentally friendly than airplanes at a distance of 500 km. And even less, 2,8, on a distance over 1000 km. The Belgian politician Kim Buyst from the Flemish green party Groen confirms that the results vary a lot and go from 5 to 20 times more environmentally friendly. She claimed that there would never be an unambiguous number because the CO2 emissions depend on too many factors. Results with Eco Passenger 5 is also one of the numbers that we came upon using Eco Passenger. But we also got outcomes between numbers 4 and 20, depending on the variables we used. You can test Eco Passenger yourself, using this link: http://ecopassenger.org/bin/query.exe/en?L=vs_uic  Different trains have different CO2 emissions  Depending on what train is used for a journey, a different amount of CO2 emissions is released. In our case, the night train from Brussels to Vienna, electricity is used for the most part of the journey, which definitely makes it more environmentally friendly than trains driven by diesel. But besides the fuel, also the occupancy rate and the discarded distance can influence the result.  Conclusion We argue that this claim is uncheckable. There are simply too many factors on which the number varies.

85,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-69-of-sex-offenders-who-commit-gang-rape-in-spain-are-foreigners/,“69% of sex offenders who commit gang rape in Spain are foreigners”,2020-05-25,eufactcheck,,"On 13 February 2020, Santiago Abascal (leader of far-right wing political party in Spain, VOX) claimed in an interview in the Spanish public TV broadcaster (RTVE) that almost 70% of gang rapes in Spain are committed by foreigners. This claim is false.   Santiago Abascal is a Spanish politician that currently is the leader of the political party VOX, the main far-right wing party in Spain. VOX defends in its principles that one of their goals is the defense of the “promotion of patriotism” and the “recognition of national sovereignty corresponds to the Spanish people”. This kind of principles have made this party propose several anti-immigration measures. Abascal is one of the founders of the party, which started its political activity in 2013. Since the creation of the party, he has been leading it, being a main character in the rise of popularity of the formation. The rise of ideologically similar parties throughout Europe gave VOX their first electoral success in national elections on April 28, 2019. The party became the fifth more voted, and could enter for the very first time in the Spanish Parliament. In the same year, national elections were held again on November 10th, as there was no agreement to have a coalition government after the April results. VOX then improved their results and became the third most voted party. The statement made by Abascal was collected in an interview on February 2020, but the leader of VOX also stated similar quotes during the electoral campaigns in 2019. In this case, Santiago Abascal was interviewed in the Telediario (Daily News) of channel called La Uno, from Spanish public broadcaster Radio Televisión Española (Spanish Televisión and Radio). Some of  the topics treated during the interview were gender violence and immigration, as some of the most known measures that this party has proposed during the last year were related to both topics. During the interview, Abascal is shown a video of himself, explaining the mentioned claim.  TRANSCRIPTION OF THE INTERVIEW: “It’s useless that you (Spanish government) hide it, because there are public figures (about gender violence), that the 69% of all males accused of gang raping have been aliens, though they just represent a 10% of all Spanish population” Evidence This figure is set out in a report launched by the “Universidad Autónoma de Madrid” (Autonomous University of Madrid). This report is called “Agresores sexuales de víctima desconocida” (Sexual Assaulters of Unknown Victim). This report collects sexual assaults cases between 2009 and 2013, in which the relation between the assaulter and the victim is unknown. The report gives the following definition of what “unknown” means in this case: “when the assaulter and the victim do not know each other before the assault or they have been together earlier for a short period of time” (cuando autor y víctima no se conocen previamente a la agresión o sólo han pasado un periodo corto de tiempo juntos; p.12).  That is the main fact to disprove Abascal’s quote. When he exposes this figure, he extrapolates the sexual assaults, without mentioning the “unknown” connotation. Everytime he has claimed this sentence, he has never specified the type of assault, within the different types of attacks (domestic violence, when both assaulter and victim meet each other earlier, etc.).  Abascal bases his claim on one statement made in the report. When the report starts analyzing gang sexual assaults, there is a sentence that says, “as for the personal characteristics of the authors, there is a lower presence of Spanish aggressors (31% in group …)” (En cuanto a las características personales de los autores, hay una presencia menor de agresores españoles, 31% en grupo…, p.36. ). Nonetheless, the whole report is focused on the assaults of unknown victim (the concept explained in the paragraph above). This data, obviously, is also covered, and there are constant reminders of the type of sexual assaults the report researches, even in that same paragraph. After checking that this report would not give the accurate figures that are needed to test Abascal’s quote, another similar reports was also checked. No report was found with that exact figure, but there was another one that could give a hint about the truthfulness of Abascal’s sentence. The report analyzed is called “Informe sobre delitos contra la libertad e indemnidad sexual” (Report about crimes against sexual freedom and indemnity) , and it was launched by the Spanish Home Office. This report collects data about crimes against sexual freedom in Spain during 2017. In the report, there is a chapter focused on the profile of the assaulters. On page 28, there are some graphics about the nationality of the assaulters in all kind of sexual attacks. Clearly, the percentage shows that the number of Spanish assaulters is way higher than the alien assaulters one: Spanish assaulters (70,1%) vs. alien assaulters (29,1%). Building a bridge between these figures and the ones given by Santiago Abascal, we can discover how different both figures are. Conclusion Taking into account all data collected, we can say that the claim made by Santiago Abascal is false. First of all, we have seen how the report he uses to base his claim on is not eligible to his claim, as the report just collects data from sexual assaults where the assaulter and the victim did not know each other before. In this case, every time Abascal uses the claim, he never points out that connotation. Furthermore, we have tried to collect more data to check if that sentence could be suitable. Data about the nationality of assaulters in gang sexual attacks in Spain has not been found, but there is another figure that might help us. Collected data shows that the percentage of Spanish people that commit sexual attacks is higher than the cases that involve aliens.

86,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-microchips-are-getting-under-the-skin-of-thousands-in-sweden/,“Microchips are getting under the skin of thousands in Sweden”,2020-05-23,eufactcheck,,"News website euronews.com published a story about microchips in Sweden. Last update was introduced on 15th of May 2020. Journalist Pascale Davies wrote: “Thousands of people in Sweden are inserting tiny microchips under their skin”. The claim turns out to be true. Microchips implanted into one’s body are supposed to make daily life convenient. They open a perspective to replace traditional keys, cards, IDs, and even train tickets with a microchip. Despite how futuristic this information sounds in 2018 Business Insider published another article with attached video from AFP showing that state-owned SJ –national Swedish railway- started scanning hands of passengers with biometric chips to collect their train fare.Moreover, the article described “implant parties” organised since 2014 by Swedish biohacking group Bionyfiken. Implant parties are the type of gatherings where people can voluntarily get a microchip plugged. To exemplify the significance of microchips in Sweden, it’s worth to mention the book called  „The Swedish Chipping Phenomenon” published by Lund University in 2019. The author, Moa Petersén mentions that „ Sweden is an unique example of a country where microchipping was accepted on its social level.” In her publication we can also find some data on the number of microchips which were inserted between 2014-2018. Moa Petersén described an event from  2017 covered by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. The source reports -“The microchipping in Almedalen was organized by the Swedish state-owned train company Statens Järnvägar (SJ), and the politician Karin Svensson Smith, then chairman of the government’s traffic committee. The fact that approximately 5,500 Swedes have inserted similar microchips into their hands between 2014 and 2018 has attracted great international attention.” Additionally, to examine if the statement “Thousands of people in Sweden are inserting tiny microchips under their skin” is reliable we asked the founders of Chipster A Swedish company, which specializes in inserting implants, shared some valuable information concerning the issue. One of the co-founders Sina Amoor Pour stated – “There are approximately 6000 Swedes in total that have a chip. These are all the people that have been getting a chip since 2014.“However what Sina Amoor points out: the key factor is placing this information in the perspective of time. The Swedish biohacker explained that “in average 1000 people have been getting the chip per year since 2014. But also you need to take into account that this was a lot more popular in 2014-2016 since it was a new thing and a lot of media were reporting on it. Since then the rate of people getting a chip has declined”. This leads to the following conclusion: although, statement from Pascale Davies article is true, the headline might be misleading. It suggests that the trend is increasing lately. Which according to Sina Amoor above mentioned statement it is gradually declining since 2016. To sum up, we can examine that statement -thousands of Swedish have microchips inserted under their skin- is true. By this year there are about 6000 Swedish who have been chipped. Nevertheless, it is not a new trend and reached its peak in years 2014-2016.

87,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-our-seniors-will-be-better-protected-from-future-pandemics-if-they-age-at-home/,“Our seniors will  be better protected from future pandemics if they age at home”,2020-05-21,eufactcheck,,"Monique Boutrand, a French central administration officer and expert on ageing issues, states in an article in Le Monde that letting retired people stay in their own homes will protect them better against future pandemics than when they live in retirement homes.  This claim is uncheckable.  We are currently in a pandemic situation that is unprecedented in France. Today, more than ever, concerns for our elders are growing. The figures recorded by the Etablissements d’Hébergement pour Personnes Âgées Dépendantes (EHPAD, French retirement homes) are alarming. The establishments have had to face a great wave of contamination which has left many victims in its wake. The article by Boutrand in Le Monde On the other hand, Monique Boutrand explains in her article that the epidemic would have affected less the elderly who were confined to their homes. For the time being, the figures demonstrating and proving this fact have not yet come out. However, the curves give us a clear overview. In addition, sources external to this article state that certain facts such as the proximity to each other of nursing home residents and “the existence of common living areas may have favored the spread of the virus” and “from the moment the virus enters, it spreads very rapidly”. Thus, this makes us lean towards the idea that the statement is close to be “true”. What the expert is trying to do in her article is to make us think about the issue of retirement homes during pandemics. Are they the most suitable places to protect our elders? And, Monique Boutrand takes a stand on the development of local services and explains what should be done. Sources mentioned In support of her remarks, the specialist mentions three different sources, most of which come from reports by French government experts. To verify this information, we used multiple organizational charts to analyze the reliability of the affirmation, the author and the source. One by one we analyzed each of the sources that was mentioned in the article. Let’s take the first source as an example. This is a report by Luc Broussy entitled ‘L’adaptation de la société au vieillissement de sa population. France: année zéro!’ Even before checking the contents of this report, we have taken on the task of doing some investigations on the author Broussy. This step allowed us to know if he is indeed a reliable and credible author, whom we can trust. Luc Broussy is a member of the French government since he is the General Councillor of Val-d’Oise (department). What attracts our attention is that he is the Monthly Director of the Retirement Homes and is considered a specialist in issues related to ageing. Thanks to this analysis, we were able to conclude that Broussy’s words are worthy of consideration. In his report on the aging of the population, the specialist has taken into account numerous studies, sources and expert opinions in order to strengthen and give meaning to his claims. In one part of the dossier, he states that “future generations of older people will know better than their elders how to anticipate and predict” because they will be “fit to use technologies in the home”. Thus, he states that it is high time to think differently and that “home care policy must be the priority”. In support of the above, Broussy refers to an expert in this sector, Gilles Duthil. He is quoted as saying in a report that “the private home must now become a public matter”. All of the points that have been raised in Broussy’s case are consistent with Monique Boutrand’s article. This proves the reliability of what she is stating and brings us to the idea that the predictive claim she makes is bases on reliable assumptions. External sources We know for a fact that elderly people are more touched by the virus; they show more symptoms and have more chances to be really affected. In France  25 809 people  have died (updated on the 6/05/2020) of  Covid-19: -9 572 of them were in elderly home -16 237 of them were in the hospital. These statistics show that more than half of the population were in elderly homes. Information by Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé This table represents the percentage of mortality regarding the age in reanimation. This means that a total of 73% of the population that died in a hospital were 65 and more. We still lack information, we do not know the part of the population that was 65 or more that died in their homes and not in an elderly home. But as far as we know, people are happier in their homes than in nursing homes, as they were closed for visiting during this period of time. This article shows how much people are sadder in nursing homes and how they wish to be closer to their family, since it is their “only source of happiness”. So, to sum up: Monique Boutrand relies on three different sources from the French government to prove her assumption about future pandemics and the protection against these of elderly people. They have been proven to be reliable sources and figures since they have been treated by experts on the subject of ageing. Nevertheless, the lack of precision on certain figures and certain uncertainties leads us to say for the time being that this is not a 100% true claim. We arrive at the conclusion that the statement “Our seniors will  be better protected from future pandemics if they age at home” is uncheckable.

88,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-vaccination-and-chipping-will-be-mandatory/,“Vaccination and chipping will be mandatory”,2020-05-19,eufactcheck,,"Famous Croatian singer Tony Cetinski expressed his fear of vaccinating and chipping by claiming it is becoming mandatory and going as far as to predict that the future COVID-19 vaccine will be a disguise for injecting people with microchips. This happened on Facebook and Instagram and soon became the “talk of the town” across Croatian mainstream media channels.   Tony Cetinski, in a post on his Facebook profile in May said: “This is the last I have to say about vaccination. Chipping will also, as it seems, go under mandatory principle”, echoed far and beyond Croatian public sphere. As the topic continues to rile up his supporters as well as his opponents, we decided to check the stronghold of this particular claim, but also the discourse around it, which is ever so topical. During the pandemic of COVID-19 not only the virus is spreading by an enormous rate. Conspiracy theories resulting in a huge number of fake news are taking more space in the public than ever before thus affecting opinions and lives of many. World Health Organisation even called this phenomenon – ”infodemic”. COVID-19 vaccine is not even fully developed by scientists and it has already initiated many discussions. From government officials deciding on vaccination being mandatory and possible injection of the microchip through COVID-19 vaccination procedure to the standard so called “anti-vax” theories.   It seems like “anti-vaxxers” have taken this pandemic as an opportunity to boost their movements in peculiar ways. This situation is also used for political propaganda and obtaining leverage in upcoming elections by some populist parties. Previous fake news and false statements of this kind are numerous: Bill Gates trying to make COVID-19 vaccine a mandatory one for the purpose of microchipping and tracking people; widely spread alleged statement of the president of the European Commission on vaccine being mandatory and expensive; video montage of thousands of people protesting against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in Poland. These “fake news” which are spread across multiple media outlets are just threads composing a massive conspiracy theory web.  In this case we are talking of a regionally well-known singer with a big auditorium using it for the anti-vaccination private campaign of some kind. This specific statement of Tony Cetinski can be put side by side with other conspiracy theories on this topic. Though singer later tried to explain he wasn’t talking about microchipping during the vaccination procedure, he first clearly stated otherwise. Still, he was and remained persistent with his claims that vaccination will be mandatory. On a daily basis, Cetinski, on his social media channels, has been pointing out people’s right to refuse to undergo any vaccination procedures themselves and in their children’s name. He even goes as far as posting questionable lists of alleged components and dangers of various common vaccines.  Nonetheless, our research shows that a statement of this kind is by all means false and has no base in scientific discoveries nor is confirmed by any treaties signed by politicians. Mandatory COVID-19 vaccination and politicians signing agreements on that matter has been proven false several times since corona virus outbreak. In Croatia, like in every country, list of mandatory vaccines is written and published by the Institute of Public Health. No decisions are made and no treaties are signed by the current Croatian right-wing government on the matter of microchipping or mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. The newest governments’ decisions on combating corona virus with the help of a new mobile app, that is being developed for few weeks now, is the closest to artificial intelligence tracking movement and contacts of Croatian citizens.  Moreover, according to American Veterinary Medical Association microchipping is a process which, biologically speaking, is not done through blood stream. It usually acquires thick skin layer where it is typically put, using a hypodermic needle, in many mammals such as dogs and cats. This ensures it staying in one place. According to AVMS microchip is not a GPS device and cannot track animals. Scientifically, correlation between vaccination and microchipping is not found as scientists emphasize every time a disinformation on this matter is published. In conclusion, as one Croatian molecular biologist claimed, saying that governments would microchip us to track our movement and obtain control over us, is more than illogical when given the fact we already live in a society with a high percent of mobile phone users, GPS tracking systems, satellites and other advanced technology we use every day claims  Giving expertise across social networks on a topic that is, by all logic, to be discussed by experts and spreading conspiracy theories is a new pastime for multiple Croatian and worldwide celebrities.  Cetinski is by no means the first public person to bring light onto the anti-vaxing theory. The most prominent one in Croatia is, to this day, well-known populist politician Ivan Pernar. He immediately supported Cetinski on his social media profiles. However, Cetinski’s biggest famous supporter is Dejan Lovren, FC Liverpool and Croatian national team player. Soon after he expressed his agreement with Cetinski, the two held another Facebook livestream. Context for this could be tracked to Croatia national football team’s success in the 2018 World Cup. Pernar was quick to realize this, so he has publicly claimed that Lovren said how the entire national team is behind him in a telephone conversation. The feedback went both ways resulting in one Croatian local radio station’s editor announcing to cease playing Cetinski’s songs in his’ radio program. The clash went as far as Cetinski planning to sue the editor . Furthermore, Gordan Lauc, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, firmly judged Cetinski and Lovren in an interview for one popular Croatian evening news show. He claimed that the pair is talking about dangerous things while exploiting their popularity. Cetinski’s original Facebook livestream has attracted like-minded people and his social network activity increased significantly. As he gathers supporters, the problematic of social network bubbles rises. Following only those who offer the same view of the topic as one’s own means getting nothing but conformation of one’s opinion. No matter how important seeing all the sides of a topic is, Cetinski continues his campaign against vaccination on social media channels. The number of his Facebook followers increased rapidly, quadrupling from 3000 to over 12 000 in no time. This raises the question of personal and social responsibility: if one is a public persona and knows that their voice will reach thousands, are they allowed to publish their thoughts on sensitive topics that are outside of their field of expertise?  Cetinski is proving daily how certain in what he believes he is. After recognizing the backlash, he explained himself in a statement for the local online news outlet Glas Istre. He said that it was not his intention to cause a riot and that he was merely trying to have a conversation with his online friends. He admitted not being particularly skilful with Facebook, but he soon recognized the attention he was gaining. That only made him more wishful to prove his point. Taking COVID-19 pandemic into the consideration, not only has it changed people’s outer lives with many restraints, but it has also affected their inner lives – now it is so easy to indulge into gloomy perspectives. People fear for their lives and their loved ones, and with that comes general mistrust in authorities. When a public person that seems so familiar, because of their long existence in the public eye, states their mistrust and strong opinions about a controversial topic, it becomes so much more than a personal thought. With over 30 years of singing career, Cetinski has experience in the media and public relations. One may argue that amidst rapid media change Cetinski truly wasn’t aware of the impact he was making. However, it may seem in the beginning, two weeks in from the original livestream, he has wholeheartedly taken on a role of anti-vax advocate. As he tries to explain how he didn’t try to portray an expert and was just expressing his opinion, his initial reach to public was in an extremely certain and expert-like manner. That has only increased as his source material remain thoughts of his like-minders and vaguely verified scientific claims written in a language professional enough not to be clear to a non-expert. Social media is by its nature a democratic vessel – it has given everyone a platform to raise their voice, but it does not matter how loud one is shouting, if they do not have an audience. Celebrities like Cetinski, with a numerous pre-made audience, have a certain social responsibility. This does not by any mean deprive them from sharing their thoughts, but it obliges them to dwell deeper into the topic and research it thoroughly before they go into further public discussion. That being said, that responsibility lies on all social media users. The only difference is that an anonymousness’ thoughts will not reach such a grand number of people in the public arena.    In conclusion, we asses that Cetinski’s claim was false. His raise of panic proved to be unnecessary – mandatory chipping is nowhere in the foreseeable future, let alone microchipping hidden in vaccines.

In the article, the journalist Tom Le Bacq gives rates about how many people are supporting the measures of the lock down.  Barely 63 per cent of the Belgian population are supporting the measures of the lockdown, with young adults the support is less than 50 per cent. Who are these percentages based on? Tom Le Bacq mentions in Het Nieuwsblad that he has the figures from a survey carried out by the University of Ghent, Belgium, on the motivation of the Belgian population to abide by the Belgian rules of lockdown. The article also contains graphs from the study where the two percentages are clearly shown. You can find the same graphs below.       Belgium measures First of all, what exactly are these Belgian measures? The main measures correspond to the other European countries. Staying inside is the norm. In addition, you have the social distancing rule (1.5 meters distance between people), exception to this rule are the people you live with. It is allowed to meet with two people to sport outdoors or go for a walk. You must be sure that you comply with the social distancing rule and the walk must be nearby. Belgians are only allowed to use the car for essential journeys. This includes going to the supermarket, to the pharmacy, to the doctor or to work. Also, in the supermarket and pharmacy there are measures. For example, only a limited number of people may be in the shop at the same time. The measure whereby the Belgian population would mainly lose their motivation is the social distancing rule.   Marathon effort Not only Het Nieuwsblad wrote about the motivation that disappears to comply with the measures. The quality magazine Knack also talked about a marathon effort in an opinion. The author describes it as follows: “The lockdown period is beginning to weigh on many. Keeping a close eye on the measures can be compared to running a marathon. Around kilometre 30 quite a few marathon runners get a motivation dip. The light at the end of the tunnel is not yet visible and the efforts begin to weigh. That gnaws at their motivation.” The other classical media in Belgium also write about it, such as Gazet van Antwerpen and VRTNWS. Remarkably, they all use the same source: the survey of Ghent University.   “How are you doing in your room” Since 19 March, the start of the lockdown, Ghent University has been measuring the motivation of the Belgian population to comply with the measures on a daily basis. The study is based on an online survey ‘How are you doing in your room’ in which motivation, resilience and wellbeing are examined. Ghent University says that this study is necessary because the motivation of the Belgian population reflects the support for the lockdown measures and indicates to what extent the population remains willing to follow the measures. According to Maarten Vansteenkiste, moral psychologist and researcher at Ghent University, more motivation is not necessarily a better thing. There are two types of motivation: Voluntary motivation (the population remains fully convinced of the need for the measures, there adhere to the measures on their own initiative) and Compulsory motivation – ‘mustivation’ (the population feels obliged to comply with the measures, in this way you avoid a fine, criticism or disdain of others). According to the graph, this voluntary motivation is visibly declining. In the first week, 81% of the interviewees were still convinced of the measures. In the third week it was only 76% and now they speak of 63%. The study also states that the number of police interventions in Belgium is increasing, but they don’t give clear figures or percentages. The police would have to hand out more and more fines because people do not comply with the measures. Because Belgians would become more and more nonchalant in complying. The Belgian media talk about lockdown parties. The police also report on 19 April 2020 about a lockdown party they have to shut down. Also, most of the Belgians I ask if they are following the measures answer in the same way: “I am still following the measures, but no one knows how long the lockdown will last. I’m counting down to see friends and family again.” The motivation of a large number of the Belgian population has changed into mustivation.   Number of young adults The percentages are based on a number of 18,476 participants of which 74% were women. According to a study, figures for a sample hardly change from 20,000 people. The question is of course whether the percentages are then reliable. Since the figure is below 20,000. They do not write in the study how many people of each age participated. We only have a general number of participants. This means that we do not know how many participants are young adults.   Conclusion The claim is mostly true. We cannot say with certainty that the claim is completely correct. Since there is uncertainty about the number of participants that were young adults. The number of participants may also be just too few to make a statement like this. Very important is the fact that all media rely on a certain source: the survey of Ghent University. From different angles it is clear that the motivation has decreased. The survey also shows this decrease.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE : Alice Schoutsen    Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

The claim turns out to be uncheckable. In the article reporter Rosie McCall tries to prove the statement using the survey “How Leader Gender Influences External Audience Response to Organizational Failures“. Researchers from University of Virginia – Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen who specialize in marketing, in a summary of their study published in the “Journal of Personality and social psychology” stated: “People respond more negatively to ethical failures when an organization has a female versus a male leader.” The main reason for that outcome are gender stereotypes. Daily life situations As Polish professor who analyzes women’s participation in media, from the Department of Press Systems and Press Law at Adam Mickiewicz University Alina Balczyńska-Kosman explains:“Stereotypes are very solid cognitive structures shaped on a ground of knowledge, beliefs and expectations. Stereotypes shape specific roles, and those roles through media are becoming more present.” Professor Balczyńska-Kosman furthers their clarification:“With regards to stereotypical way of seeing women’s role in the public sphere, it is worth noticing that numerous information programs analyses indicate that media reporters use different framing depending on gender when it comes to figures on  leader positions.” This is one of the examples which sheds some light onto an issue of women’s image with regards to a more media-focused point of view.  However, it has to be noted that although the problem appears in daily life situations the Newsweek reporter previously mentioned study “How Leader Gender Influences External Audience Response to Organizational Failures” in the context of Rosie McCall statement cannot be taken without any objections. “Greater penalties”? Professor Iwetta Andruszkiewicz from the Department of Social and Economic Policy at UAM – who works as an expert for business organizations, associations and foundations which pursue projects concerning the female role – noted that the thesis was made on the basis of a hypothetical situation. Thus this particular experiment cannot be used to support the statement:Female CEOs face ‘greater penalties’ than male CEOs for ethical transgressions. The specialist also points out that “our attitude towards other people, usually is an effect of stereotypically judgemental approach and personal features. The differences in management styles are the result of gender stereotypes. One should always remember about professional competences and personality traits.” Additionally, another problem can be encountered when evaluating the phrase used in the statement –  “greater penalties” –  due to its qualitative character the statement cannot be fully checked.  Society’s expectations Nevertheless, the question which remains open is: What is the current outlook on female participation in business? Professor Iwetta Andruszkiewicz shared her statement concerning that issue: “My experience and research (and global statistics) show that we live in a world where most of the positions with significant importance in business are reserved for men, women must work very hard for their success – society expects more from them”. In conclusion this statement is uncheckable as the Newsweek reporter’s statements were based on observations not quantitative data.  This study contained very specific hypothetical situations which cannot be used to back up such a general claim that female CEOs face ‘greater penalties’ than male CEOs for ethical transgressions.

It has become a fund without conditionalities”,2020-04-30,eufactcheck,,"The President of European Parliament David Sassoli claims on Twitter that the old European Stability Mechanism (ESM) doesn’t exist anymore and it has become a fund that all member countries can take advantage of without conditionalities, to cope with medical emergency caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The claim seems to be his remark following the Eurogroup videoconference of 9 April 2020. Sassoli mentions assets for hospitals, medical staff and other useful equipment to grant health safety.   The Eurogroup of 9 April 2020 was commissioned to find a comprehensive economic policy response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The result of the videoconference is a proposal in 23 points. Point 16 refers to ESM, a fund to grant conditional financial assistance to member countries that are experiencing temporary difficulties in raising funds on the market, despite having sustainable public debts. Paragraph 16 states that the only requirement to access the credit line will be its use to support domestic financing of direct and indirect healthcare, cure and prevention related costs due to the COVID 19 crisis. Sassoli’s claim is incorrect, since it is not complete. As a matter of fact, paragraph 16 specifies that euro area Member States will remain committed to strengthen economic and financial foundation, consisting in EU economic and fiscal coordination and surveillance frameworks, including any flexibility applied by the EU institutions. Going further, it is false that the so called “old” ESM doesn’t exist anymore, for two reasons. On the one hand, the mechanism to access credit lines remains regulated in the Treaty for all others requests of financial support, not related to healthcare costs due to the pandemic. On the other hand, the Eurogroup has no power to decide, but only to approve a proposal to be voted on by the European Council and the European Commission. The new conditions to access credit lines are not yet operational. CONCLUSION The claim is mostly false. A window on to ESM for coping with Covid-19 emergency has been opened indeed, but Sassoli’s claim is incorrect. It can be considered as a political declaration of intent, aimed at conveying trust and reliability to member countries. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

Van Brempt is a Member of European parliament for the Flemish socialist party sp.a. Her claim is true. In the European Parliament, Kathleen Van Brempt is responsible for energy and environmental management. She extracted the information from a report ‘Select Committee on Electric Vehicles’ published by the Senate of Australia in January 2019. In the report the National Transports Commission states that, when compared globally, “the CO2 emission intensity for passenger cars in Australia during 2017 was 171.5g/km, 45 % higher than the European average of 118.5 g/km.”  Lax emission standards Mark Pecqueur, researcher in Vehicle Technology at Thomas More University college in Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Belgium, says that this can be explained by the lax CO2 emission standards in Australia, which are on average 192g/km, compared to the European standard of 130g/km. Pecqueur highlights that as a result, Australian vehicles are equipped with a heavier engine which results in higher CO2 emission levels. In conclusion, the claim written by Kathleen Van Brempt in De Standaard about CO2 emission of Australian cars is true.

93,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-british-tv-presenter-claimed-that-media-didnt-know-5g-doesnt-cause-covid-19/,“British TV presenter claims that media didn’t know 5G doesn’t cause covid-19”,2020-04-28,eufactcheck,,"The British morning television presenter Eamonn Holmes recently said on air that the media in the United Kingdom did not know for sure that 5G does not cause covid-19. Telecom masts in Great Britain have been the target of several attacks by people as a conspiracy theory claiming that the 5G signal causes covid-19 has spread across the country. Multiple British media reported on the story and denied the theories.‘’What I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true,’’ Eamonn Holmes said on Monday, April 13 on the morning programme ‘’This Morning’’ which he presents on ITV. Because of the theories, the British telecommunications company BT experienced 22 of its masts attacked over the Easter holiday whilst Vodafone had had 20 masts attacked according to Reuters.  CLAIM: Was Eamonn Holmes correct in saying that the British mainstream media did not know that the conspiracy theories regarding 5G and covid-19 were false, when they reported them as being false?  Are the theories untrue?A premise for fact-checking Eamonn Holmes’ claim is that the conspiracy theories are untrue. According to the theories, the symptoms of covid-19 are caused by electromagnetic radiation and not by a virus. An obvious problem with this theory is that 5G antennas are not present in, for example, Iran, which by April 22 had almost 85,000 confirmed cases of covid-19 according to Johns Hopkins University.Other theories claim that 5G might suppress the immune system and that viruses can communicate through radio waves. An independent UK fact-checking charity called Full Fact has debunked these theories saying that ‘’there is no evidence that 5G WiFi networks are linked to the new coronavirus’’ also referring to the fact that covid-19 is present in countries that don’t have 5G antennas. The new 5G masts do use a higher frequency than the older generations of masts, but the maximum levels of electromagnetic radiation from them are still approximately 66 times lower than the international safety limits meaning that the signals are not dangerous or harmful. Instead, coronavirus is believed to have been transferred from bats to humans potentially via an intermediate species. Sky News has reported that spike proteins and molecules on the outside of the virus are strong evidence that the virus evolved organically according to scientists. X-ray images and CT scans also show how covid-19 patients’ lungs fill with a sticky mucus leaving no space behind for air. This 3D video from @RSNA shows what are called ground-glass opacities in the lungs of a #COVID-19 patient. These opacities on the CT scan indicate pneumonia as the spaces which are normally filled by air are being filled with something else.Read more: https://t.co/whj7XQVITe pic.twitter.com/SQdoervbNO— Sky News Tech (@SkyNewsTech) March 12, 2020 How did the media report?The day after making his claim, Eamonn Holmes wanted to clarify his comments saying that his intention was to highlight that ‘’many people are rightly concerned and are looking for answers, and that’s simply what I was trying to impart yesterday.”The attacks on 5G masts have been widely covered by the British media. And now that we know that the theories are untrue, the question then is whether the media knew this when they did their reporting, which Eamonn Holmes claimed that they did not. On April 14 just past midnight, the tabloid newspaper The Sun published a story about the chief executive of the telecommunications company BT Philip Jansen calling the attacks senseless. As mentioned earlier, the BT company had more than 20 masts attacked during Easter and according to this article, the total number was over 30. To back the BT boss, The Sun quoted The World Health Organisation (WHO) for saying that ‘’Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. Covid-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.” The paper also quoted National Medical Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis saying that the theories were ‘’utter rubbish’’. Sky News used the same quotes in an article where they also referred to multiple British professors saying that the theories were wrong. One of them, Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that a connection between the masts and the virus would be “both a physical and biological impossibility”.The Guardian also reported on the case with many articles referring to the theories as false. Like other media, they quote Stephen Powis and refer to Full Fact. In addition to this, they also quote Dr Eric van Rongen, the chair of The International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection, for saying about 5G that ‘’the guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process.’’ CONCLUSIONRegardless of what Eamonn Holmes says that he actually meant with his claim, there is a lot of evidence that the spread of covid-19 is not linked to 5G. The British media knew this when they reported about the attacks on the antennas. This fact check has presented some of this evidence, and all of the sources used are either British media or sources that British media have referred to. All of the sources are considered highly creditable and trustworthy. The media used these sources as evidence that the conspiracy theory was wrong before Eamonn Holmes’ said that they did not know that the theory was wrong. Therefore, his claim is false.       Research | Article : Jonas Bisgaard Kristensen  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

CLAIM Is Rutger Bregman correct in claiming that long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?  What were they talking about? On Friday March 20, DWDD did not start at seven o’clock as usual. It was a very rare evening on Dutch television. The Dutch King Willem-Alexander spoke to the people about COVID-19. Apart from his yearly Christmas speech, the Dutch king had not held a national speech on television since July 21, a few days after the MH17 plane crash.*) A speech like this is very unusual and special according to Carla van Baalen, professor of parliamentary history at Radboud University and director of the Centre for Parliamentary History. ‘’If the head of state holds a speech on national television apart from his Christmas speech then the circumstances in the country must be terrible’’, she says to daily Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. From his office in Huis ten Bosch, The Hague, the King spoke for seven minutes to the people about the coronavirus. He expressed words of comfort and encouraged people to stay strong during these difficult times. Read the King’s full speech here. After the Kings lasts words, the recognizable music intro of DWDD started and talk show host Matthijs van Nieuwkerk opened the show. The first thing he did was asking his guests what they thought of the speech. Discussion about the effects of the corona crisis in follow up of the King’s speech, in De Wereld Draait Door, a renown Dutch talk show. Loneliness virus One of the guests at Nieuwkerk’s table was Rutger Bregman. He is an historian and author who became an overnight social media sensation after he told billionaires at the World Economic Forum in Davos that they should stop avoiding paying tax. When it was his time to answer Nieuwkerk’s question, he started talking about what the King had said about loneliness and coronavirus: “If you are insecure and afraid, the need for contact with other people is big. You prefer familiar faces around you.Thankfully, there is still a lot we can do. We all know someone in our vicinity who will be needing people to look out for them. This is something we need to get through together and many people realize that.’’ The King ended his lines about loneliness with the message that we cannot stop the coronavirus, but we can stop the loneliness virus. ‘’Let’s make sure nobody feels abandoned.’’  Bregman agreed with the King. He said that the loneliness virus is one of the biggest challenges nowadays and continued talking about the lack of measures that the Dutch government in his eyes takes to prevent the loneliness virus. ‘’The cabinet has announced a gigantic economic stimulus package to combat an economic recession, but what we need is a social stimulus package’’, said Bregman to Nieuwkerk. He went on about loneliness as a challenge. It is deadly he said. ‘’Long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.’’ Loneliness in the Netherlands Public Health and Care.info, a website from the Dutch government that offers scientifically substantiated information about diseases, health, care and costs, published the most recent figures about loneliness in the Netherlands. In 2016, 43 per cent of the adult population (19 years and older) said that they felt lonely. Ten per cent feels serious to very serious loneliness. The definition used in this context was that loneliness is a negative situation, perceived through loss and disappointment. Loneliness is a personal, subjective experience. Feelings of loneliness mainly relate to defects in the quality of relationships. But someone can also feel lonely when the number of social contacts is lower than desired. Loneliness and smoking; the comparison Paul van de Lange, professor of Social Psychology, said to EenVandaag, that when you feel lonely you mainly need vitamin S, social relations. ‘’So you can share your feelings with someone you trust.’’ He also says that chronic loneliness can lead to depression and heart and vascular diseases. ‘’Just like smoking 15 cigarettes a day does.’’ In 2010 Julianne Holt-Lunstad published research that showed this comparison as well. In her study ‘Social Relationships and Mortality Risk’, she concluded that the influence of social relationships on risk for mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality. Lonely people are fifty per cent more likely to die prematurely than people with strong social relationships. “Humans need others to survive,” said Holt-Lunstad. ‘’Social connection is crucial to human development, health, and survival.” CONCLUSION: The claim is true: long-term loneliness is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. * On 17 July 2014 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down and crashed in Eastern Ukraine.  All passengers and crew died. 196 passengers were from the Netherlands.

His claim turns out to be true. The European Union has imposed regulations considering the energy-efficiency of electric devices in the past, and will very likely continue to do so in the future. The manufacturers of electric appliances, inside as well as outside of the EU, have to meet those demands in order to be able to offer their products on the market, says Wyns, who specializes in climate and industrial policy and the innovation strategies that could be applied in these sectors.  Ecodesign requirements The standards Wyns refers to are more commonly known as ‘ecodesign requirements’. Concretely, these are demands set by the EU for the energy-efficiency of electric devices, in order to improve their ecology and sustainability. The requirements can either be specific (e.g. a minimum value of recycled material) or generic (e.g. the product is recyclable). The ecodesign requirements apply to a variety of electric appliances (e.g. boilers, computers, refrigerators, etc.). If any of these products fails to meet the standards, it can’t be distributed in the European Union. Hence, every electric device you own meets the standards, whether the producer is European, American, Japanese or based in any other country. Going from your South-Korean Samsung-television over your American iPhone to your German Siemens’ washing machine, every single one of these products has to fulfil the EU’s demands.  The Brussels effect Wyns’ claim is based upon the ‘Brussels effect’ theory. This theory states that non-EU countries are inclined to copy rules set by the European Union, because of Europe’s market size and importance. Foreign manufacturers might miss a lot of profit if they don’t live up to the EU’s demands and, as a result, can’t offer their products on the European market. So, the Brussels effect is a proven and repeated market mechanism. In fact, the European Union has the power to de facto, not necessarily de jure, manifest its laws outside its borders. The EU itself is also aware of this market mechanism. However, the European Union stresses that its regulations do not obligatory apply to non-EU countries nor will they automatically be copied by non-EU member states. On the other hand, the European Union also experiences that other countries look up at Europe and take a leaf out of its book when it comes to developing their own policies considering ecodesign. REACH, EU-regulations for the registration, evaluation and admission of chemical products, is an already existing example illustrating the Brussels effect. South Korea partly adopted the European Union’s plan, made some adjustments and called their version K-REACH. Conclusion Wyns’ claim is based upon a proven and acknowledged market mechanism. On top of that, the European Union itself has experienced other countries adopting their regulations and therefore also recognises this phenomenon. In conclusion, Wyns’ claim is based on facts and supported by the European government. Therefor it is true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

But how frequently exactly? According to Belgian Minister of Asylum and Migration Maggie De Block (Open VLD, Flemish liberal party), one in three of all refugees who returned via Frontex last year were from Belgium. But that happens to be not completely correct. Frontex, also known as the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, supports Schengen Associated Countries in managing the EU’s external borders and fighting cross-border crime. Whenever a country wants to legally send refugees back to their home country, they can make use of funds from Frontex. Belgium indeed used these funds, but not as much as stated by De Block. She stated that a third of all individuals who were sent back with the help of Frontex were from Belgium, which amounts to 1540 according to De Block. 1540 or 15 850? The Frontex website published this document this year. On page five, the document specifies that last year a total 15 850 people were returned by Frontex. Now take the 1540 that we had earlier. According to De Block that would be a third of the total, which is 15 850. So something is not correct. But what exactly?   According to the Frontex publication a total of 15.850 people were returned by Frontex.  We sent an email to Belgian weekly Knack, where the claim was published, to ask about their sources. They had mailed Frontex asking if these numbers were correct. Frontex responded to them saying that they indeed helped Belgium with returning 1565 people – which is a bit more than stated by De Block, but within range.  Commercial vs chartered flights However, these 1565 people were returned via commercial flights. And the total of people returned via commercial flights last year is 4776. Although 1565 is indeed one third of 4776, that does not mean that Belgium uses a third of all funds for people returned by Frontex. Because people returned via commercial flights comprise less than a third of all people returned. So De Block only took commercial flights in account. But besides commercial flights, Frontex helped Belgium return another 205 people via chartered flights which brings the total for Belgium up to 1770. With a total of 15 850 people Belgium only makes up about 11% of all returns by Frontex. Which is a third of what De Block claimed. To conclude, we consider De Block’s claim mostly false because she takes only a part of all the flights into account. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

It says that the Sejm of Lithuania has decided to impose large fines on those merchants who give free plastic bags to customers. The only exception applies for the bags which thickness does not exceed 15 microns and which are used for bulk products. The Belarusian Russian-language media says that at the request of the European Union, fines were imposed in Lithuania for the free distribution of plastic bags. It was stated in the Sejm press-release. The news article says that there will be large fines for breaking the law. The largest of which is 5 000 euros. The amendments were made to the Law on Environmental Protection and the Code of Administrative Offenses. The decision was unanimous. In order to factcheck the information we visited the Sejm official website  and then found «Visuomenei ir žiniasklaidai» section which translates as «For the public and the media» and subsection «Naujienos» with the news. On the right side there is a list of sections one of which is dedicated to information on the Sejm meetings. After scrolling downwards you can see a post from 23.01.2020, which we were looking for. After clicking on the post you can see that there is indeed a liability for the free distribution of lightweight plastic shopping bags. However, the Belarusian media claims that for breaking the law you will only have to pay a fine. But on the Sejm website it says that apart from the fine the perpetrator will face a warning. Also there is information that 63 members of the Seimas voted in favor, but one abstained. Thus, we can conclude that the news presented by the Belarusian website is mostly true. Fines are indeed levied, but this is not the only punishment. One abstention does not give the journalist the right to say that the decision was unanimous.

His claim turns out to be mostly false. Croatia has assumed presidency of the Council of the European Union on 1st January 2020. The government has presented this to Croatians as a great honor rather than a well-established obligational six-month rotation presidency. While the traffic in the capital city of Zagreb is in shambles over the many delegation groups coming to Croatia, Croatians are constantly searching for a better life.  Unfortunately, Croatia has become well known for losing a lot of its young adult population. Since 2013 young adults see a better future outside of Croatia, they gravitate to other EU countries. This fact is hardly surprising if we take into consideration that Croatia’s corruption index is alarmingly high compared to the other European Union countries. This causes mistrust in governance, and holds back growth.  In a statement for the media Andrej Plenković says that whilst he came into office in the year 2016 the average pay in Croatia has increased with 800 kunas (around 107 euros), and that the average pay in Zagreb (Croatia’s capital) is around 1000 euros. Plenković also states that through indexation the pensions in Croatia have increased more than 12 percent.  We checked the data, and indeed the average pay in Croatia did increase with 109 euros for the period from October 2016 up until June 2019. The pensions have also increased, though our numbers do not match the prime minister’s. But the main problem is that these numbers were taken out of context, and when compared to other important data they do not paint such a pretty picture of the prime minister’s government.  The average pay in Croatia The Croatian Bureau of Statistics says that the average net pay in October 2016 was 745 euros. From the same source the average net pay for June 2019 was 854 euros. Applying a simple calculation we can see that the average pay did indeed increase for 109 euros. The average gross pay for the same period increased from 1014 euros to 1161 euros – that’s 147 euros.  The average net and gross salaries are not as reliable as the median salary, because the median salary is not effected by extremes. The median salary for October 2016 was 628 euros and for June 2019 it was 738 euros. We can acknowledge an increase of 110 euros, but this is a smaller increase than the increase of the gross pay for those periods in Croatia. Nevertheless, they are still in accordance with the prime minister’s statement.  In June 2019 there were over one million employees in Croatia, the median pay tells us that over 600 000 employees received a maximum pay of 738 euros per month for their living expenses. This presents a more honest picture than simply stating there was a 109 euros pay increase. We conclude that the data regarding the increase in pay is correct. Nevertheless, the prime minister did not mention the equal importance of continuous growth of living expenses. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics states that the prices of goods and services for individual consumption (measured by the consumer price index) are growing since 2016, so this has a great impact on Croatian households.  Professor Vladimir Arčabić, who teaches classes such as Macroeconomics and Economic development at the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb, explains: “The Croatian Bureau of statistics provides a price analysis of exact products in shops throughout Croatia. The prices are represented by an index and if there is a change in the index it’s regarded as an increase of general prices.”  The data states prices have changed a lot for the time period from 2016 to 2019. General prices in stores have grown substantially. For one shopping basket in September 2019 a Croatian would on average pay 3.6 percent more than he or she would have in September 2016. For the period from 2016 to the end of 2018 the average price for products has increased by 2.6 percent.  Even though the average paycheck did increase, the impact isn’t that impressive since living expenses in Croatia continue to grow as well. Croatians are mostly unsatisfied with their financial situation. Eurostat states that on a scale from 0 to 10 Croatia measures a 4.6 with their satisfaction with finances. For example in Slovenia, Croatia’s neighboring country it comes to a 5.6 out of 10. And in Romania that constitutes one the Presidency Trio of the Council of the European Union with Croatia, overall financial satisfaction is even higher and comes to a 6.2 out of 10.  A 1000 euros pay within context Regarding the average pay in Zagreb, the City Office for Strategic Planning and Development  states that for July 2019 the average net pay was 984 euros. The gross pay for the same period was 1386 euros. The average paycheck in Zagreb has been steadily growing since 2016 when the average net pay was 868 euros. Throughout 2017 and 2018 the average net pay was 935 euros and 956 euros, the biggest increase was from 2016 to 2017. The net pay in Zagreb is indeed around 1000 euros, but we must mention the growing living expenses in Zagreb. The statistical yearbook of the city of Zagreb for 2019 states that the prices for individual expenses in 2018 were 3, 4 % higher than in 2016. The living expenses have also grown for 3, 8 % since 2016 when prime minister Plenković was sworn into office. Again we have the correct numbers but they are taken out of context.  The rise in pensions Prime minister Andrej Plenković states that through indexation the pensions in Croatia increased more than 12 percent. Indexation, as Prof. Arčabić says, is a process in which by law regulations the pensions are increased or decreased in accordance with prices and paychecks. Statistical information provided by the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute states that the average pension for September 2016 was 321 euros. In July 2019 the average pension was 351 euros. From the statistical data we calculated an increase in the pensions of 8, 4 percent in July 2019 since September 2016.  Professor Arčabić observed the total pensions which included the old age pension, disability and family pensions. In September 2019 the pensions for July were 321 euros and in September 2016 it was 297 euros. This comes to a difference of 8.22 percent. He says that the results differ and depend on the data that is used. Context beats ‘facts’ To conclude, the pensions in the prime ministers mandate did not increase for more than 12 percent, the total pension growth for the mentioned period comes down to 8,4 percent. Except for the pensions, the numbers the prime minister states are mostly correct. What is missing in the statement is the context, particularly the growth in living expenses. This would undermine the positive light in which the prime minister has presented his mandate and government. We contacted Professor Marijana Grbeša- Zenzerović, who teaches classes such as Media and the Public and Political Marketing at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Zagreb. We asked why and in which way do politicians handle information and why is information usually presented out of context. She says this is called framing. “It’s a technique in which one controls information by highlighting certain information, and disregarding the rest. This is done to create a reality, or to present one’s picture of reality”, adding that framing is used both by media and politicians. Conclusion Taking all of the information stated in this text, we would evaluate the prime minister’s statement as mostly false. Even though two out of three figures used in the claim are on their own correct, when they are presented within context they tell us a different, more accurate story about Croatia’s economy.

Among his wishes, and retrospective of 2019, he stated that “more than 500,000 jobs were created since May 2017” (the quote is stated at 1.49), this date marking the start of his mandate.  So, is this affirmation true? After doing some research on row numbers, it turns out it is.     IMAGE: screenshot taken from the new year’s speech by President Macron, on the 31st of December 2019. The full speech can be seen here.  The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) conducts yearly trimester studies on jobs creation. Taking into account only the last two trimesters of 2017 (trimester 3 and trimester 4) -as Mr Macron started his mandate almost mid-year- that is about 117,200 of jobs created. For the year 2018, the statistics show that 149,600 jobs were created (this is combined total of trimester 1, trimester 2, trimester 3 and trimester 4). Finally, still according to the Insee, the number goes up to 263,000 for 2019 (here are the numbers for trimester 1, trimester 2 and trimester 3) so far.  The study for the last trimester of 2019 will be released in March, but the three trimesters suffice to get an overall number of 529,800 for the three years since May 2017, when Macron took office.  Newspaper Le Monde added an Insee statistic of jobs that were created between the end of the third trimester and the end of the year 2019, which is not yet officially released. Its is to be noted that the numbers include both the private and public sectors; and take into account the loss of jobs.

According to EU environmental laws domestic cats should be banned from roaming outside since they are a danger to wildlife. This was originally claimed by two law-researchers of the university of Tilburg in an article in the Journal of Environmental Law (Oxford Academic). By looking at EU environmental laws and siding this with data about the effect of domestic cats on wildlife researchers Arie Trouwborst and Han Somsen came to the conclusion that member states are obligated to ban cat-owners from letting their cats roam outside. In the article’s conclusion the authors write: “It is well recognised that biodiversity loss is one of the most urgent contemporary crises, in Europe as much as globally. It is also well established that free-ranging domestic cats pose a significant threat to European biodiversity. Stray and feral cats are to be removed or controlled when they pose a threat to protected species and/or sites. Regarding pet and farm cats, the Nature Directives require EU Member States to ensure that letting them roam free is forbidden and effectively prevented.”  >>  Arie Trouwborst, Han Somsen, Domestic Cats (Felis catus) and European Nature Conservation Law—Applying the EU Birds and Habitats Directives to a Significant but Neglected Threat to Wildlife, Journal of Environmental Law, , eqz035, https://doi.org/10.1093/jel/eqz035 It sounds plausible but is it true? According to the Dutch bureau of the European Commission it is not. The bureau posted the following statement on Twitter: “We are not going to ask cat-owners to keep their cats on a leash. According to our information cats are not the biggest threat to #biodiversity.”   IMAGE: screenshot taken on 15 January 2020, from the Twitter account of Europa in Nederland (the Dutch Bureau of the European Commission), in response to a news article from NOS (the Dutch public broadcaster.   In combination with data on the, according to them, catastrophic effect that pet cats have on wildlife Trouwborst and Somsen mainly based their conclusion on two articles of law. The first is the 2009 Birds Directive and the second is the 1997 Habitat Directive.  The Birds Directive states: “Member States shall take the requisite measures to maintain the population of the species referred to in Article 1 at a level which corresponds in particular to ecological, scientific and cultural requirements, while taking account of economic and recreational requirements, or to adapt the population of these species to that level.” The Habitat Directive states: “Ensure that the deliberate introduction into the wild of any species which is not native to their territory is regulated so as not to prejudice natural habitats within their natural range or the wild native fauna and flora and, if they consider it necessary, prohibit such introduction. The results of the assessment undertaken shall be forwarded to the committee for information.” CONCLUSIONAccording to the researchers’ interpretation of the Directives mentioned above, because cats are not native to Europe and they cause a lot of harm to environment they should either be removed or controlled when roaming outside. However, the articles taken from the Habitat and Bird directive can be interpreted in several ways. The European Commission does not agree with the conclusion made by the two law researchers. The way to interpret these articles is up for debate which makes the claim uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

Facebook post by Silvia Sardone https://www.facebook.com/silviasardone/ Lega (League), Sardone’s party, frequently claims Italian public services and welfare initiatives tend to assist immigrants more than Italians. This statement, hence, perfectly matches the party’s position, which can be summed up with Lega’s motto “Italians first”. In an assembly of the Municipality of Milan, then, she enriched her claim by quoting two different documents. According to Sardone, in one measure the Municipality of Milan enacted, called “misura 1”, 90% of the income support annuitants are foreigners, while in another measure, named “misura 2”, only one out of four is Italian. What is the income support? The Municipality of Milan offers an income support to those who don’t possess the requirements to benefit from the “basic income”. This support can reach a maximum of 2.000 euros, divided in two tranches (1.000 euros and another 1.000 euros after 6 months). Who can receive it? Italians and foreigners who: Have been living in Milan for a minimum of 1 year;Possess less than 6.000 € ISEE (ISEE is a financial instrument that measures the annual income of the entire family nucleus. Literally, ISEE is the equivalent economic status indicator);Don’t receive other forms of support from social policies or other national measures, such as the “basic income”. Verifying the claim How did Sardone obtain the data about these two income support measures? She asked Gabriele Rabaiotti, social policies assessor of the Municipality of Milan, to send her information on this. On 12th December 2019, Rabaiotti’s office provided her with some documents containing the sheer numbers of the adopted and discarded families.  In order to grant privacy each applicant’s name, surname and tax number were written incompletely: this way, it is impossible to discover the exact identity of people applying for the two income support measures, and to establish for sure whether they are Italians or foreigners. The Municipality, however, included in their documents a statistic concerning the proportion of Italians and non-Italians among the eligible ones.  “Misura 1” Proportion of accepted and rejected applications.  https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1274212/ “Misura 2” Proportion of accepted and rejected applications. https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1272680/ Total of “Misura1” and “Misura 2” proportion of accepted and rejected applications. https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1274404/ As it is possible to observe in the first graph, the document related to “misura 1” outlines an amount of 770 admitted candidates, 692 (90%) of which are told to be foreigners and only 78 (10%) Italians. In the document referring to “misura 2”, instead, on a total of 127 admissions, 95 candidates are foreigners and 32 are Italians, showing a three on one ratio. Discriminative intent The percentage of foreigners who receive income support in Milan used by Silvia Sardone are true. However, these documents indicate the total number of applicants and the amount of the discarded ones (814 and 44 in the first case, 141 and 14 in the second case) without specifying the amount of Italians and foreigners among these 44 and 14 non-admitted applicants. This lack of information makes Sardone’s claim controversial, as she stated the Municipality of Milan discriminates Italians, but she didn’t have the tools to know the exact proportion of Italians and foreigners among the non-admitted ones.  Even if she possessed all the data which the Municipality provided us, which include the percentages of the non-admitted ones, it is still not possible to assert there was a discriminative intent, as it is impossible to know the exact amount of people who potentially need income support (since the aid is based on volunteer enrolment, not even the Municipality knows it). In short, based upon the number provided to us by the Municipality of Milan, we decide that Silvia Sardone’s claim is mostly true.  Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

In the article, Flemish Minister of Welfare Wouter Beke (CD&V) gives some numbers on the retroactive receipt of child allowance. Is the number correct and used in the right context? De Morgen and Wouter Beke (CD&V) do not mention the source of the numbers about the retroactive receipt of child allowance. De Morgen writes only that the numbers are provisional data collected over the last five years.   Image: a screenshot from the article in daily newspaper De Morgen, published on 7 January 2020 Context A committee meeting on Welfare, Public Health, Family and Poverty Reduction on 7 January 2020 mentions the amount of 90.000 euros as it is discussed between different politicians.  The Flemish Minister Wouter Beke released the numbers following a statement by the Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon (N-VA). The latter claimed that he had heard a story about a family that was able to buy a house from the child allowance they received retroactively (afterwards). Jambon denounced the system whereby asylum seekers can collect the overdue children allowance when they are recognized as refugees. Several ministers reacted harshly to his statement, such as the chairwoman of Open VLD Gwendolyn Rutten. Beke claimed that the families who received retroactively so much money were not mainly asylum seekers. According to a statement by the Minister of Welfare, De Morgen journalist Roel Wauters writes that also in other cases children allowance only can be paid out afterwards. It concerns, for example, a family that (temporarily) resided in another European member state and it took a while before these data were reconciled. Also, in families with children with disabilities children allowance can be paid out later due to administrative delays.  Beke was contacted by e-mail on Monday 13 January and his  family policy adviser David Vits responded on Sunday 19 January. The e-mail states: “at the request of Beke the figures were provided in mutual coordination by an externally autonomous agency of the Flemish government designed under public law.” Because of a change within the Family Policy system (there have been mergers and now a new benefit act, as explained below) the websites of the organisations are not yet updated. Vits in his e-mail mentions ‘Opgroeien’ in which many organisations are merged but the website is not yet updated and states that figures will be available soon. Old general child benefit act In the meantime, this is no longer possible. Since the introduction of the new child benefit, the growth package, a family must have a residence card in order to be eligible for child benefit. The new Flemish government now wants to take a quick decision to no longer pay child benefit for the period of the asylum procedure, because asylum seekers will then already be entitled to material support. The example cited by Minister Beke is therefore only possible in the former federal legislation. It was in fact a federal competence until 1 September 2019.On the website of vlaanderen.be you can see that a lot has changed in the General Child Benefit Act.   Under the old General Child Benefit Act scheme, asylum seekers could receive child benefit retroactively for the entire period of their recognition procedure, from the moment of the application to the moment of recognition.The amount of child benefit the asylum seeker receives retroactively therefore depends on the duration of his recognition procedure. The website of the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS) aims that they take a decision within 2 months. If this does not succeed, the asylum procedure may take several months. At the beginning of 2018, however, there were 584 asylum seekers who would wait 5 years for their decision.  But the Act also states that the right to child benefit expires within a period of five years. So, asylum seekers can get their child benefit for a maximum of five years. Yves Coemans of the Gezinsbond also states that it’s a theoretical maximum scenario, because decisions usually do not take that long. “If an asylum seeker receives a refusal, it is in principle not the intention that he would receive child benefit until the date of his first application. At least that is the view of the Dutch-speaking judges. French-speaking judges, on the other hand, would be more flexible in dealing with these regulations and would rather go back to the original application date”. On top of that, you have to work another four years to receive the money retroactively. Vague answer Nobody knows exactly where the numbers that Minister Beke quoted in the Flemish Parliament come from. “It’s difficult to calculate Minister Beke’s numerical example exactly. After all, he’s talking about a family of an asylum seeker who has more than three children. He doesn’t mention the exact number”, says Yves Coemans of the Gezinsbond. Yves Coemans gives us an example where a family of asylum seekers could receive a maximum of 87,375 euros under the old legislation. In this example he speaks of five children older than 18 years. This age category is the category in which the parents receive the most child money.  In short, it is almost impossible for a family of asylum seekers to receive such a large sum of money. But since we don’t know exactly where  Minister Wouter Beke got the numbers from, it’s difficult to say whether he’s right or not. It’s also true that every case in Belgium is handled differently, every family of asylum seekers is different. So, the other numbers may certainly be correct. He also emphasises that they are essentially not asylum seekers. But unfortunately, we are not sure about any of the numbers, possibly until Beke responds to our e-mail.

The claim is highlighted in the title of the article, labelled as an ”exclusive“. Investigative journalist Andrej Dimitrijević writes about the allocation of funds from the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds, saying that the ministry regularly invites tenders under the Community Investment Program project.  Although the public call for expressions of interest for co-financing says that applicants may be non-profit organizations in the field of health, education, culture and social welfare, religious communities and owners of public buildings; according to Telegram, money is almost exclusively given to parishes.            Money goes to the most powerful institution in Croatia? We have researched in more detail the truthfulness of the claim in the title of the article that points to the fact that on the annual Government contest for local community development the Church always wins. According to information found on the website of the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds published by Telegram.hr,  in the last two contests (in years 2017 and 2018) almost all the money was allocated to religious communities, especially to the Catholic Church, known for its concordance with the political right-wing, including center-right party HDZ which is currently in power. Support for non-Church organizations is like a needle in a haystack  In year 2017 almost 1 million Euros (7.074.000 HRK) was distributed to different local projects from the Community Investment Program. The committee approved 36 projects out of which 35 of them, which include repairs of the churches, church grounds and interiors, were proposed by the biggest religious organization in Croatia – the Catholic Church. These projects claimed more than 917.000 Euro (774.000 HRK) which amounts to 97% of the amount of money approved. On the other side, the only non-Church organization which received funds was the City Museum of Karlovac which got merely 45.000 Euro (300.000 HRK) for reconstruction and conversion of an old military complex into the Museum of Army Collections from the Croatian Homeland War. However, in year 2018 the Church won all the money from the same program. That year the projects proposed by the Church received more than 1,5 million Euro (11 368 000 HRK) for the renovation of numerous chapels and mission houses, for the renovation of dilapidated floors, for the repairment of towers and confessionals, as well as for the reconstruction of roofs and the installation of underfloor heating. In other words, other projects that include the core objective of strengthening social cohesion and investing in public institutions for this purpose have not received a cent in 2018. Hence, the very title of Telegram’s article saying that the Church always wins the competition, according to the research, is correct, with one exception. Therefore, because of that one project in year 2017, we assess that the claim was mostly true, even though it is possible that the journalist based his claim on solely the funds allocated in year 2018.

This news was written using research from consumer collective United Consumers.  IMAGE: screenshot, taken on 16 January 2020, from the news article in De Telegraaf with the claim that the Dutch pay the most for Euro 95 petrol CLAIMIs Telegraaf correct by claiming that in the Netherlands you pay the highest amount of money for Euro 95 petrol in Europe? Who wrote what?The news was written in De Telegraaf, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the Netherlands. They represent the voice of the ordinary Dutch men, who is so often mentioned but rarely heard. Mariëtte Wolf, who was awarded her doctoral degree with a thesis on the history of De Telegraaf, states that the newspaper is always in search for noise and makes as much news as possible. The journalistic style is according to her very progressive in terms of choice, subject and layout.  However, De Telegraaf used United Consumers research as their primary source. This is a Dutch consumer collective for individuals. With the collective they can offer their consumers benefits on e.g. health insurance, car insurance, energy and petrol. Every day United Consumers calculates the average national recommended price for one litre of different kinds of petrol. They calculate this on the basis of the suggested retail prices from the five biggest oil concerns in the Netherlands; Shell, BP, Total, Texaco and Esso.   What about the price? Recommended & averageIn the article from De Telegraaf it’s written that the national recommended price for one litre of Euro 95 was €1,83 at that moment. Although, the national recommended price is not the same as the average price for petrol. The national recommended price is an indication of the petrol price in a country, petrol stations are free to adjust the price. The Statistics Bureau of the Netherlands (CBS) provides current and reliable statistical information of the average petrol prices in the Netherlands.  On January 7 the average petrol price for a litre of Euro 95 was, according to, CBS €1,717. In the weekly oil bulletin from the European Commission the average price for one litre of Euro 95 in the Netherlands was €1,716. Buckle up!But is that the highest price in Europe? In the weekly oil bulletin, all the average prices for one litre of Euro 95 in EU member states are available. And yes, the Netherlands is the most expensive country for petrol in the European Union. Second up is Denmark with an average of €1,67 and on the bottom of the list is Romania with €1,09.    IMAGE: this map shows consumer prices of Euro 95 in Europe on 6 January 2020 and is available for download here. However, De Telegraaf is talking about Europe. When researching the petrol prices all over Europe, the best way to compare prices is to use the national recommended price from each country. This is the price that United Consumers used as well. The Royal Dutch Touring Club (ANWB) has made a list of the national recommended prices in Europe for one litre of Euro 95. In their list the price is €1,82 – one cent less than United Consumers, but even so the Netherlands has the highest price on the list.

The claims turns out to be true. 14.10.2019 – RT reports, that the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court of Spain has passed judgement on the case 20907/2017 of 13.10.2019 upon 12 Catalonian politicians, who are accused of holding the illegal referendum on the independence of Catalonia and declaring independence through the local parliament in 2017 within the separatist process. In order to check on the truthfulness of RT’s report we aidlessly found the original source of information, which is the official Web site of the Supreme Court of Spain. In the section called “Noticias Judiciales” (Judicial news) we found the requiered information regarding the case of the accused Catalonian politicians.

107,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-only-politically-conservative-croatian-women-are-successful/,Only politically conservative Croatian women are successful,2019-12-11,eufactcheck,,"At the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Croatian centre-right party HDZ  (Croatian Democratic Union) Women’s Association, Croatian President Mrs Kolinda Grabar Kitarović said that all successful Croatian women are both conservative and members of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). The claim turns out to be false. The Croatian Democratic Union is currently the biggest conservative political party in the country, holding the majority in the Croatian Parliament. The elected President Kolinda Grabar Kitarović was a candidate from this party. At the previously mentioned celebration in November 2019, the President was invited as a guest of honour.  In the speech she said: “In fact, Croatian women who are successful and who have gained international recognition – such as Marija Pejčinović Burić, Dubravka Šuica, Ivana Maletić, including myself in my previous career when I was in NATO – interestingly, all of them are members of the HDZ party. All of them are conservative.”   For background, Mrs Pejčinović Burić is the present Secretary General of the Council of Europe, while Mrs Šuica and Mrs Maletić are members of the European Parliament. All three are appointed to their positions being representatives of the HDZ, party which belongs to the majority group in the European Parliament – EPP. Network Kitarović’s statement did not go unnoticed in the Croatian media. We decided to check the validity of President’s statement.  First, many Croatian women who are active politicians are not members of the HDZ party, and even more of them do not share conservative beliefs. The person who individually won the highest number of votes in the recent European elections, Mrs Ruža Tomašić, is conservative, but she is not (and never was) member of the mentioned party. Furthermore, Mrs Biljana Borzan, who was chosen for the second time as a Croatian member of the European Parliament, is member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (centre-left political position).  More important, it is easy to identify Croatian women who have received international recognition for professional success outside politics. Mrs Caroline Spivak, founder of Croatian Women’s Network, said: “It is true what the President said that the three women she mentioned are HDZ members. However, if you look at the broader context, it is also true that many successful Croatian women can be found in various areas of social life – in every profession, but also in every political party, both conservative and not conservative.”  Each year the Network honours successful Croatian women who live either in Croatia or abroad, and who have made a difference in Croatian society or in communities of Croatians abroad. For example, as part of Croatian Women of Influence Award 2020, the chosen women are artists, businesswomen, scientists or sportswomen. Target audience That being said, the real questions that remain open are: Is there any real correlation between being successful and being conservative? What does it mean to be successful anyway? Mrs Ivana Radić, president of the International women’s business network commented: “I think that to be successful, being conservative or liberal is not crucial. For example, business has no borders and is built where there is interest and necessity for it. I think that the President’s statement is personal, or perhaps she moves mostly in conservative circles so that is her perception. But different individuals have different wishes and perceive success differently.” Dr Brigita Miloš from the Croatian Centre for Women’s Studies at the University of Rijeka said that this statement is typical conservative rhetoric. “All attributions that conservativism traditionally correlates with femininity are, in this concrete case, also connected with career self-realisation. Also, conservative politics, in particular, is rarely in agreement with the idea of complete gender equality or the idea of women emancipation”, added Dr Miloš.  In conclusion, the President’s statement was suitable for the occasion, but it was not based on truth or facts, but either a personal perception of success or part of a speech modelled for a specific target audience –female members of the HDZ party.

As of January 1st 2020 the packaging of cigarettes will be neutral in Belgium. The country will be the fifth in Europe that follows the trend of making its tobacco packaging neutral after France, Norway, UK and Ireland. It hereby follows the guidelines created for trying to make Europe a smoke free continent in order to keep their citizens healthy. Susceptible brains In september CIMABEL claimed that there is no scientific study that investigates if people will smoke less due to neutral packaging. However, the University of Antwerp already studied the question in 2012 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2016. The results of the study were that plain packages are perceived as cheap, unreliable and less attractive for young people. Because of the unattractiveness of the plain packaging, the health warnings catch the eye much more strongly. The study, the first in Flanders on this topic, concludes that plain packaging could be a strong policy tool to reduce the number of adolescents that start smoking. The reason the plain packaging is mostly focused on changing the behaviour of the youth is the same reason that cigarette manufacturers target this group with their advertising. The brains of young people are more susceptible to nicotine in tobacco, which makes them more likely to get addicted. They also are more likely to be influenced by logos and colours on the packaging. Pubs shutting down CIMABEL wants to hold back measures against tobacco products by posting these claims on their website and social media. It is no coincidence that the cigarette manufacturers make this claim at this time, as the arrival of the neutral packaging is coming closer and will inevitably hurt their revenue.  Tobacco lobbyists are known for making false claims about the effect of measures against tobacco products. When European countries prohibited smoking in pubs around 2010 the lobby claimed that a lot of pubs would go out of business. However, after the measure was implemented there was no increase in pubs shutting down. In short, the claim from CIMABEL about the non-existence of a study about plain packaging is false, as the University of Antwerp and the World Health Organisation already intensively studied the case.

The false AfD-claim refers to an article on the web portal of the German newscast Tagesschau.  The AfD quoted Tagesschau wrongly: while the Tagesschau reported that every third immigrant and asylum seeker had arrived in Italy via the eastern route according to UNHCR , the refugee agency of the United Nations, it did not claim that every third had arrived on a yacht. Although the Tagesschau-article addresses the issue that refugees would indeed arrive on yachts, it did not provide data on the amount of arrivals on yachts. The reason: the data is not gathered by any organization as our research shows.  AfD-Facebook-posting, August  9th, 2019: “Now they arrive on a yacht!” The UNHCR defines the eastern oversea route by boats departing from Greece and Turkey and arriving in Italy (mostly in the states Apulia, Calabria and Basilicata). Almost one third took this route in the first seven months of 2019. Therefore, the quote by Tagesschau is true, which this factsheet by UNHCR proves. To be precise: exactly 31.39 percent of all overseas arrivals used this route. If the AfD-claim would be true, all of them would have had to use yachts. It is however true that yachts are used by smugglers for overseas transport. Yet, a speaker of UNHCR stresses that this phenomenon is not new. Although the journey would be less dangerous than on rubber dinghies, it is still “often desperate and dangerous” and not “rather comfortably” as the AfD post also states.  Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, could not provide us with data on the types of boats arriving as many of them are not even tracked. Although Frontex categorizes arrivals by boat types (like motor and sailing boats), they do not have an extra category for yachts. In short, the AfD-claim is false. The AfD did not react to our query asking about their source as of November 22th, 2019.","https://www.facebook.com/alternativefuerde/posts/2571105599586430,https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/italien-apulien-schlepper-101.html,https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/70741,https://www.instagram.com/",Every 3rd refugee reaches Italy on a yacht on the eastern route,,,,,,
110,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-upcoming-eu-elections-are-a-referendum-on-abortion/,The upcoming EU elections are “a referendum on abortion”,2019-05-27,eufactcheck,,"On the 12th of May 2019, Maltese leader of the Nationalist Party, Adrian Delia, stated in Times of Malta that the upcoming European elections are “a referendum on abortion.” He continues that every seat going to the Labour Party would be a seat in the European Parliament in favour of abortion. Malta is the only country in the European Union where abortion is not allowed under all circumstances.  For the small Mediterranean island between Europe and Africa with its overall catholic society, abortion is an unspoken topic. Moreover, in case of an abortion either the medical performer or the consenting person could risk jail time up to four years. Manifesto of Party of European Socialists In his statement, Delia says that a seat for the Labour Party is one in favour of abortion. And there is a reason why he makes this connection.  In the Maltese parliament, the Labour Party (red) has the majority of the seats. Other parties are the Nationalistic Party (blue) and the Democratic Party (yellow). Visual © United Union – Wikimedia Commons The Labour Party, Malta’s largest party in the government, is part of the political group Party of European Socialists (PES) in the European Parliament. They’ve published a manifesto in the beginning of March 2019 for the forthcoming EU elections. It is written in there that they aim to “ensure that every individual has access to their full sexual and reproductive rights” and that “every person has the right to decide over their own body”.  Sexual and reproductive rights (SRR) entitles the right to make your own decision on sexual and reproductive health. One of the things that it includes it to determine the number, timing and spacing of their children. Sexual and reproductive health is on one side the capability to have a “safe and satisfying sex life” and on the other side “the ability to reproduce”. Source: European Humanist Federation  A bit controversial for the Maltese member party. The Labour party does claim they’ll maintain their party line with regards to these SRR and Maltese MEP of the Labour Party Alfred Sant also said that “abortion is in no way part of the programme of Malta’s Labour government”. It looks like that the views of the PES are different from its Maltese member party. Therefore, it does not directly mean that every seat for the Labour Party is one in favour of abortion. There is, however, more to this story that it first seems. Malta as part of the EU In May 2004, Malta became an EU member state, in response to a referendum held in March 2003. Malta’s two major parties, the Labour and Nationalistic Party had different views on Malta’s accession. While the Nationalistic Party wanted to become an EU member state, the Labour Party only wanted to establish a partnership with the EU.  Referendum Malta for accession into the EU Infogram With a turnout of 91%, a small majority of the Maltese people agreed that Malta should become an EU member state. The numbers have been rounded up. Graph © Suzanna Demey Labour leader Alfred Sant was, however, not convinced with this small majority. He wanted to make the upcoming general election the definite decider. His party’s ultimate loss in these elections led the way for Malta to the EU. One of the condition for Malta to join the Union was that the EU would never be able to force the legalisation of abortion upon Malta. Therefore, the statement made by Delia is incorrect. Terminology At last, Delia uses the word ‘referendum’. To know what a referendum and election actually entails, we looked up their definition in the Cambridge Dictionary. A referendum is a vote in which all the people in a country or an area are asked to give their opinion about or decide an important political or social question. An election is a time when people vote in order to choose someone for a political or official job. In short, the similarity in these two terms is that people are being asked to cast a vote, but while a referendum is to decide something, an election is to choose someone. In this case to represent Malta in the European Parliament. Therefore, the word “referendum” shouldn’t be used in this context. Conclusion Although the Labour Party is part of a European group who strives for full SRR, abortion in Malta can never be decided by the EU. Moreover, the EU elections are not a referendum.

111,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-increased-homophobia-in-the-netherlands-is-caused-by-uncontrolled-immigration-and-open-borders-2/,“The increased homophobia in The Netherlands is caused by uncontrolled immigration and open borders”,2019-05-26,eufactcheck,,"AWAITING ELECTION RESULTS WE REPOST OUR MOST QUOTED FACT-CHECK On March the 4th Dutch leader of the right-wing Forum for Democracy Thierry Baudet reacted to a statement by liberal politician Rob Jetten about homophobia in The Netherlands. Baudet stated on Twitter: ,,Jetten’s anger about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is justified, but he doesn’t see the causes: the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders his own political party D66 in particular stands for.” His claim about the causes for the increased homophobia is false.  In this fact-check we focus on the statement that ‘the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders’ are the causes of the ‘increased’ homo-hate crimes in The Netherlands. It is important to notice that Baudet doesn’t speak of any specific time or place. This is why we assume that he is talking about the general situation in The Netherlands in recent years.  Tweet by Thierry Baudet Baudet reacted to quotes in a lecture by his fellow Member of Parliament Rob Jetten, as reported by national public broadcaster NOS on 4 March. Jetten voiced concern about the emancipation of the LGBTQ-community in the Netherlands. He didn’t mention any increase of homophobia.  Because Baudet’s statement isn’t specified, checking it is difficult. To still be able to check his statement, we used several research reports about the nationality and ethnicity of suspects of homophobic crimes. Besides that, we also checked whether or not homophobia in The Netherlands has really increased.  The Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP) published a LGBTQ-study in November 2018. This study mainly concentrates on the living conditions of homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people in The Netherlands. An important statement reads: ,,Recent studies indicate that the attitude towards LGBTQ-people has become more positive between 2006/2007 and 2016/2017 (Kuyper 2018).” For this, the SCP used data of the Safety Monitor that is published by the Central Bureau of Statistics.  Besides LGBTQ-people feeling more safe throughout the years, they also mentioned having less experiences with homo-hate crimes. To conclude: the statement about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is generally untrue. Bisexuals did mention a slight increase in experiences with homophobic crimes, but Baudet did not specify that. The LGBTQ-study doesn’t mention the ethnicity and social factors of the culprits. The organization MenEngage Europe does mention it in its factsheet about homophobia: ,,Those who are negative about homosexuality are mostly the elderly, the young, religious people and people from ethnical minority groups.” In 2015, the Dutch police published a study about homophobic crimes in The Netherlands. A notable fact: about 60 percent of the reported incidents took place in Amsterdam. The study doesn’t differentiate between non-immigrants and immigrants, but it does look at the nationality and birth country of the suspects. This study proves that 61.8 percent of the suspects has the Dutch nationality. To quote the study: ,,In 16.6 percent of the cases the suspect has the Moroccan nationality (possibly combined with the Dutch nationality). Besides that, 5.5 percent of the suspects has the Turkish nationality and 2.5 percent has the Romanian nationality. The nationalities that are even less frequent aren’t specified. In 11.5 percent of the cases it concerns a nationality that occurs less than four times.” In conclusion: the uncontrolled immigration and open borders are not the main causes of homophobia in The Netherlands. A different study from The Netherlands Institute for Social Research mentions the following: ,,The acceptance of homosexuality can be a sensitive subject for Syrians: less than a fifth fully or partly agrees with gay marriage. About half fully or partly agrees that the homosexuality of a child is problematic.” The study does prove that Syrians who have been in The Netherlands for a longer time have a more open attitude towards homosexuality.  Laurens Buijs from the University of Amsterdam published a study about the same subject in 2009. He proves that 36 percent of the suspects is of Dutch descent and that another 36 percent of the suspects is of Moroccan descent. This study shows that suspects of homo-hate crimes are just as much of Dutch descent as of Moroccan descent. To conclude: homophobic crimes aren’t caused anymore by ethnical minority groups than by people with the Dutch nationality.  Thierry Baudet’s statement about the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders as the cause of the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is false. This is mainly so because homophobia in The Netherlands hasn’t increased at all. Besides that, the studies above prove that the suspects of homophobic hate crimes are mostly people with the Dutch nationality.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

This is mostly true.  Did Berlusconi’s work really get to minimize this parameter? It must be pointed out that it’s hard to associate a certain tax burden to a government or another. Indeed, some political decisions have a delayed effect. In this case, taking into consideration each Italian government in charge from 1999 to 2019, the claim turns out to be true: under Berlusconi’s second government, in 2005, Italy reached the 39% rate. Something that you couldn’t find until 2005 neither from 2006 until 2019. However, what Forza Italia’s leader stated is relatively true because – even if the lowest tax to Gdp ratio has to be considered his own achievement – it didn’t last for the whole period when Berlusconi was in charge. Considering the data from the Ministry of Economy and Finance about 2018-19, by ISTAT (we’re talking about reports referred to 1999-2013, 2013-2015, 2016-2017) and by CGIA office in Mestre (page 6), we can notice that, during the second and third Berlusconi’s government (in charge from June 2001 to May 2006), tax to Gdp ratio regularly swang between 39.3% and 40.2%, decreasing to 39.1% just in 2005. A situation that can’t be found in the 4th Berlusconi’s government (in charge from May 2008 to November 2011): back then, tax to Gdp ratio swang between 41.3% and 41.6%. Even if it’s not that huge, there’s still a growth.  Conclusion Therefore, looking at the comparisons between the figures, Berlusconi’s statement can be considered mostly true, because the minimum tax burden rate in the last 20 years has been reached under one of his governments (in 2005), while in the years 2006-2007, when Prodi cabinet was in charge, the rate went from 40.2% to 41.5%, in 2012-2013 (Monti and Letta cabinets) it reached 43.6%, from 2014 to 2017 (Renzi and Gentiloni cabinets) it swang from 43.3% to 42.2%; and finally, in 2018-2019, under Conte cabinet, tax burden rate was between 41.9% and 42.3%. That figure, anyway, cannot be considered a constant of each and every one of Berlusconi’s governments, just like he meant to say during his interview on Italian television on May 21st.

Second, that unemployment has fallen 0.4 points. Third, that unemployment among young people is the lowest in Italy since 2011, and fourth, that Italy’s GDP data shows the country is ‘starting up again’.  Employment rates are the highest since April 2008 The employment rate is the ratio between the total population of working age and the population in employment. Population of working age is something Eurostat defines as people in the age range 20-64. According to statistics from Eurostat, we can see that employment rates have been steadily increasing since 2000, reaching a small peak of 62,9 percent in 2008. After this peak, the employment rates dropped the years after the financial crisis. In 2013, the employment rates started to rise again reaching a new peak level 2018 of 63 percent. This makes this first part of Danilo Toninelli’s statement true   Source for both figures: Eurostat   Worth noting is that the EU average of employment rate lies at 73,2 percent, meaning that Italy is still far behind other member states. The only country with a current employment rate lower than Italy’s is Greece with 59,5 percent. Unemployment Falling 0.4 points This is hard to fact check, as Toninelli does not give a time frame in this claim. In the last month, unemployment in Italy has fallen 0.3 points, but over the past six months, the rate has fallen 0.4 points. This statistic is slightly misleading on its own, as six months ago, in October 2018, unemployment spiked 0.3 from the month before. If Toninelli is looking at a six month period, then this part of his claim is TRUE. Youth unemployment lowest since 2011 Toninelli tweets specifically about youth unemployment and how this has been as its lowest since 2011. As the United Nations agreed for statistical consistency, youth is defined as the people between the ages of 15-24. This is also what Eurostat defines as a youth. According to Eurostat, the youth unemployment (people with less than 25 years of age) is in fact at its lowest since 2011 in Italy. At that point, youth unemployment rates lied at 29,2 percent. Since 2011, youth unemployment steadily rose until reaching a peak in 2014 at around 43 percent. Since then, the youth unemployment has steadily declined and is currently at a rate of 30,2 percent (according to Istat, the Italian National Institute of Statistic).   Source for both figures: Young.Stat Nonetheless, this is still a higher youth unemployment rate than what was displayed before 2011. In 2007 Italy displayed youth unemployment rates of around 20 percent. Hence, the choice of 2011 as a reference point might be questionable. The statement in the tweet is however true. Italy still has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the EU, with only Spain and Greece displaying higher numbers. PIL (Prodotto Interno Lordo) otherwise known as GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Gross Domestic Product refers to the total value of everything produced in the country, in a given period. It doesn’t matter if the producers are citizens or foreigners, as long as it’s produced in the country. According to the Italian Institute of Statistic the GDP has increased by 0.2 percent in comparison to the previous quarter and by 0.1 per cent over the same quarter of previous year. With quarter we refer to a three month period that is used in financial activities. Quarter refers to one-fourth of a year, meaning: ➔ 1st Quarter: January, February, March ➔ 2nd Quarter: April, May, June ➔ 3rd Quarter: July, August, September ➔ 4th Quarter: October, November, December For the moment, the annual GDP growth for 2019 is equal to 0.1%. We can see there is a small growth in the GDP. Therefore, the claim in itself is true. However, this minor change in GDP can be defined as too small to actually call it a growing trend. One could argue that the growth must grow to a larger extent and persist over a longer period of time in order to be defined as true growth, and much more to actually prove that the country is starting up again. Conclusion We can conclude that the choices of reference years in the first and third part of the claim are quite misleading. Both the years 2008 and 2011 have been chosen to support Toninelli’s point that the country is in fact starting up again. If other years would have been chosen, this trend could in fact be disproven. The second part of the claim is true if you look at the most recent numbers, but there is no reference to a period of time in the claim, making it highly questionable. In the fourth part of the tweet, the actual GDP growth might be too small to actually determine that the country is starting up again. In isolation, each of the individual claims and statistics in the tweet by Italian minister Danilo Toninelli are true. But the choice of reference points in these statistics make them questionable. Therefore, we have chosen to define the claim as mostly true.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below. Take note: your response is moderated.

On March 2017 the University of Amsterdam published a report in which ‘flexible labour market’ is given an understandable definition: ‘’Flexible work includes all types of (paid) work that are not carried out in a permanent employment with a fixed working hours’’. The Netherlands vs Europe Even though the earlier named report gives a clear definition, there is still a difference between the Netherlands and other European countries. On 25 April 2019 the Central Bureau for the Statics (CBS), published their research about the flexible labour market in the Netherlands and Europe. This shows that the definition of a flexible labour market in the Netherlands may differ with the definition in other European countries: ‘’The difference is that the EU only looks at the contract. In the Netherlands both the contract and the contract hours are important.’’ This is why the EU-number in the Netherlands is lower than the CBS-number in the figures below. In the Eurostat figures for 2015 the Netherlands is ranked sixth. Flex workers in the EU. Source: CBS, 2017 By using the Dutch definition, the CBS comes to the conclusion that in 2017 the Netherlands were the fourth country to have the most flexible labour market. Only Poland, Spain and Greece were ranked higher. Despite being in fourth place, the Netherlands is the fastest growing country on the flexible labour market. The figure below shows that the Netherlands were between 2007 and 2017 the fastest growing country and that Poland and Spain even sank on the flexible labour market.  Growth in amount of flex workers in the EU. Source: CBS, 2017 Most flexible or not? Following the research from the CBS, The Netherlands does not have the most flexible labour market in Europe, but the country is the fastest grower. The European countries with a bigger flexible labour market are even dropping on the flexible labour market index, whereby the Netherlands is likely to have the most flexible labour market in the future, provided that such growth persists.

On May 3, 2019,  “RIA Novosti” published an article, telling about reduction of voter interest in EP elections – a decrease in turnout. It reports that according to data provided by the European Parliament, which was analyzed by journalist of RIA Novosti, at the first elections to the European Assembly, which were held in 1979, the voter turnout of 9 member – countries of Union was 61.9%. In the second election held in 1989, with an increase in the number of participating states up to 12, turnout fell to 58.98%.  The publication reports that the activity of voters continued to fall steadily. For example, in the elections to the EP in 1999 with 15 EU members (49.51%), and in 2004 in the format of 25 community states (45.47%), as well as in 2007, when the EU expanded to 27 participants (42 , 97%). At the last elections of MEP’s in 2014, the voter turnout index in 28 EU countries dropped to 42.61% . The source to which the author refers was presented by the European Parliament review. In order to check the statement in the Russian material, we turned to the official website of the European Parliament and found a document (Review), which presents the results of a survey on voter turnout. On page 50, we found a table with data on the overall turnout at the European Parliament elections, starting in 1979. The data presented in the European Parliamentary Election Report indicate, that the information published on the “RIA Novisti” Internet portal is true and coincides with the figures presented. Thus, after analyzing the data of the Russian portal “RIA Novisti” and the data presented at the EP official website, we conclude that, indeed, voter turnout in the elections to the European Parliament (EP) has steadily decreased since the late 1970s, therefore, this information is true.

If and when this becomes reality, fast alternatives are important. According to Esther de Lange, member of the European Parliament for the Christian democrats, alternatives are still not fast enough to be an option. She said: ‘The travel time from The Netherlands to Berlin by train is as long as twenty years ago.’ It is not.  Berlin main railway station today. ©WTFact A direct train connection  between Amsterdam and Berlin was already in place in 1999. At that time the train stopped at three railway stations in The Netherlands and eight railway stations in Germany (among others: Osnabruck, Hanover and Magdeburg). The fastest connection departed three times a day, according to this old-fashioned journey planner. From the last railway station in the Netherlands, Hengelo, the travel time was five and a half hours. Nowadays the direct train between Amsterdam and Berlin departs seven times a day. The train stops at seven railways stations in The Netherlands. In Germany the train stops only in Bad Bentheim, Osnabruck and Hannover. So in Germany the number of stops has decreased from eight to three, resulting in a shorter travel time from Hengelo to Berlin by one hour. The travel time for a direct connection is now four and a half hour. Within twenty years the fastest journey from the border of the Netherlands to Berlin is reduced by one hour. That means an improvement of eighteen percent.   Conclusion The claim made by De Lange: “The travel time from The Netherlands to Berlin by train is as long as twenty years ago” is false.

117,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-five-thousand-professions-are-regulated-in-europe/,‘Five thousand professions are regulated in Europe’,2019-05-20,eufactcheck,,"This claim has been made in several Dutch election programs for the upcoming European elections. The problem boils down to the definition of a profession, but we rate the claim as mostly false.    The People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) claims (page 17) that ‘there are currently 5,000 regulated professions in Europe, from archivist to fireworks expert’, and uses the number as an argument for streamlining cross-border work: ‘This creates barriers for working and providing services abroad.’   Other parties 50PLUS, another Dutch party, uses the same number for the same argument (chapter 3). ‘There are still 5,000 regulated professions in the EU. […] Every small business owner in Europe should be able to sell his goods on the internet to other EU-countries without administrative barriers.’ It’s notable that both ‘the EU’ and ‘Europe’ are used for the same statistic, although it is not uncommon for politicians to use both terms to address the European Union. Finally, democrat party D66 also mentions the importance of ‘reducing the number of regulated professions for non-residents’, but does not include a statistic.   What is a regulated profession? Clearly, the topic of regulated professions is popular for the upcoming elections. But where does the statistic come from, and is it correct? To begin with, we need a clear definition of what a regulated profession is. The term is defined on this EU website as follows: ‘As a general rule, a profession is regulated if you have to hold a specific degree to access the profession, sit special exams such as state exams and/or register with a professional body before you can practice it.’ These rules are created by member states (not the EU) and differ across Europe, which could make it harder to practice a job in another country.   Database The European Commission itself uses more or less the same statistic in this letter (page 6) from January 2017 to the European Parliament about reforming job regulations. ‘At present, based on what Member States notified in the regulated professions database, there are over 5,500 regulated professions across the EU.’ The statistic is even a bit higher, and the EC refers to this database as a source. The database is publicly accessible and serves as guidance for people who wish to expand (or move) their work to another European country. The database is continuously updated by the member states themselves and at the time of writing holds 6,517 entries in total, and 5,810 across the EU.   Screenshot of a visualization of the database. Source: European Commission Inflated statistic The number is significantly higher than the claimed 5,000, but does not necessarily mean that there are 5,810 different regulated professions. It means that there are 5,810 different sets of rules for jobs across the EU, and because the regulations are added on a national level there is quite a lot of overlap. For instance, there are fourteen entries for ‘lawyer’. Those are not necessarily fourteen different professions, but regulations for lawyers in fourteen different countries.  What might inflate the statistic even more is the fact that a lot of professions have multiple entries in the same country because they are split in very specific subcategories. The aforementioned Commission letter acknowledges this, writing that ‘for each generic profession there are usually many more professions covered by the national terminology. This is because under each generic profession there are several sub-professions.’ For instance, the Netherlands has an entry for someone who does inspections on light vehicles, and someone who examines heavy vehicles. They are separately registered in the database, but we probably both call them a car mechanic.   Generic names That’s why the Commission publishes another database where the regulations are grouped by ‘generic names of professions’. This database has only 590 entries. For example, ‘air traffic controller‘ contains ten different entries in different countries (and languages). They might slightly differ on a national level and could therefore be seen as ten different professions (except the entry for air traffic controller instructor), or as one profession as a whole, so it depends on what constitutes a profession. And although the database gives a good indication, the statistic is not very reliable because, as the warning above the page states, ‘Member States are free to choose under which generic heading they insert their regulated professions’ and therefore the activities could overlap between different groups.   Defining profession So what exactly is a profession? The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as ‘the people who do a particular type of work, considered as a group’ and ‘jobs that need special training and skill, such as being a doctor or lawyer’. With this definition, we might give the generic professions the benefit of the doubt, but the practitioners of the national sub-professions could be considered a group as well, so the answer remains unclear.   Conclusion Even though the number of 5,000 regulated professions is widely used, it is an unreliable statistic because of the overlapping regulations between EU countries and the fact that member states themselves maintain the database, seemingly without much oversight. Furthermore, if we consider the generic names of professions to be closer to the definition of a profession, 590 seems to be more accurate. Both statistics are unreliable, but because the difference between the numbers is so large, we consider it unlikely that the number of regulated professions is actually 5,000.

Eppink based his claim on a recent survey by Ipsos and, as it seems, on an article in national newspaper De Telegraaf. However, there is more to this than meets the eye! FvD-leader Derk Jan Eppink in the Nieuwsuur election debate. Dutch citizens on climate policy The debate was broadcast by Nieuwsuur, a Dutch news programme on national television. FvD party leader Derk Jan Eppink is heard referring to a survey carried out by Ipsos (PDF, 28 February 2019) on behalf of the Dutch national daily De Telegraaf: ‘Dutch citizens on climate policy’. It discusses various subjects, such as: climate change, agreement on climate change, climate measures, financing of climate policy and political borderlines. Eppink subsequently seems to follow the conclusion of a De Telegraaf article published shortly after the report was issued. A closer look at the report paints a broader picture. In response to the general question whether they are willing to make a financial contribution to climate policy, 60 percent of GreenLeft (GL) voters agreed. With this, GreenLeft voters are the largest group willing to make a financial contribution. Most Democrats (D‘66) and Labour Party (PvdA) voters also indicate to contribute. In contrast: only a small percentage of Socialist Party (SP) Freedom Party (PVV) and FvD voters are willing to contribute. Financial contributions While Eppink accuses GreenLeft voters that they want to contribute only 10 euros per month, this is not the complete story, as is shown in the graph below: indeed 43 percent of GreenLeft voters in The Netherlands state that they are personally willing to contribute approximately 10 euros per month to climate policy. But, the research also shows that in total 42 percent of the GreenLeft constituency are willing to contribute more than 10 euros. The highest percent of all parties. And 5 percent declares they are willing to contribute more than 100 euros per month to climate policy. Conclusion The statement of FvD’s party leader Epping “Recent research by Ipsos showed that the GreenLeft constituency wants to raise around 10 euros per month for climate policy. It appears to be not that popular with the members of GreenLeft” – is mostly false. Overall a majority of 60% is willing to contribute financially to climate policy. It is however true that a part of GreenLeft voters (43%) is ‘only’ willing to contribute 10 euros to climate policy. Nonetheless, an equal percentage (42%) is willing to contribute more than 10 euro’s to climate policy. The conclusion that climate policy is apparently not that popular with the voters of GreenLeft  is therefore one-sided and the claim mostly false.

Kinnunen is the chairman of The Finns Party Youth and a candidate in the upcoming European Parliament elections. The tweet was part of the discussion around the Finnish parliamentary elections of 2019.  The Finns Party is in general against the federalisation of the European Union. Kinnunen wants Finland to have a strong independent military since he does not believe in other countries’ willingness to defend Finland. He has been talking about the topic actively especially on Twitter.  An opinion poll conducted by WIN/Gallup International in 2014 showed that the people’s willingness to defend their country is low in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. 29 percent of the French, 27 percent of the Brits, and 18 percent of the Germans were ready to stand for their country if needed. The sample size for the poll was around 1000 people per country. Compared to the populations of these countries this might look like a relatively low sample size, but it is a common number and the margin of error is very low. WIN/International Gallup can be deemed a trustworthy source. It was a  co-operation of two independent polling firms, the Gallup International Association and the Worldwide Independent Network of Market Research. These are some of the largest polling firms in their respective regions. The co-operation ended in 2017, and the poll about people’s willingness  to defend their country only remains in Gallup International’s Bulgarian division’s archaic-looking site, which seems a little odd. The site still is most likely authentic.  Common security policy in the EU gets a yes from Germany, France and the United Kingdom According to the Standard Eurobarometer conducted in 2018, many Europeans are in favour of a common defence and security policy among EU member states. 86 percent of the Germans, 74 percent of the French and 63 percent of the British are for this idea. It is noteworthy that Germany, France, and the United Kingdom belong to NATO. This leads us to think that the people of these countries trust that the EU will work together in the future, if a common security policy is needed. Also, according to a Forsa poll conducted on behalf of the RTL Group, Germans thought that Europe was not dependent on help from the outside, for example the United States. 37 percent thought that Europe needed military help from the US. The poll was conducted in July 2018. European Defence Agency has no statistics on the subject Asseri Kinnunen told us over the phone that to his recollection the WIN/Gallup International poll was the same one he referred to in his tweet. From the way he described the poll we have concluded that it is probably the same one. We have not found any other research on the topic. We asked if the European Defence Agency (EDA) had any information about the topic, and on 24 April we received an answer: “Unfortunately, we have no statistics or information about the topic you mentioned, nor do we know any other research done on this question or institution which could [you] provide you with the requested info.” Opinions have not changed much in Finland and Norway We looked at statistics from Finland and Norway for reference. These countries ask their citizens’ willingness to defend their country on a survey every year. The surveys are made by The Advisory Board for Defence Information (ABDI) in Finland and People and Defence in Norway. Both of these are in some way connected to the parliaments of these countries. We chose to investigate the surveys from 2014 to 2018 because the survey by WIN/Gallup International was conducted in 2014. Our goal was simply to see if the willingness to defend one’s own country had decreased or increased among these two countries. In Finland the willingness to defend one´s own country increased by 3 percentage points after 2014. During the following few years the percentage stayed at 87, but it decreased back to 84 in 2018. In Norway, the percentage grew by 8 percentage points from 67 in 2014 to 75 in 2017 but came down to 72 in 2018. These results show that while the willingness to defend one’s country can change over the years, it is unlikely to have a change of tens of percentage points in five years in the case of Germany, France or the United Kingdom either. A change of tens of percentage points would be needed before one could talk about a majority, that is over 50 percent. Conclusion Since we could not find any other surveys on this exact topic, we do not know if the opinions have changed in any way since 2014. A lot has happened in five years, so opinions could differ today. For example, the crisis and on-going war in Ukraine could have affected the results. It is reasonable to assume that there are no other polls on the topic, and therefore Kinnunen’s phrasing, which implied that there have been several studies on the subject, is incorrect. However, it remains unclear if other polls on the subject have been conducted that are yet to be published. We have concluded that Kinnunen’s claim is uncheckable. The only poll that was found supported his claim, but there does not seem to be any other research on the topic. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

However, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, president of the association, thinks there is a health risk for students if a country switches to summer time permanently: The probability of sleeping and learning problems, depression and diabetes has demonstrably massively increased, he is quoted by the news portal “Merkur.de”. The empirical basis for this claim is good but not perfect. Basically, humans adjust their internal clock to the time when the daily sun position has reached its highest point, the biological noon. For example, the biologist and medical scientific journalist Maren Schenk describes the relationships between the organism and time change in the “Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift”, a German medical journal of the Thieme Verlag in Stuttgart, published on 25 October 2012. If the clock is put forward by one hour this system falls into imbalance, which is the reason why many people suffer from the time change and complain about sleeping disorders and organic ailments.  On 29th of March in 2018, the online magazine “Riffreporter” published the article: “Die Zeitumstellung ist kein Mini-Jetlag, sondern schlimmer” (“The time change is not a mini jet lag, but worse”). Chronobiologist Till Roenneberg of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich thinks that the clock change is not the only health risk, but there’s also the already existing lack of sleep in the population. “The current summer time regime simply moves our social obligations eastward for one time zone without leaving our biological time zone,” says Roenneberg. Above all, pupils and students are affected by the permanent summer time, because at a young age people’s inner rhythm shifts. With too little sleep it is increasingly difficult to process the material taught. According to the above statements, a biological adaptation to the changed time for humans is therefore not really possible. The clock change without a changing course of the sun alongside the chronobiological rhythm adapting to that change can subsequently lead to permanent drowsiness and fatigue. Poor sleep leads to health problems The sleep hormone melatonin plays a major role in the discussion of the permanent changeover to summer time. The hormone enormously affects the biological clock of the human body. It is secreted during the dark hours by the pineal gland of the brain. In the morning, the melatonin level drops again. If the biological rhythm is ignored or manipulated as in time change or during periods of shift work, this can lead to significant health consequences. The journal “Life Sciences” published a study called “Association between light at night, melatonin secretion, sleep deprivation, and the internal clock: Health impacts and mechanisms of circadian disruption” on March 15th, 2017. It shows that especially in shiftworking, the effect of artificial light and thus the suppression of natural melatonin secretion at night leads to a disruption of both the circadian system, the sleep-wake rhythm of humans and to chronic sleep deprivation. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that this desynchronization of night shift workers has long-term unhealthy consequences such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular risk and obesity. As a result of the changeover to summer time, the adaptation process of the organism to the light conditions is thus considerably disturbed and also has an effect on other biological processes in the human body. On the 16th of March, 2011 the German medical journal “Der Internist” published a scientific article titled “Schlechter Schlaf als Risikofaktor für das metabolische Syndrom” (“Poor sleep as a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome”). According to epidemiological studies, there is clear evidence of a link between sleep duration, sleep quality and the risk of developing diabetes mellitus as part of metabolic syndrome, the combination of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity, hypertension and lipid metabolism disorder. According to the journal, several studies show that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus with a sleep duration of less than 5 hours or more than 9 hours is twice as high as with an 8-hour sleep duration, including “The Nurses Health Study” from the 1980s. Expert asks for a cautious interpretation But not only the duration of sleep but also the qualitity of sleep has an influence on the development of diabetes. Clinical experimental studies such as “Slow-wave sleep and the risk of type 2 diabetes in humans” in 2008 showed that poor sleep is one cause of a disturbed energy metabolism. This leads to increased appetite and hunger, a reduction in insulin sensitivity, i. e. the sensitivity of the body cells to insulin, a heightened appetite and hunger sensation as well as a lack of exercise in everyday life. All these are factors and triggers for the metabolic syndrome in humans. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome can certainly be triggered by other sleep disorders. Endocrinologist PD Dr. med. Norbert Lotz of the Diabetes Center in Kempten, Bavaria, however is of the opinion: “A frequent coincidence of diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome and sleep disorder is proven only for the sleep apnea syndrome.” Therefore sleep apnea, accumulated nocturnal breathing pauses with oxygen deficiency in the brain, must be excluded in advance in order to evaluate the described relationships. This disease has been proven to increase the risk of diabetes. That’s why the conclusion that sleep deprivation generally leads to an increased risk for this metabolic disorder is not sufficiently proven by randomized studies. Here still exists considerable need for medical research. Summing everything up, it is difficult to regard the statement of the German Teachers’ Association that a permanent switch to Daylight Saving Time leads to sleep or learning problems as well as to depression and diabetes as a given fact. The switch certainly carries risks for learning and sleep problems. But so far current medical studies show no clear evidence for the development of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and defined mental illness due to general sleep deprivation. Therefore the claim is judged to be only mostly true.  RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Annika Bingger, Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, DE   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

121,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-youth-unemployment-rate-in-croatia-decreased-by-more-than-half-because-of-government-policies/,Youth unemployment rate in Croatia decreased by more than half due to government policies,2019-05-13,eufactcheck,,"As part of his pre-election campaign, a Croatian candidate in European elections Mr Karlo Ressler of the currently ruling party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), claimed that the youth unemployment halved since the EU accession [since HDZ is in power] and optimistically stated that since then 96,000 new jobs have opened. Both statements are true, however, putting this in the context of a successful government is false and therefore shows how stats can be misused in the campaign for European elections. While campaigning in Croatia, a candidate for the European Parliament Mr Karlo Ressler said: ”Since Croatia became a member of the EU, youth unemployment decreased by more than half, while more than 96,000 jobs have opened in last three years “. He said this in the context of the benefits of EU membership and the successes of the government in which Ressler’s party HDZ has the majority.  First, it is true that the youth unemployment rate decreased by more than 50 percent, however this is not a consequence of successful policies of the government currently in power (or any other). According to Eurostat, in year 2013 only Greece and Spain had worse youth unemployment rates than Croatia. But today Croatia is still one of five EU countries with highest youth unemployment rates. While in year 2013 Croatia was ranked third, in year 2018 it is fourth, with Greece, Spain and Italy holding the top three places of youth unemployment in the European Union. On the other hand, it is true that the youth unemployment rate went down 54 percent in comparison with the rate in year 2013. How can the rate go down more than fifty percent, yet Croatia went down only one place? According to Dr Kristijan Kotarski, who teaches the Theory of Economic Policy at the University of Zagreb, this is the result of the recovery of the Eurozone economy after the ECB has started to implement quantitative easing policy by 2015.  Furthermore, this opens an even bigger issue, or probably currently the biggest issue in Croatia. Dr Kristijan Kotarski said in an interview: “The drop of youth unemployment rates in the age group of 15-29 is primarily a result of mass emigration after EU membership.” Mass emigration from Croatia has been an issue of concern in the country, but also a matter of debate. When Croatia became an EU member state in year 2013, it gained all the benefits of the so-called four freedoms – the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. This encouraged Croats to search for a brighter future beyond the borders of their homeland.  Here we get to the main reasons why the matter of emigration is the focus of debate in Croatia. On the one hand, a first look at the above mentioned Eurostat figures shows that in year 2018, there were 65,000 less young people unemployed than in year 2013. However, at the same time the number of youth employment increased by 44,000 people. So where did the other 21,000 young people go? The National Institute for Statistics recorded 24,250 young people emigrating from Croatia between years 2013 and 2017. On the other hand, other reports and estimations state that the number of Croatians, predominantly youth, that left the country is significantly higher. According to this report by the European Social Policy Network, “although figures from foreign statistical offices may slightly overstate the figures (including Croatian passport holders who were not living in Croatia, for example), it is clear that true levels of emigration from Croatia are higher than official statistics suggest, perhaps double or even triple.” This research study gives an even more troubling estimation: “Our indirect emigration estimates show that emigration from Croatia to the core EU countries following the accession is on average around 2.6 times higher than the officially registered numbers in Croatia, with around 230 thousands people having left Croatia and settled in one of the analyzed core EU countries in the 2013-2016 period.”  Both studies point out that official stats are based on voluntary reports to the authorities. Paul Stubbs and Siniša Zrinščak from the mentioned ESPN Flash Report emphasize: “Without a population census, tighter enforcement of a 2012 Law which requires anyone leaving Croatia for a year or more to cancel their residence permit, or representative survey data, any figures used are no more than an informed guess.” The Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list conducted a journalistic study of national statistics on immigration in Austria, Ireland and Germany, which are the “top destinations” for Croatian emigrants, and found that at least 250,000 Croatian citizens moved to these countries in the last five years. Only in year 2018, the German records show that 56,000 Croatian citizens applied for residency in Germany. We checked the data and the stats quoted by the journalist in this article and they are correct.  Here we come back to the part of Mr Karlo Ressler’s statement in which he said that 96,000 new job placements opened in Croatia. According to the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute, between year 2016 and today the number of people paying pension insurance increased by 96,000 new users. However, at the same time period 338,150 jobs were closed. Therefore, the number Ressler gave is correct, but when placed into context, it is not at all encouraging for any Croatian. If the current Croatian government is indeed responsible for 96,000 new job placements, it is also for those jobs that closed.  Ultimately, even though Mr Karlo Ressler used two true stats – that there are 96,000 new jobs and that the youth unemployment rates in Croatia are down 50 percent – there are two issues. First, the fall in youth unemployment rates are hardly a merit of the government currently in power, but of a recovery of the economic crisis at the level of the EU as a whole. Croatia is still in the top five EU countries with highest youth unemployment rates anyway. Also, the estimations of how many Croatians emigrated in the last six years could also be part of the explanation for lower unemployment rates. Second, the number of jobs that opened do not look so optimistic when put into context, concretely in comparison with the number of jobs that closed.  Finally, this statement is a good example of how numbers can be used by candidates in any election, the government itself or anyone to claim something without providing the whole context. A good PR spin conceals a worrisome present and an uncertain future, therefore we assess that this statement by Mr Karlo Ressler is mostly false.

122,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-nuclear-power-is-climate-smart/,“Nuclear power is climate smart”,2019-05-10,eufactcheck,,"One of the big question in the European Parliament Elections 2019 is sustainable energy. The liberal-conservative political party Moderaterna in Sweden has stated during their EU-election campaign that “Nuclear power is climate smart”. This is not totally true. Moderaterna stated this slogan in different social media as Twitter and Instagram. The slogan is also reported about in different media, as Svenska Dagbladet. For example, Jessica Rosencrantz, member of the Swedish parliament and representative of Moderaterna tweeted on 8th April that “Should we reach our climate goals and electrify our transports to make ourselves independent of fossil fuels, both nuclear power and renewable energy are needed”.    Referring to the recent IPCC report from 2018, parts of the report emphasize the importance of systematic change for EU 2030 climate goals of 1.5 degrees. The report translates into four main systems: energy, land and ecosystem, urban and infrastructure. IPCC does not provide an exact solution to the issue, it does howewer show different ways how it could be solved. Moderaterna says that we need nuclear power to reach the 1.5 degrees goal. In a debate, broadcasted by the Swedish public service tv, STV, on April 8th, the party leader of Moderaterna, Ulf Kristensson, said that we can not phase out the nucelar powers in Sweden in order to reach the climate goals.    The reason Moderaterna claims nuclear power as “climate smart” is because it is fossil free.  Due to the increasing electrification of society, more electricity needs to be produced. Moderaterna sees nuclear power as a solution to this and claims it should be the predominantly used source of energy in Sweden. The reason Moderaterna claims nuclear power as “climate smart” is because it is fossil free.   IPCC – yes or no? Yes, nuclear power could be a solution to rising climate changes. But according to Joeri Rogelj, one of the authors of the IPCC-report “Global Warming 1,5 Degrees Celsius”, the report does not in fact say that IPCC prescribes any solution to the problem. On April 2th 2019, Rogelj stated in the Swedish magazine Sveriges Natur that he thinks many have misinterpreted IPCC:s latest rapport. Nuclear power is not stated as a necessity, but as one of many possibilities. “The IPCC has not claimed that we need a large increase in nuclear power. Saying this is a misinterpretation of the report”, Joeri Rogelj states in the article. In a report of 2013 the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, SSNC, mentioned a lot of issues that nuclear power comes with. In the report “Finn fem fel på kärnkraften” SSNC lists costs, environmental harmfulness, the waste issue and accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima as some of the reasons to not go on with nuclear power. SSNC also states that a energy system is not sustainable if it is not 100 percent renewable. This is also in line with The energy report 100% renewable energy 2050, written 2014 by World Wildlife Fund, WWF.   Conclusion Nuclear power is in fact, as Moderaterna claims, fossil free but comes with too many non environmental consequences in order to be considered climate smart. We have tried to contact Moderaterna for a chance to reply to the information presented in this fact-check, but they declined to answer.     Purely factual, according to IPCC, SSNC and WWF’s reports, it is misleading to claim nuclear is “climate smart”.  We also contacted Jesper Gyberg, expert in environment and agriculture committee for Moderaterna, but he also declined to answer our questions. Therefore, the statement “Nuclear is climate smart” by Moderaterna should be considered mostly false. Purely factual, according to IPCC, SSNC and WWF’s reports, it is misleading to claim nuclear is “climate smart”.     RESEARCH | ARTICLE ©: Susan Mokhtarian, Lana Zand, Linda Svensson Krupke, Stephanie Wilhelmsson","https://www.svd.se/karnkraften-hallbar-och-klimatsmart,https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/,http://www.sverigesnatur.org/aktuellt/karnkraftsutbyggnad-behovs-inte-enligt-ipcc-en-misstolkning-av-rapporten/,https://docplayer.se/75546-Rapport-finn-fem-fel-pa-karnkraften.html,https://www.wwf.se/dokument/the-energy-report-2011-100-renewable-energy-by-2050/,https://www.instagram.com/",“Nuclear power is climate smart”,,,,,,
123,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/does-article-13-open-the-door-to-censorship/,Does Article 13 open the door to censorship?,2019-05-10,eufactcheck,,"Article 13 of the new European copyright law anticipates a lot of resistance. The law wants to ensure that content creators are better protected. On March 26, a Flemish member of the European Parliament Anneleen Van Bossuyt (N-VA) voted against the European reformation of copyright law. In an article that appeared on the website of Flanders’ public broadcasting service VRT News, Van Bossuyt says it is unfortunate that Europe will now increase the monitoring on what appears on Google and Facebook: “The obligatory filter system is a modern version of a censorship machine. From now on we will not get to see a lot of videos because the filters are not capable to differentiate the exceptions on copyright laws such as parodies, they will not recognize it and therefore out of precaution will hold them back.” But is this statement true? Does Article 13 open the door to censorship. After research it appears that this claim is uncheckable. The European Parliament approved the controversial ‘Article 13’ on March 26. This article states that platforms like YouTube and Facebook should be held responsible for the copyright content of their users. This might result in platforms having to delete content, if there is no agreement between the creator and the platform. Besides that, platforms are obliged to incorporate automatic filters to make sure that users cannot download the copyrighted content. A number of experts confirm the statement of Anneleen Van Bossuyt (N-VA). At the time being, there is a so called ‘value gap’ in which the authors don’t generate their earnings, while platforms benefit from enormous amounts of ad revenue. Article 13 is supposed to be the solution for this problem. Marie-Christine Janssens, professor of copyright law at KU Leuven, says that the platforms will be held fully accountable for violation. “The platforms are going to be very concerned about their liability and will probably block content. It is something that has been going on for a while already, but now we fear they might block too much. The consequence of this ‘overblocking’ would be that content, such as parodies or content that has been quoted, would be affected. Also Matthias Dobbelaere-Welvaert, lecturer ‘Copyright and Media Rights’ at the Erasmus University of Brussels, confirms the possible side effect of Article 13 as a censorship machine. “The new legislation might not be a good measure for you and me,” writes Dobbelaere-Welvaert in an opinion piece. “Article 13 will also hamper technological innovation within the European Union,” says Dobbelaere-Welvaert. “Companies will choke on EU legislation, while their cousins in the US or China can do as they please.” Dobbelaere-Welvaert also sees some practical problems. He predicts that websites will create their own upload filters. In that way, a new kind of public debate will develop on social media. Moreover, discussions will be based on rumors with no background information and no longer based on reputable new sources. Illustration: Brent Saey The Belgian consumer organization Test Aankoop calls Article 13 “a major obstacle to the freedom of creation, for the transfer of knowledge and in that way also for freedom of expression in general”. But at the same time Test Aankoop supports the purpose to reform the copyright. According to Test Aankoop recent examples have shown that the use of those automatic filters by platforms like YouTube and Facebook, are not smart enough to distinguish content that infringes copyright and legal content. However, there are experts who contradict the statement. Bart Staes, member of the European Parliament who represents Groen (Flemish political party) opts for the creative ability, “although the proposal still contains defects”. Hilde Vautmans, member of the European Parliament who represents Open Vld (another Flemish political party), sees no censorship and no restriction of freedom of expression for ordinary users. “Thanks to the rules we have approved, we’re able to end the Wild West for big internet platforms. There main goal is/was to make profit out of large available amounts of copyright material”, says Vautmans. The opponents of Article 13 say that it is indeed a censorship machine that is going to limit creativity because of the upload filters. The proponents on the other hand, want to end large corporations who unfairly make a lot of money with ad sales. Also, those proponents want to protect the artists by giving them what they’re entitled to. As you can see, there are various views, but both sides agree that this copyright law should be reconsidered carefully. Therefore, this claim is uncheckable.","https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/26/anneleen-van-bossuyt-nv-a-dit-is-het-einde-van-het-internet/,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/illustr-13.png,https://www.instagram.com/",Does Article 13 open the door to censorship?,,,,,,
124,,,,T,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/true-the-eu-continues-to-pay-to-turkey/,“The EU continues to pay to Turkey”,2019-05-08,eufactcheck,,"On March 23rd, 2019 Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria’s vice-chancellor and party head of the right wing party FPÖ, stated that “Turkey continues to receive European tax money” and demanded on his Facebook page that EU payments towards Turkey had to stop. But is it true that the EU is still paying money to Turkey as a candidate country? The answer is yes.  Here the original claim: “The EU (Karas’ EPP and Schieder’s Socialists) rejected our request to discontinue accession negotiations with Turkey and suspended the negotiations only in time. Turkey continues to receive European tax money. We, the Freedom Party, want to make a clear line with our European partners: to completely abolish the accession negotiations and not to make payments to Turkey.” What the EU pays The EU pays money to Turkey, even quite a lot. In the period from 2014 to 2020 Turkey is entitled to 4.5 billion Euros according to official information on the website of the European Commission. It receives the money as part of a so-called pre-accession assistance which should help a candidate country to implement reforms towards the EU’s goals. So far, in this period a few hundred million have been paid out. The money will go to projects strengthening civil society and the rule of law, energy projects, education and agriculture. This should facilitate adaptation to EU standards. The EU rapporteur to Turkey, Kati Piri, argued in the past that the payments should not be stopped as NGOs in Turkey would also benefit from them. Many funds are also flowing into Turkish infrastructure projects some of which are linked to the ruling AKP party as reported by German weekly “Die Zeit”. The EU can not simply award the money to civil society groups. Turkey has a say in the use of pre-accession aid. This was criticized by the European Court of Auditors. Irrespective of this financial assistance, Turkey receives money through the so-called 2016 Ankara Refugee Agreement. The agreement provides for EU payments to Turkey for the promise of letting fewer refugees into Europe. A total of 6 billion Euros has been set aside of which 3.2 billion Euros have already been paid. This means that even if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to end as demanded by the FPÖ, there would be payments to Turkey. The pre-accession aid would disappear, but the refugee agreement would continue. The question is if Turkey is willing to preserve the Ankara Refugee Agreement if the pre-accession assistance were to be cut. The FPÖ’s goal is to cut all European tax money which Turkey received due to their status as a pre-accession country. But what about the Ankara Refugee Agreement?  A spokesperson from the FPÖ confirmed that the FPÖ was in favor of the Refugee Agreement, as the party wants less refugees to come to Europe and believes into help programs on site. At the same time, the FPÖ added, that in case that Greece stops to deport refugees to Turkey, the Ankara Refugee Agreement would lose its original purpose and should be abandoned. So FPÖ party leader Heinz-Christian Strache’s statement that Turkey continues to receive money from the EU is true. Also his statement that it is taxpayer’s money that is spent, holds true. The EU budget consists largely of certain shares of the respective member states. The calculation of these shares is based on gross national income.

German right-wing politicans like Alice Weidel of the right-wing populist party AfD says ‘yes’. The criminal statistics seem to support this claim but the number of suspected criminals is small in all population groups. This quote is an excerpt of a Facebook post Alice Weidel published on 25 March 2019. She is co-chair of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), a right-wing populist party in Germany with extreme right-wing tendencies. In this Facebook post, she refers to an article of the public broadcaster Südwestrundfunk (SWR) which in turn refers to the security report of the state of Baden-Württemberg “Sicherheit 2018”. This is the second annual report published since 2017 by the Ministry of the Interior, Digitisation and Migration of Baden-Württemberg in cooperation with the Criminal Police Office of this state. According to the safety report, a total of 23,332 offences of aggression were recorded in public space in Baden-Württemberg in 2018. Such offences are defined as “crimes committed with the use or threat of physical violence”. Of these acts of aggression, 14,314 were committed by Germans, 9,018 by non-Germans and 2,578 by asylum seekers or refugees. Measured against the total number of cases, the number of refugees suspected of having committed an offence corresponds to about 11% – a rise from 3% or 6% a couple of years earlier. But to check whether they are over-represented, one has to look beyond these numbers.   !function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Offences against sexual self-determinationInfogram The last number of refugees registered by the Federal Statistical Office in Baden-Württemberg was 194,120 (source: Federal Statistical Office). Assuming this number of inhabitants, regardless of immigration and emigration in any form and time and calculating the respective proportion of recorded aggression offences for the year 2018, about 1.3% of all refugees living in Baden-Württemberg would have been suspects in aggression offences. In order to compare this quota with the “remaining” population, the total number of inhabitants of Baden-Württemberg minus the refugees or asylum seekers, is calculated to be 10,829,305. The total number of aggression offences committed by German or non-German suspects in the public sphere according to the safety report amounts to 23,332 cases. According to these numbers, about 0.2% of the “remaining” population would have been suspects in aggression offences. The same approach is used to calculate the proportions of the respective population groups in connection with offences against sexual self-determination. The total number of these offences in 2018 amounted to 7,607 cases. German or non-German suspects were 5,326 of them, the number of suspected refugees or asylum seekers was 708. Measured against the total number of population groups, suspected asylum seekers and refugees account for 0.36%, the rest of suspects 0.05%. The calculations with the figures in the Security Report show that refugees and asylum seekers under suspicion actually account for a higher proportion of recorded offences of aggression and offences against sexual self-determination than the rest of the population. Weidel’s statement is therefore correct. Political actors, such as the AfD in this case, try to establish a firm link between migration and crime from this, “[…] in order to underpin demands for increasingly harsh measures to counter migration”, as the criminal law expert Christian Walburg writes. However, it is difficult to compare two population groups that are so different and differentiated. Among refugees and asylum seekers, there is “[…] as among the population as a whole, a small proportion of the highly burdened, while the vast majority do not commit crimes.” Similarly, Walburg points out, among immigrants there is a particularly large number of young men which are more likely to commit crimes. Alice Weidel from the German right-wing party AfD has tried to establish a link between migration and crime by claiming that refugees and asylum seekers are over-represented as suspects in aggression offences and offences against sexual self-determination. The criminal statistics of the state Baden-Württemberg support Weidel’s claim. However, we rate this claim only as mostly true because it does not account for the fact that the vast majority of refugees and asylum seekers do not commit such crimes.       RESEARCH | ARTICLE © Marcel Posa, Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, DE","https://www.facebook.com/aliceweidel/photos/a.1063313067013261/2434890673188820/?type=3&theater,https://im.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/publikation/did/sicherheitsbericht-2018/?tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bsearch%5d=Kriminal&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5btopics%5d=-1&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bsubmit%5d=1&tx_rsmbwpublications_pi3%5bministries%5d=3&cHash=dc7b9ecd0bc75a91e3541f139c355064,https://infogram.com/7fa8ffc7-89f7-4812-a16a-61336b7e10ab,https://infogram.com,https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Migration-Integration/Tabellen/schutzsuchende-bundeslaender.html,http://www.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/innere-sicherheit/272522/migration-und-kriminalitaet,https://www.instagram.com/",“Asylum seekers and refugees are clearly over-represented in both sexual assaults and aggression offences”,,,,,,
126,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/1709/,“No one takes the airplane from Brussels to Paris”,2019-04-29,eufactcheck,,"In an article from the news site ‘De Standaard’ (date: March 8th), Brussels Airlines claims that no one takes the airplane only to travel from Brussels to Paris. This statement was made in the debate on the impact of short flights on climate change. In the article there is no mention of which sources or data support this statement. When we contacted Brussels Airlines, asking for their specific arguments in the ruling, the tone is immediately more moderate. According to Brussels Airlines’ spokeswoman Kim Daenen, 2% of the passengers for the flight between Brussels and Paris don’t continue their travels with a connecting flight via Brussels Airlines. Whether or not these passengers stay in Paris or have a connecting flight via a different airline, is not clear. Brussels Airlines also clarifies that these flights aren’t promoted or encouraged in any way. Nevertheless, two flights from Brussels to Paris are available on a daily basis. Flights that span a distance of less than a thousand kilometres, such as those between Brussels and Paris, are discouraged by Brussels Airlines through their high cost price. Yet we wonder why these short-haul flights are scheduled this frequently. Two flights a day equal more than seven hundred flights a year.  Also the fact that the airline doesn’t discourage other short-haul flights, is highly remarkable. The travel routes between Brussels and Milan or Berlin are also less than a thousand kilometres, but when we present that question to Brussels Airlines, they tell us that those destinations are not feasible by train. Alternatives  Another article of the newspaper ‘De Standaard’ (March 6th) tells us that among Belgian politicians many would support the discontinuance of short-haul flights. Solutions and collaborations among different parties are being sought after, but so far none of those have proven to be successful in the past. For example, Brussels Airlines, in collaboration with Thalys, have tried to offer alternatives in the form of high-speed train routes. This project never really caught on, due to the fact that many passengers often had to transfer. On his way to Paris the high-speed train always departs from Brussels South train station, and doesn’t drive past the airport of Zaventem. The Brussels Airlines spokeswoman also says that if this train were to stop at the airport, it could very well be an alternative to short-haul flights. Conclusion To say that ‘no one takes the airplane from Brussels to Paris’, is pretty blunt. From the information the spokeswoman has given us, we can conclude that 2% of the passengers on these flights don’t have a connecting flight via Brussels Airlines. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that these passengers don’t have connecting flights through other airlines. We therefore consider this statement to be ‘mostly true’.",https://www.instagram.com/,“No one takes the airplane from Brussels to Paris”,,,,,,
127,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-europe-outlaws-the-raccoon-shoot-them/,‘Europe outlaws the raccoon,2019-04-25,eufactcheck,,"According to an article on the website of Belgian newspaper De Morgen, the EU has decided that in order to exterminate the raccoon from EU countries the only solution is to shoot them. We rate the claim as mostly false.  On April 5, De Morgen reported on the increasing nuisance of raccoons in Flanders. The cute and seemingly cuddly animals kill chickens and can cause harm to humans by biting and carrying parasites. ‘What to do? Shoot them, says the European Union’, the article reads, suggesting that the raccoons have to be shot because it was added to a European blacklist for invasive species, which EU member states are obligated to combat. The list that the article is referring to is called the ‘list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern’, or ‘the Union list’ in short. The list was established in 2014 based on an EU regulation concerning the management of invasive species and is regularly updated. The raccoon is indeed on there, but what’s curious is that the animal was added years ago, on August 3, 2016.  But what does the mention on the list mean for the raccoon? In other words, what actions are required by the EU member states when species are added to the list? ‘Member States are required to take action on […] the early detection and rapid eradication of these species’, the accompanying text on the list’s website reads. That might sound like member states don’t have much choice but to just shoot them. But when we dive into the underlying legal text we find that it is not an obligation to outright kill the invasive species. Article 19 (2) clearly states that ‘the management measures shall consist of lethal or non-lethal physical, chemical or biological actions.’ Furthermore, the text explicitly says that ‘non-lethal methods should be considered’. One expert in the Belgian article acknowledges that there are ‘more humane ways to contain the rise of the raccoon. ‘You can trap them and bring them to animal shelters. And if there is no other way, there is the option of euthanasia.’ The raccoon has indeed been added to the list of invasive species and has to be controlled either way. In principle the population has to be wiped out, but the regulation leaves room for interpretation. ‘In the event that eradication is not feasible or the costs of eradication outweigh the environmental, social and economic benefits in the long term, containment and control measures should be applied.’ The text does not specify when eradication would not be feasible or when costs outweigh the benefits. In conclusion, the fact that raccoons have been added to the invasive species list means that the European population has to be curtailed. But it is not specified how that has to be done; they may be shot, but don’t have to be. Furthermore, member states can turn to control measures if they decide that eradication is not feasible.

This claim has received worldwide attention. What do the statistics say about the religious background of terrorism? The statement was published by the Australian senator Fraser Anning on the 15th  of march in 2019. The trigger behind his tweet was the terrorist attack  in Christchurch, New Zealand, which happened on the same day. In the  attack, a right-wing offender killed 50 people and injured 50 more.  Multiple European politicians reacted sympathetically towards New  Zealand and its people and enforced a multitude of extra safety measures  on their places of worship, said France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.  According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a research and education center at the University of Maryland in the USA, there were 10,900 terrorist attacks in 2017. 26,400 people lost their lives in these attacks. The annual report stated that the countries who reported the most deaths due to terror attacks were the Iraq (24%), Afghanistan (23%) and Syria (8%). Since there are no recent or specific studies on the religious association of the victims of terror attacks it’s not possible to state exact numbers of who is the primary victim group when it comes to religion. However, 90% of Syria’s, 97% of Iraq’s and 99% of Afghanistan’s population identify as Muslims. Due to that factor it’s probable that the majority of the victims in these countries are Muslims. The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) uses data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and is published annually by the Institute of Economics and Peace. The Index ranks 163 countries on how heavily they are affected by terrorism and reports a decline in Europe’s fatalities due to terrorism. The amount of fatalities due to terror attacks in Western-Europe were less than 1% in the international overview. In general, Western-Europe recorded a decline of terrorism. According to the latest Global Terrorism Index (GTI), the number of fatalities of terror attacks went down by 52%, from 168 to 81, compared to the previous year of 2016. The GTI also states that the total percentage of terror attacks in all of Europe went down by 75%. These numbers can be explained because there were multiple terrorist attacks in Europe in 2015 and 2016 (Paris, Berlin, Brussels) which resulted in exceptionally high numbers. According to these statistics it can be assumed that, in contrast to Anning’s statement “Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators”, Muslims weren’t just the victims in the attack of Christchurch but are the victims in most terrorist attacks.  Similar to the victims, it is impossible to find statistics on which religion the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks associate with. However, the START report of 2017 gives some insight. It shows that the majority of attacks are not carried out by a single offender but by someone who is part of or associates with a terrorist group. Four out of the five groups who are responsible for most terrorist attacks are driven by Islamic motivations: the “Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant” (ISIL), the “Taliban”, “Al-Shabaab” and “Boko Haram”. The fifth, Non-Islamic group, is the “New People’s Army” (NPA), which is a communistic party from the Philippines.  Based on these statistics it can be presumed that most of the terrorists are Muslims as well. In contrast to that, the GTI report stated that Western-Europe experienced most of their terror attacks due to “lone actors with far-right, white nationalist, or anti-Muslim beliefs”. This statement hints to the fact that Fraser Anning’s generalization, which paints Muslims as the perpetrators in all terrorist attacks, is not accurate. Fraser Anning’s statement refers to a terrorist attack in New Zealand and reflects his views as a right-wing Australian senator. His comment states that Muslims are more likely to be the executors of terrorist attacks than the victims. However, a conclusion that could be drawn from the statistics named above is that the majority of the victims of global terrorism are Muslims. They are the religious group which is most affected. However, based on the same statistics it could also be concluded that Muslims make up most of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, too. Nonetheless, the absence of specific data focussing on the religious affiliation of both victims and perpetrators of terrorism make Anning’s statement uncheckable.

This is what the Dutch progressive liberal party D66 states in a twitter response to a promotional ‘Nexit’ video by extreme right PVV leader Geert Wilders. To good to be true?  “The European Union yields 1500 to 2000 euro to every Dutchman annually.” It seems to be a statement with a long history. In 2012, former D66 party leader Alexander Pechtold claimed this for the first time, in the Dutch television program ‘Buitenhof’. From time to time, the party still uses the statement as an argument in favor of its pro-European Union attitude. For instance, on the 11th of April, 2019, when D66 posted a video including several benefits of European cooperation. The party refers to the CBS (the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics) as the source of its statement. However, CBS does not have any data about Dutch earnings from the EU. CBS does have data about remittance of all member states of the European Union. Mistake CBS being referred to as a source, seems to be a mistake. When several twitter users ask for factual explanation, the party refers to a CPB report (the Dutch Central Plan Bureau) about profits from the introduction of the euro. Not CBS. The report by the CPB is from 2014, and was written as a result of claims made in the book ‘Europa in Crisis’, by Coenraad Teulings, the CPB-president at the time. The report refers to the internal market analysis that the CPB carried out in 2008. In the report, it is noted that the total Dutch export of goods is 18 percent higher than it would be without an internal market. The effect of increased trade on the GDP was subsequently estimated. It is estimated that the GDP has increased between 4 to 6 percent. This means an income increase of 1500-2200 euros per year for an average income. However, the CPB places a large disclaimer on this data, as it is unknown as how the economy would have developed if there hadn’t been a common European market. Membership fee Of course, The Netherlands have to pay a membership fee to the European Union. This sum partly consists of VAT (value added tax) and a sum that is based on the height of the GNI (Gross National Income). The Netherlands also receive funds from the EU. For example: to carry out the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2017, the Dutch remittance to the EU was an estimated 6,9 billion euros. The Netherlands received 3,7 billion from the EU. All in all, it can be concluded that every Dutch citizen has to pay 187,35 euros to be a member of the European Union in 2017. If we subtract that last amount from the estimated income increase of an average income, the result is quite close to the 1500-2200 euros that the EU would bring all Dutch citizens per year, according to D66. However, there is a large number of ‘ifs and buts’ to this story. D66 claims that every Dutch citizen will receive an extra 1500-2000 euros per year, thanks to the EU. But this is not correct, since this only applies to average incomes. Moreover, the estimations by the CPB (like mentioned before) are not completely reliable, because we do not know how the economy would have developed without a common European market. In addition, the most recent data about EU earnings are from 2008. Since only this relatively old investigation has been used, it is unclear these data are still up-to-date. Conclusion   So, does the EU yield 1500 to 2000 euros to every Dutch citizen each year? If taken into consideration that the data that are used are from 2008, the statement made by D66 is mainly correct. However, we have to make too many reservations, which makes the statement uncheckable. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

In the popular Dutch talkshow Jinek she said that a quarter of all Turkish judges have been discharged already. In her capacity as rapporteur Piri investigates if Turkey meets the preconditions for EU-membership and if the country lives up to the agreements made with the EU so far. Her findings are presented in a yearly Turkey monitor. In 2018 the outcomes of her investigation even made her press the EU to suspend the accessions talks. In her opinion, talks with Turkey are pointless under conditions of disproportional repressive measures and an obvious move away from European values. At the same time Piri was denied access to the country, most likely due to her critical stance, since the attempted military coup. Kati Piri talks about human rights violations in the Dutch talkshow Jinek. At the talkshow table, Eva Jinek asked Piri about the obstacles for EU-membership of one of Europe’s southern border states. She mentioned that the human right situation is the major issue in Turkey. She gave several examples: ‘A quarter of all judges have been discharged already (…). Turkey is still a country with most journalists imprisoned.’ This last issue has been debated and criticized many times. But what about the judiciary? Independent judiciary at stakeIn her 2018-report Piri gives numbers for the amount of discharged judges since the state of emergency, shortly after the 2016 attempted coup. In total 152.000 civic employees, such as teachers, medical doctors, academics and judges have been laid down, according to Piri. It proved difficult to single out the exact number of judges based on this report. Asked for her source Piri mentioned the European Commission’s Turkey-report. The EC-report states that ‘there has been serious backsliding and the independence of the Turkish judiciary was severely undermined following, among other issues, the dismissal and forced removal of 30% of Turkish judges and prosecutors following the 2016 attempted coup.’ The report also gives exact numbers: ‘In total, since the attempted coup, 4 399 judges and prosecutors have been dismissed from their positions of which 454 were later reinstated to their positions by the CJP (Council of Judges and Prosecutors). There are currently over 4 000 judges and prosecutors against whom legal action has been taken (dismissals or suspension).’ Given these numbers the statement by Piri is mostly true. However at first 30% of all judges and prosecutors were discharged, about 5% was reinstalled bringing the total amount to a quarter. But….Piri could have been more precise by including the prosecutors in her statement, it is clear that she talks about the judiciary as a whole, but prosecutors and judges are by far not the same!

However and in contrast with the reports of the Pronews news website for 3,000 participants, the Golden Dawn party in its official press release argues that in the event attended few hundreds and not thousands of supporters. “The Stalinist Junta does not stop us: Flooding in the Golden Dawn Presentation – First Images” and the second “Full presentation of the candidates for the Golden Dawn MEPs – VIDEO“.  As a result, Pronews claims are not justified even from the official press release of Golden Dawn party.  This particular publication of Pronews is not true even though it essentially reproduces the Golden Dawn party press release.

This claim turns out to be true. This happens despite the fact that the country has not yet withdrawn from the EU – this was to be held on March 29. –  Life.ru refers to in Guardian. In turn, Guardian refers to the UK Home Office, which confirms changes in the design of a British passport: “Passports that include the words ‘European Union’ will continue to be issued for a short period after this date. You will not be able to choose whether you get a passport that includes the words ‘European Union’, or a passport that does not. Life.ru continues: “Such a step is justified by the “most rational use of taxpayers’ funds”, for which many blanks have already been purchased. However, according to representatives of the ministry, the words on the cover are the only difference between the documents, the British will not have problems moving around the country and the world. It is also noted that this year the main document of the British will undergo another change – the color of the cover will change. The burgundy one for the EU will be replaced with dark blue, as it was in the country until 1988. Also, a number of technical innovations will be added that will make the document “the most technologically advanced in the world”. P.S. While passports change, British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote a letter to the head of the European Council, Donald Tusk, with a request to postpone Brexit until June 30, said Euronews. May said that if agreement is reached before this date, the delay period will be shortened. “The government will want to establish a timeframe for ratifying the treaty, which will allow Britain to leave the EU before May 23, 2019 and cancel elections to the European Parliament. But we will continue to prepare responsibly for elections in case this framework is not established”, she wrote. So, despite the fact, that there are no guarantees that Britain will leave the EU in the coming year, nevertheless, UK Home Office,  on it’s website confirms information about the gradual “withdrawal from circulation” of “European” passports in Britain, so we conclude, that the information, published  by Life.ru  is true.

To add 3.500 soldiers at the borders? No, they didn’t!” On the 19th of January, Marie Arena, a Belgian Socialist MEP, presented some claims about military and customs changes in the post-Brexit UK. Marie Arena made these statements during a radio interview on the show Le Grand Oral on RTBF, a Belgian broadcasting channel for the French-speaking Community. She claims that an additional 3.500 soldiers will be posted at the British borders after the Brexit. Furthermore, she argues that 3.000 customs agents will be stationed at appropriate border stations. The Belgian MEP laments the Brexiteers for not informing the British people about possible logistical and mobilizational consequences such as these. A late 2018 measure Several British media and Euro watchers reported on the possible activation of military personnel as early as December of last year. Euractiv, a European news media with a close eye on policymaking, reported on a proposed temporary increase of soldiers on the 19th of December. The day before, British defence secretary Gavin Williamson announced that his department arranged for an amount of 3.500 soldiers to be put on standby in the following weeks in case of a no-deal Brexit. These troops would be used to deal with ‘any contingencies’, whatever those would be. In March, Politico followed up on this subject with an article detailing some specifics of the possible military operations. According to this article, the British government confirmed that Defense would install a new operations centre for these 3.500 stand-by troops. Any actions taken by these troops in case of a no-deal Brexit would fall under the recently dubbed ‘Operation Redfold’, while actions regarding contingencies would be part of ‘Operation Yellowhammer’. What these military actions could entail is still unknown. ‘They are not there to defend Dover!’ According to Richard Lewis, senior researcher at the Institute for European studies, the troops would mostly be there to assist local law enforcement with logistical issues such as traffic build-up, unloading goods and transporting essential medicines. ‘The important thing to remember is that these figures represent a contingency plan. It is true that the figure of 3.500 soldiers has been bandied around. But they are not there to defend Dover!’, says Lewis. £40.000 a year for one customs agent What about the increase of customs agents? Lewis thinks that Arena is undoubtedly on the right track here. ‘The figures are anywhere between 3.000 and 5.000 that might be needed, but here it depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations’, he states. The price tag of one customs agent according to Lewis? A hefty £40.000 a year. ‘It’s certainly a substantial sum of money and gives the lie to those in favour of Brexit who claim that it is a huge saving for the UK’, he claims. Marie Arena is correct on a lot of points. Military personnel and customs agents will be increased after the Brexit and citizens were only made aware of this as late as December 2018. Arena, however, does fail to address that the 3.500 troops would be used for logistical assistance, not for border security reasons. The cost for citizens is an often overlooked and essential downside of a Brexit scenario, which Arena successfully brings up. This leads us to conclude her statement is mostly true.

The article is based on a study from the German think tank CEP (Centre for European Policy) in which they researched whether the inhabitants of 8 Euro countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) have more money to spend now than before the euro was introduced as a currency. The original article shows us the following results:  The claim can be considered mostly false. The study shows “winners and losers” after 20 years of the euro. Some countries have seen a rise in prosperity per inhabitant while others have seen a (dramatic) reduction in prosperity per capita. The research conducted by CEP was considerably criticised by other academics. Liberal colour The study on which the article is based is of a strong neoliberal think tank. The chairman of the CEP (PROF. DR. LÜDER GERKEN ) is also chairman of the Friedrich-August-von-Hayek-Stiftung. Friedrich Hayek is a well-known political philosopher and economist of the twentieth century. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern day neoliberalism. Moreover, the German press also says that the CEP is considered quite liberal. As stated in the first lines of this article by Anja Ettel and Holger Zshäpitz from the German medium Die Welt: “The Freiburg Center for European Policy, CEP in short, a think tank known for their strict ordoliberal standpoint, has conducted research on the balance of the euro for every memberstate”. The way the research was conducted Their way of researching is not really waterproof. They work with control countries outside the euro zone and then compare the evolution of the GDPs with their corresponding eurozone countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain respectively. But Eurostat didn’t publish data on the GDP of the euro countries before 2009, yet the study says that they start comparing the euro countries with their control countries from the moment the euro was introduced which was way before 2009 and the researchers do not explain in their study how they might have gotten the data for the GDPs of the countries from any other source either. Eurostat probably has data on the GDP of each euro country from before 2009, but it was not published on their website when we checked. The study explains that the loss (or gain) of prosperity was calculated by assigning each of the 8 euro countries surveyed a number of control countries that had roughly the same evolution in GDP up to the point at which the euro was introduced. Then, on the basis of the evolution of the GDP of these control countries, it was calculated what the GDP of the euro countries could have been if they had not started using the euro as a currency. That way they could see whether the inhabitants of the euro countries would be “richer” or “poorer” without the euro. The problem here is the following: the control countries must meet a number of requirements, one of which is: “only countries that have not been affected by major country-specific shocks during the whole of the relevant period – 1980 to 2017 – can be considered as such shocks may distort the results”, according to the study. However, it never defines what such a “shock” is. Inadequate methodology This problem was also mentioned in the press. According to this opinion piece, by Marcel Fratzscher, member of the German institute for Economic Research (DIW). He considers the results of the study “not reliable” because the methodology is not suitable for the research. “The euro is not responsible for the debt crisis in Europe, but the mistakes of national governments”, he says. This remark by Marcel Fratzscher could mean that the way that the governments of each euro country choose to spend their budget has a bigger impact on the prosperity of said countries than the introduction of the euro itself. The article itself does not say that the euro is responsible for the debt crisis in the EU, but it can be interpreted as such, which would be incorrect according to Marcel Fratzscher. Even the president of the Munich Ifo Institute, Clemens Fuest, does not believe in the comparisons. The EU Commission also criticised the approach of the study. “A good analytical work and a robust methodology are a must to assess the causes of different policies and the development of the gross domestic product of a country”, said a spokesman for the Commission in Berlin. “The weak methodology of the CEP study is far from providing such solid analysis”, he added. Opinion of an expert: Paul De Grauwe We presented our factcheck to Paul De Grauwe, professor at KU Leuven and professor at the London School of Economics. He claimed that the journalist wrongly interpreted the study and therefore the title and the content of the article are false. “The Belgian has not become poorer since 1999 when the euro was introduced. The authors of this study concluded that Belgium’s per capita income has risen less rapidly than in this group of countries. There is a real difference between the control countries and Belgium’s per capita income of €6.370. But that doesn’t mean that the average Belgian citizen has become €6.370 poorer”, said De Grauwe. “On the contrary, according to The European Commission’s statistics (AMECO), the GDP per capita of Belgium rose from €29.300 in 1999 to €35.300 in 2018 (after adjustment for inflation), a real increase of €6.000,” concludes professor De Grauwe. Conclusion The opinions of experts like Marcel Fratzscher and Paul De Grauwe prove that multiple interpretations of CEP’s research are possible. The study itself was conducted correctly, but the interpretation of the study results by “Het Laatste Nieuws” was wrong. The Belgian citizen did not become poorer. Moreover Marcel Fratzscher’s opinion raises the question whether the introduction of the euro itself is the cause of these study results or whether it is more likely because of the way countries spend their budgets. We can assume that most of this claim is false. We didn’t find similar studies or numbers of other organisations.","https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welt.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fplus189459993%2FEuro-Steht-Deutschland-wirklich-besser-da-als-mit-der-D-Mark.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0ThdwhuiP4aUUkPPiJLM7Faoe1RPtpVIJvodYYmkZZ9RBH6xT7mDpOS28&h=AT2CXCRpsOSaEImrCopPL2PxCi86kQ1kzX6QCpjGfhgQ7gXya4bw2DTElHXaEXXbhOHlxExZJ5Lv7ceY1j-geJf5AHvc2jGeymEzNBeuC2RYshPMiJs3_Fe-hbUp9dvea_u9FTBMmorNiaoHWFj3pA,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tagesspiegel.de%2Fpolitik%2Fstudie-zur-gemeinschaftswaehrung-der-euro-hat-italiener-und-franzosen-aermer-gemacht%2F24028036.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0CLQRU3PhpynoJ36D1WPA-jax2FCAYzqcbb7Stedp9u20me5Ckk5TJNbc&h=AT3yUKWuGSYyXBBIzm6-qYZGit-rtf9lsAlEizOTJ87BNk6Y8m6EZi0-klkilksXxe-zKBW5rOLDLOo5S3lDnygRx7e2RjdOx0IHstJMEIdhzIYuoqV2_xmlkaAzw_OtBjkjdA,https://www.instagram.com/","“The Dutch have become considerably richer because of the euro, Belgians have become poorer”",,,,,,
135,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/optimism-is-mays-duty/,“Optimism is May’s duty”,2019-03-21,eufactcheck,,"At the end of February, British Prime Minister Theresa May posted a video on her Twitter profile containing a number of statements. She talked about increased employment, increased wages and reduced national debt. Research has shown that this is mostly true.  “We have more people at work than ever before.” A first thing Theresa May said, was “we have more people in work than ever before”. The British economy looks positive at the moment. People are at work, wages are rising and the British labour market continues to run. So there seems to be no problem. In addition, unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen. We see that in the graph below. In 2011, 8.1% of the British labour force was unemployed, in 2017 this had dropped to 4.4%. Unemployment in the UK is also low compared to the European Union. Graph: Emma Roose – Source: Eurostat To come back to May’s statement (“we have more people in work than ever before”), you cannot deny that she is right. Last year, 76.1% of the British workforce was employed, the highest employment rate in British history. Graph: Sybren Bruneel – Source: Office for National Statistics Even when we look back in time, there have never been more British people in work than in 2018. To sum up, the unemployment rate is falling and the employment rate is rising. There are actually more British people in work than ever before. So we can conclude that Theresa May’s statement is right. “We have wages growing at their fastest rate for a decade” As a second proposition, Theresa May mentions that today’s wages are growing at their fastest rate for a decade. This statement sounds very positive, but in reality it is a bit different. Graph: Astrid Vlaeminck – Source: Office for National Statistics; in 2015, a new index was drawn up and a new standard of 100 was created. But according to Samuel Tombs, economist to Pantheon Macroeconomics, it will be difficult for the wages to increase even more. “Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don’t lead to spiraling wage growth,” he said. May’s statement is therefore correct when she says that wages have been growing at the fastest pace over the past decade. But when we take inflation into account, this growth is a lot less spectacular than some would like to show. Real wage growth is thus rising less strongly than it appears at first sight. “A debt falling as a share of the economy” Has Britain’s public debt really fallen, as Theresa May claims? From Eurostat data, we see a clear trend from 2007 onwards: public debt is starting to rise sharply. In 2007 the debt was 41.9% of GDP and in 2010 it was 75.6%. We see that the most remarkable increase occurred in the period from 2008-2009 to 2009-2010. During this period, the debt rose from 52.6% of GDP to 69.6% of GDP (“Gov.uk”). Ever since, we see that debts are still rising but much more gradually than before. In 2015 and 2016, we see an absolute peak moment with the national debt at 88.2% of GDP (Eurostat). But in 2017, we see that the national debt gradually starts to decrease by 87.7% of GDP (Eurostat). On the website “Gov.uk” we can read that, last year too, the debts have fallen (85.8% of GDP in 2018 according to “www.ons.gov.uk”) and that this trend will continue, reaching 73% of GDP in 2023-2024. Compared to the peak moment in 2015-2016, this is still a significant decrease. In “De Volkskrant” Frank Kalshoven (economist and columnist) says that Great Britain, with its national debt now close to 90%, is in the danger zone. It is also said that as a result of this, the British treasury no longer has any room to significantly support economic growth in the coming period. But according to current trends, the national debt seems to be reduced. In other words: we see that the debt is still very high and was increasing until a few years ago, but has been stagnating for two years now. However, this stagnation is slow, but May has not lied when she says that the debts have fallen. If we look at the three statements made by Theresa May, we can conclude that we can only nuance the second statement. Because of this, the statements of May are mostly true.","https://twitter.com/theresa_may/status/1100416298851299329,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unempl-r-fc.png,https://eufactcheck.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cpi-fc.png,https://www.instagram.com/",“Optimism is May’s duty”,,,,,,
136,,,,F,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/false-the-increased-homophobia-in-the-netherlands-is-caused-by-uncontrolled-immigration-and-open-borders/,“The increased homophobia in The Netherlands is caused by uncontrolled immigration and open borders”,2019-03-19,eufactcheck,,"On March the 4th Dutch leader of the right-wing Forum for Democracy Thierry Baudet reacted to a statement by liberal politician Rob Jetten about homophobia in The Netherlands. Baudet stated on Twitter: ,,Jetten’s anger about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is justified, but he doesn’t see the causes: the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders his own political party D66 in particular stands for.” His claim about the causes for the increased homophobia is false.  In this factcheck we focus on the statement that ‘the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders’ are the causes of the ‘increased’ homo-hate crimes in The Netherlands. It is important to notice that Baudet doesn’t speak of any specific time or place. This is why we assume that he is talking about the general situation in The Netherlands in recent years.  Tweet by Thierry Baudet Baudet reacted to quotes in a lecture by his fellow Member of Parliament Rob Jetten, as reported by national public broadcaster NOS on 4 March. Jetten voiced concern about the emancipation of the LGBTQ-community in the Netherlands. He didn’t mention any increase of homophobia.  Because Baudet’s statement isn’t specified, checking it is difficult. To still be able to check his statement, we used several research reports about the nationality and ethnicity of suspects of homophobic crimes. Besides that, we also checked whether or not homophobia in The Netherlands has really increased.  The Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP) published a LGBTQ-study in November 2018. This study mainly concentrates on the living conditions of homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people in The Netherlands. An important statement reads: ,,Recent studies indicate that the attitude towards LGBTQ-people has become more positive between 2006/2007 and 2016/2017 (Kuyper 2018).” For this, the SCP used data of the Safety Monitor that is published by the Central Bureau of Statistics.  Besides LGBTQ-people feeling more safe throughout the years, they also mentioned having less experiences with homo-hate crimes. To conclude: the statement about the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is generally untrue. Bisexuals did mention a slight increase in experiences with homophobic crimes, but Baudet did not specify that. The LGBTQ-study doesn’t mention the ethnicity and social factors of the culprits. The organization MenEngage Europe does mention it in its factsheet about homophobia: ,,Those who are negative about homosexuality are mostly the elderly, the young, religious people and people from ethnical minority groups.” In 2015, the Dutch police published a study about homophobic crimes in The Netherlands. A notable fact: about 60 percent of the reported incidents took place in Amsterdam. The study doesn’t differentiate between non-immigrants and immigrants, but it does look at the nationality and birth country of the suspects. This study proves that 61.8 percent of the suspects has the Dutch nationality. To quote the study: ,,In 16.6 percent of the cases the suspect has the Moroccan nationality (possibly combined with the Dutch nationality). Besides that, 5.5 percent of the suspects has the Turkish nationality and 2.5 percent has the Romanian nationality. The nationalities that are even less frequent aren’t specified. In 11.5 percent of the cases it concerns a nationality that occurs less than four times.” In conclusion: the uncontrolled immigration and open borders are not the main causes of homophobia in The Netherlands. A different study from The Netherlands Institute for Social Research mentions the following: ,,The acceptance of homosexuality can be a sensitive subject for Syrians: less than a fifth fully or partly agrees with gay marriage. About half fully or partly agrees that the homosexuality of a child is problematic.” The study does prove that Syrians who have been in The Netherlands for a longer time have a more open attitude towards homosexuality.  Laurens Buijs from the University of Amsterdam published a study about the same subject in 2009. He proves that 36 percent of the suspects is of Dutch descent and that another 36 percent of the suspects is of Moroccan descent. This study shows that suspects of homo-hate crimes are just as much of Dutch descent as of Moroccan descent. To conclude: homophobic crimes aren’t caused anymore by ethnical minority groups than by people with the Dutch nationality.  Thierry Baudet’s statement about the uncontrolled immigration and the open borders as the cause of the increased homophobia in The Netherlands is false. This is mainly so because homophobia in The Netherlands hasn’t increased at all. Besides that, the studies above prove that the suspects of homophobic hate crimes are mostly people with the Dutch nationality.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

137,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-4000-eu-officials-are-paid-more-than-merkel/,"“4,000 EU officials are paid more than Merkel”",2019-03-15,eufactcheck,,"According to a Daily Express article, thousands of EU officials are earning more than 290.000 a year, which is more than German Chancellor Angela Merkel. We rate the claim as uncheckable.   The salaries of EU officials have been a wildly debated topic over the years. Last month, the Daily Express reported on the German nationalist party Alternative for Germany’s (AfD) election program for the upcoming European elections in May. The article describes how the AfD might push for a ‘dexit’ if the European Union is unable to fundamentally reform it’s operations. ‘According to the party, 44,000 EU officials and 11,000 employees cost over €8billion a year – 4,000 of those officials earn more than €290,000 a year, which is more than the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s salary’, the article cites.   Election program The source of the quotation is the German party’s election program (Leitantrag), where the claim is used as an argument to push for aggressive reforms: ‘Europe’s political classes have transformed the European Union into a monstrous administrative apparatus: twelve EU-institutions with 44.000 officials and 11.000 staff members, over 8 billion euros in personnel costs, and 24 EU-agencies with an undisclosed number of staff and service providers such as interpreters and experts. MEPs, commissioners, civil servants and other EU workers receive unduly high pay and privileges, from paradisiacal pension entitlements to tax-free allowances. In the EU, for example, some 4,000 EU officials earn more than the German Chancellor (€ 290,000 gross / year).’ Although the statements about the number and cost of EU workers are interesting as well, this factcheck focuses on the salary comparison.   Origin of the claim The AfD did not respond to our questions, so we did not get a direct answer regarding the basis of the statement. However, this 2013 press statement (in Dutch) from the European Commission specifically talks about the ‘4.000-claim’ and mentions a ‘calculation by Die Welt from 2012’. The article that the Commission is referring to is probably this one, although it’s dated 2013. The article bases the claim on calculations made by the British government. Former prime minister David Cameron made the initial claim at a 2012 press conference, saying that ‘more than 200 Commission staff earn more than I do without counting their allowances’, but does not say how he got to that number exactly.   Recalculation Die Welt recalculated the numbers and concluded that not hundreds, but thousands of EU workers ‘earn more than a typical European leader’ (note that this is not just about the salary of Angela Merkel). With all extras it should be possible to receive more than a prime minister from pay grade 13 up to 16. A senior official with a wife and child should have a gross salary of 16.358,80, about as much as a prime minister. According to the article in Welt, 4.365 officials are in pay grade 13 or higher.   Insufficient However, a monthly payment of 16.358,80 amounts to 196.305,60 per year, which falls short of the 290.000 that the AfD claims. And if 4.000 people earn about 196.000 per year, then the number of people who earn over 290.000 might be lower. 290.000 could be equal to the yearly salary of some European prime ministers, but does not match with what Angela Merkel actually gets paid. As a chancellor she receives 5/3 of pay grade B11, which is 23.595,55. On top of that, she gets paid as a deputy of the Bundestag and receives half of a monthly salary of a regular MP: 4.890,14. That amounts to 341.828,28 per year (WageIndicator comes up with 310.800, but the cause of the discrepancy is unclear).   Pay scales The EU works with a system of pay scales as well. Different function groups within the institutions have different scales, and each scale consists of multiple grades. Only the salaries in the salary scale for function group AD and AST (administrators and assistants) come close to the salary of Merkel. Before we start calculating, it is important to understand that salaries in the EU can vary greatly, even between people in the same pay grade. That’s because there are various compensations and allowances (and income remunerations, which we will discuss later). Whether a person is entitled to these extras is dependent on his or her personal situation (marital status, number of children, place of residence, etc.). The salary scale with the highest salaries. Source: European Commission   Example The highest basic salary an EU official can get in this scale is 20.219,80, but he or she can receive numerous allowances on top of that. If the official has a wife and two school-going kids and works outside his home country then the allowances are significant: an expatriation allowance of 2.260,94, a household allowance of 444,83, a dependent child allowance of 820,22, an education allowance of 1.113, and a daily subsistence allowance of 517,32 for the first half year. That builds up to 4.638,99 extra per month (without the subsistence allowance) and a total of 24.858,79, which is a total of 298.305,48 per year. The picture is not yet complete: there is compensation for travel costs (which can vary greatly per person) and various other allowances, but the most important ones are covered. The above example is enough to match the claimed 290.000 that Merkel supposedly receives, but not enough to reach what Merkel actually seems to earn.   How many? The European Commission publishes how many employees there are in each pay grade in it’s own organization. According to the statistics, 2.630 Commission employees are in grade 13 or up, but other EU institutions, like the European Parliament and the European Council, do not publish these numbers, so we cannot say whether the total number from Die Welt (4.635) is accurate. However, only 80 officials from the European Commission (which makes up about half of the total EU) are in pay grade 16.    Variation The problem with comparing salaries is that they differ on an individual level because of the different allowances. Furthermore, the EU has it’s own system of income remunerations to account for the difference in purchasing power between countries. For every 100 euros in salary paid in Belgium (the baseline), a Bulgarian will only receive 55,20, while a Brit will get 134,70 (because one euro will buy you more in Bulgaria than in the UK). If we use the same example as before: if our official is working in the UK then his salary is not 209.949,96 but actually 37,7% higher: 281.332,95. 8 out of the 26 countries with an income remuneration are higher than the baseline, which can increase the number of people who receive more than Merkel by a small amount.   Conclusion The scope of this factcheck is limited. We are not taking into account different taxing systems between the EU and Germany and have only looked at gross income, which is a limited way of comparing people’s salaries. Although these factors lie beyond our scope, it’s important to note that a better way of comparing salaries might be actual purchasing power in the individual countries. In the end, there is no concluding evidence that 4.000 officials (9,1%) are in the highest pay scale and step and receive all of the mentioned allowances. Even then it will be hard to equal the salary of Angela Merkel. But EU salaries vary from person to person, as there are a lot of personal variables that make up the total salary. Therefore we rate the claim as uncheckable.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

According to her, an addendum to the agreement does not comply with the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the adjacent waters of Western Sahara. The claim is not juridical, but political. Therefore, it is uncheckable. When buying Moroccan sardines or tomatoes in the supermarket, have you ever stopped to think where they might actually be from? Western Sahara is a disputed territory on the northwestern coast of the continent of Africa. It became a part of the Scramble for Africa when European powers such as France and the Great Britain divided the continent into colonies in the late 1800s. Western Sahara and a part of Morocco were occupied by Spain until 1975 when the Spanish military dictator Francisco Franco ceded the reign over Western Sahara to King Hassan II of Morocco. To this day, Western Sahara, also known as “Africa’s last colony”, is partially occupied by its neighbour, the Kingdom of Morocco. On 15 January 2019, Merja Kyllönen, Member of the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, tweeted: “Today, we are voting on an addendum to the EU-Morocco Agreement. I will vote against the addendum because it does not comply with the decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union that the agreement should not apply to the territories of the occupied Western Sahara without the consent of the Sahrawi people.”    Tweet by Merja Kyllönen, Finnish member of the European parlianment  Sounds complicated? No wonder, because the claim is a duplex. Kyllönen basically claims two things at the same time: 1) There is a decision made by the Court of Justice of the European Union according to which the EU-Morocco Agreement must not include the territories of the occupied Western Sahara without the consent of the Sahrawi people.2) The addendum to this agreement does not comply with the decision made by the Court of Justice. Kyllönen had linked her source, a report by Western Sahara Resource Watch, a network of organisations advocating the rights of the Sahrawi people, in her tweet. The Euro-Mediterranean free trade The European Union makes different kinds of agreements with non-EU countries. One aim of the agreements is to liberalise trade between the European Union and the counterparties. Such agreements have been made with countries in the Mediterranean area, such as with Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia (or the Maghreb countries), for example. The EU-Morocco Agreement concerns reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products. The question of the adjacent waters of Western Sahara has been the centre of many court cases In March 2012, the Council of the European Union decided to change some of the protocols in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement. See timeline at the bottom of this article The Polisario Front challenged this decision in the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Polisario is a Sahrawi national liberation movement aiming to end Moroccan presence in the territory of Western Sahara. The name of the movement comes from the Spanish words Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguia el Hamra y Río de Oro, which are the two main Sahrawi regions under Moroccan control. The EU Court of Justice decided in favour of the Polisario Front. The Council’s decision was annulled “in so far as it approves the application of that agreement to Western Sahara”. The Council then in turn, with a support of several countries and the European Commission, appealed to set aside the Court’s judgment in the Grand Chamber of the Court. Its decision was to support the Council’s appeal. Therefore, the previous decision made in favour of the Polisario Front was discarded. Both sides have been right at some point in the eyes of the Court of Justice.In July 2016, Western Sahara Campaign UK, an independent voluntary NGO, disputed the legality of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement and the Fisheries Agreement to the extent to which they apply to Western Sahara. In February 2018, the Grand Chamber of the of the Court decided that there was nothing that could affect making the agreement since it does not apply to the adjacent waters of Western Sahara. This is why the appeal was not accepted. How the Sahrawi advocates see it Kyllönen had linked the source of her claim in her tweet. It is a report made by Western Sahara Resource Watch, “an international network of organisations and activists researching and campaigning the companies working for Moroccan interests in occupied Western Sahara”. The report is in two parts: one is questioning the legality of the agreement, and the other is stating that consultation made by the European Union External Action was “fraudulent”. Here is one of the main points made in the report. “3. A discussion of the trade scheme’s potential benefits, which the Commission has put at the heart of its efforts to justify its proposal, cannot predate a decision by the people of Western Sahara as to whether they want a trade agreement in the first place.” This section summarises the standpoint of the Sahrawi: even if the agreement could bring wealth and development to the area, the Sahrawi people should have its right to be treated as a third party and have its voice heard in the decision-making process. In addition, according to the report, the consultation done by European Union External Action was biased towards Moroccan and European interests. WSRW states that some of the groups listed refused to take part in the consultation process, or were simply never invited. It is not clear if Western Sahara Resource Watch has the right to speak on behalf of the Sahrawi people. However, they have representatives in several countries and seem to be highly organised in their operations. According to their site, WSRW has established many campaigns relating to the use of natural resources in Western Sahara. The point of view of the European Union According to the Council of the European Union, the Fisheries Agreement is not contradictory to the previous decision made by the Court of Justice, our source in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland confirms. The Council also considers that all the concerns of the Court of Justice have been taken into account in the process of making the Fisheries Agreement. The European Union claims it has taken “all reasonable measures” to take Western Sahara into account in the negotiations. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what is exactly meant by “reasonable measures” in this instance. At the same time, the European Union declares to stand behind the UN decisions concerning the sovereignty of all peoples. The Article 73 of the United Nations Charter requires “members which have or assume responsibilities for the administration of territories whose peoples have not yet attained a full measure of self-government to develop self-government to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions.” Are EU’s words aligned with its actions? Is Western Sahara treated as a third party like it should be? Conclusion – the tale of two truths As we see it, the EU is very transparent in the decision-making. Its actions are not contradictory to the decisions made by the Court of Justice – technically speaking, at least.The case is not about the law, but about political views. We think that there are two contradicting truths, that of the Sahrawi and that of the European Union. Kyllönen bases her claim on a political source, whose accuracy is difficult, if not impossible, for us to evaluate. This claim is too complex to solve in this report, as there are two conflicting political interpretations. The controversy is not only about court rulings but also about principles: Who gets to determine what is good for Sahrawi people? Therefore, we think it is uncheckable.

His promise has turned out to be false. The immigration issue in Matteo Salvini’s political campaign  Immigration was one of the most covered issues of Matteo Salvini’s political campaign in early 2018. According to him, setting arrivals by sea to zero and increasing the number of repatriated migrants was a priority for the country’s welfare. Long before becoming Minister of the Interior, Salvini already spotted some essential conditions to achieve his goals. First of all, he said, it was necessary to increase the number of the Identification and Expulsion Centres and to make the management of immigration shelters more transparent. In addition, he said he wanted to build other shelters under UN protection in Libya, to close more bilateral agreements for repatriation, to stop NGO ships’ arrivals to Italy and to change the procedures for refugee status’ recognition or revocation. Also, Matteo Salvini promised several times that he would send back to their countries 100.000 people per year, a number he lowered just a few months after his election. How Salvini’s promises changed through the years  On 26th November 2017, now-Italian Minister of the Interior said: “If elected, the centre-right government must guarantee 100.000 expulsions per year, in order to get half a million irregular migrants back to their countries in five years”. Not much later, on 11th December, he said again he would have asked his allies to sign an agreement on these numbers. But no more than a year later, on 28th September 2018, Salvini said something very different: it would have been easy, he told the press, to send back to their homeland at least 4.000 people per year. Figures published by the Ministry of the Interior show that 2.833 people have been returned to their countries in the first semester of 2018 (1st January – 31st May) while from 1st June to 31st December, under League-5 Stars Movement cabinet, the number has risen to 3.626. Altogether, 6.459 people have been expulsed from Italy in the whole 2018, more than the 4.000 promised in September 2018 but far less than the 100.000 promised in 2017. Furthermore, according to latest data from Eurostat (Eu’s office for statistics) only 16.899 of 530.000 irregulars  have left Italy between 2015 and 2017, while expulsion injunctions amount to 95.910. This means the number of people actually sent away from the country is far less than it should.   Matteo Salvini versus Marco Minniti Lots of comparisons have been made in Italy between Matteo Salvini and the former Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti (Democratic party). The immigration bill signed from Minniti in 2017 led to an expansion of the shelter facilities. In replacement of the four existing Cie (Centres for identification and expulsion) the government created twenty “Cpr”, permanent facilities for repatriation, one for each region. Altogether they can host 1600 people, for a total cost of 19 million euros. The Conte cabinet, in charge from June 2018, approved the so-called “Decreto sicurezza” (Security bill), which expanded the maximal stay in the Cprs from 90 to 180 days. The bill also establishes that, in case of no place available in those facilities, migrants can be detained in the border offices. In addition, it raises the funds stored for repatriation, although they are being invested from the government in a very new way: if the former cabinet wanted to launch a plan to encourage voluntary repatriation, the actual Minister is keen to spend this funds for sending migrants to their countries, whichever the way.  Why repatriating migrants is so hard  There are two different kinds of repatriation: voluntary repatriation and forced repatriation. The UNHCR (United Nations’ High Committee for Refugees) sponsors the first one, encouraging instruments like the geo-and-see, short stays of the refugees in their homeland to consider the safety conditions. A plan of voluntary repatriation was put into effect worldwide in 2015, but it’s still not an option for a lot of migrants due to conflicts in their native countries, which put on place different risks and threats. Apart from UNCHR, there are various non-profit-organizations that deal with repatriating migrants that could be reintegrated in their homelands. These associations usually guarantee a plane ticket and a funding of €2000 to start a business. In Italy, the AVR (Assisted Voluntary Return), financed the assisted return of 270 citizens from Colombia, Ecuador, Perù, Morocco, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal. In 2017, CIES (Centre for Information and Development of Education), CIR (Italian Centre for Refugees) and GUS (Human Solidarity Group) developed three different programs funded by EU and the Ministry of the Interior’s Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, bringing back home almost 300 migrants from different countries in North Africa. Forced repatriation, instead, depends on several laws and bills that tried to regulate its procedure, such as the so-called “Minniti-Orlando” bill on immigration (that includes, among other measures, the increasement of the shelters’ net and the introduction of voluntary work for migrants). Both voluntary and forced repatriations share the same huge problem: they are really expensive (from Euro 3,000 to Euro 5,000 per person, due to charter flights and safety measures), as was iconically shown in 2006, when 29 Tunisian citizens were repatriated at a cost of Euro 115,000 for the Italian government. For the year 2019, the Ministry of the Interior allocated Euro 1.5 million, an amount sufficient to cover just 500 travels. But it’s not only money: time is also a much-needed resource. Talking about arrivals from Tunisia, Matteo Salvini said that we would need 8 years to repatriate the 4,000 migrants illegally landed in Italy. It is to be seen if this statement can be considered an admission of how difficult is the management of this repatriation system in terms of money and time. In conclusion, Matteo Salvini had promised to repatriate 100,000 migrants per year, but in his first six months of government he only sent back 3,626. Therefore, his promise is false.

We rate the claim as mostly false.  According to Havenaar, high voter turnout is indicative of ‘a solid foundation, something current doomsday thinkers fail to recognize’. An average turnout of up to 80 percent is indeed impressive, but does the statistic hold up?   Source The article is a prepublication of the historian’s latest book, Naar de bliksem, maar nu nog niet (‘Going to hell, but not yet’), published on 7 February. The claim is repeated in the book and provides a source book (Ruling the Void by Peter Mair), which states that the average turnout across western Europe fell from 81.7 percent to 77.6 percent in the 1990s, and to 75.8 in the 2000s. But this is the average in western Europe, so is a limited statistic, and it’s the average between 2000-2010. That might not be long ago, but as the source book points out: ‘The more recent the elections, the more likely they are to record troughs in participation.’ That’s why it’s crucial to use the most recent turnout statistics.   Databases The source book itself uses multiple sources to back up the statistics: two books from 2002 (which will lack recent turnout numbers), and multiple online election databases that are managed by various organizations: Parlgov, a website run by the University of Bremen keeps track of European election statistics. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international partnership of parliaments, also keeps track of those numbers. And there’s the International IDEA, which supports the development of democracies around the world. The latter has a voter turnout database with elaborate turnout statistics. International IDEA usually pulls its statistics directly from national reports and official announcements. We used these databases to calculate the most recent average voter turnout at national elections (our calculations can be downloaded here).According to these statistics, average voter turnout in Europe is 64.9 percent. That’s between 5.1 and 15.1 percent lower that the claimed 70 to 80 percent. The average for western Europe is 71,9%.   !function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement(""script"");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");   A report from International IDEA from december 2016 also shows that there has been a steady decline in European voter turnout since the end of the 1980s, which amounts to around 20 percent. It is a worldwide phenomenon, but the decline in Europe is greater than in other parts of the world. Around 1995 the average turnout dipped below 70 percent.   Established vs. post-communist Furthermore, the report distinguishes between ‘established European democracies’ like Denmark and Spain, and ‘post-communist countries’ like Hungary and Serbia. The reason for the distinction is because voter turnout in the second category is declining faster than in the first one. ‘The decline in Europe is disproportionately due to the sharp fall in voter turnout in the post-communist countries’, the report states. The established European democracies show a decline of 10 percent, which is half of the continent’s average.   Causes The report provides a number of explanations for the declining numbers. For instance, the enthusiasm for elections may be higher in a ‘new’ democracy and slowly decrease for subsequent elections. General disappointment in the democratic system could also be at play. Into the Void, Havenaar’s source book, states other possible causes, like generational shifts and ‘sheer boredom’. These are possible factors; the report is not able to give a definitive answer.   Conclusion In his publication, Havenaar argues that Europe is stronger than we might think and that there is no reason to be drawn into doomsday scenarios. One of his arguments is the high turnout at national elections. But although the turnout is still not unsubstantial, the statistic seems to be a bit too optimistic.

141,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-62-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-released-during-extraction-processing-and-manufacturing/,"“62% of greenhouse gas emissions released during extraction, processing and manufacturing”",2019-02-26,eufactcheck,,"The claim is backed by an actual study, but experts suggest the exact percentages are difficult to determine. On 23 January 2019, Mari Pantsar, the Director of carbon-neutral circular economy of Sitra, a Finnish Innovation Fund, claimed on Twitter: “A 1.5 degree world can only be “circular.” That’s why the #circulareconomy has to be placed at the core of climate policy. A total of 62% of the global greenhouse gas emissions are released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods, 38% are emitted in the delivery and use of products and services. #climatechange”    A screenshot from the tweet by Mari Pantsar  Climate change has provoked a lot of public discussion in Finland after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its large report last year. The country is currently heading towards both general and European elections, and the politicians’ position on climate change is expected to be one of the main issues affecting people’s voting behaviour. Pantsar’s tweet brings the less-often mentioned role of circularity into this discussion. The circular economy, which Pantsar is talking about in her tweet, is an economic system that aims to minimise waste. In a circular system products are reused and recycled rather than thrown away and the manufacturing and consumption of products produces as little emissions and waste as possible. Sitra is an innovation fund controlled by the Finnish Parliament. One of its goals is to build a sustainable Finland for the future by focusing on carbon neutral circular economy. In her tweet Pantsar refers to The Circularity Gap report by Circle Economy and the press release linked to it. The claim is based on an authoritative, quantitative study by Circle Economy. Circle Economy is a social enterprise based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The enterprise receives funding from several, mainly Dutch foundations and organizations including the Nationale Postcode Loterij (the biggest charity lottery in the Netherlands), Adessium Foundation (a privately funded public-benefit organisation), and De Hoge (a private equity firm). Its stated mission is “to accelerate the practical and scalable implementation of the circular economy”. The research was based on life cycle analysis: for example, the amount of energy used extracting the materials from the country, emissions caused by the operation itself, and by the manufacturing process of the product. Our consumption causes a lot of emissions “In 2017, the total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding land use and forestry) were 50.9 bln tonnes of CO2 equivalent including: 12.5 bln from extraction; 10 bln from processing; 9.3 bln from production; 6.5bln from delivery of products and services; and 12.7 bln caused by consumption“, says The Circularity Gap report. Circle Economy bases its analysis mostly on the report by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, an autonomous research institute which is also part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure. Along with researching and publishing reports related to ecology, environment and economy, the institute advises the Dutch government on these matters. According to the agency, there is some uncertainty when it comes to the global greenhouse gas emission estimates. The uncertainty is estimated at 10%. The agency also states that effects of forestry and land use have been excluded from the calculations. The Finnish Climate Change Panel is an independent think tank. The work of the panel is based on the Finnish Climate Change Act and it aims to bring science and decision-making together. Its chairperson, professor Markku Ollikainen, says that greenhouse gas emissions cannot be calculated this precisely. “These numbers come with uncertainties. They are for sure just rough estimates.’’ In short, greenhouse gas emissions cannot probably be calculated with this degree of accuracy. Pantsar’s tweet itself does not include the fact that effects of forestry and land use has been excluded from the calculations of The Circularity Gap report.

142,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-the-quote-given-by-the-russian-news-agency-regnum-is-not-correct/,the quote given by the Russian news agency Regnum is not correct,2019-02-25,eufactcheck,,"According to a REGNUM news agency report, on January 13, Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s “National Unification” party, made a statement regarding the way out of the political crisis, but if we will turn to politician’s Twitter, an interpretation, given by Regnum can be considered as MOSTLY FALSE. LITTLE BIG INACCURACY In her tweet post, dated by January 13, Marine Le Pen, withstood her speech, but there is one omission in translation into Russian. Marine Le Pen claimed that “In the context of the popular revolt of the Yellow Vests, these #Europeans2019 offers the opportunity to untie the political crisis born from blindness, intransigence, class contempt, tax spoliation and the human disconnection from President”. The last word is of great importance for the understanding of the whole phrase. The Russian agency interpreted it in it’s own way: “In the context of a revolt of “yellow vests” this elections will become an opportunity to extinguish a political crisis, irreconcilability, class contempt, dissociation of people“. Tax spoliation is not mentioned at all.  The difference is surprising. In her statement Marine Le Pen said that the upcoming elections WILL GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY to resolve the political crisis that was born <…>. The Regnum agency misinterprets the meaning, saying that these elections will resolve a political crisis, intransigence, class disdain and DISUNITY. It is worth paying attention to the last word, since in the origin the party leader says that people are disunited with the president. The Russian media reports that people cannot find common ground between themselves. Such an inaccuracy in translation in the condition of language ignorance is a big media misstep. FOCUS ON DATA The information also mentiones the number of supporters, presented at the event: 2000. According to Le Monde, there were about 1,500 supporters. Inaccuracies indicate some lack of professionalism or deliberate falsification of facts.

143,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-foods-within-the-european-union-are-traceable-all-along-the-supply-chain/,“Foods within the European Union are traceable all along the supply chain”,2019-02-25,eufactcheck,,"At a press conference on July 11, 2018, the European Commission stated: “Foods within the European Union are traceable all along the supply chain.” This assertion is partly true. This was a response to Thilo Bode, founder of the non-governmental organization Foodwatch, which fights for consumer protection; he had questioned the president of the European Commission about recent food scares. In theory, foods in circulation in the European Union are of course traceable. But in reality, it doesn’t always work this way. Tracing food from farming to being sold is not that simple Traceability is a way of marking goods, from farming to being sold as food in the marketplace. All stages of production, transformation, and distribution are verified in accordance with Regulation 178/2002 of the European Parliament and Council. Agricultural and industrial producers alike should be able to identify anyone that has supplied them with a food item. Likewise, they should be able to identify any substance intended to be incorporated or likely to be incorporated in prepared dishes. Moreover, European law requires manufacturers to ensure that product packaging precisely labels the sources of products. For example, these producers must be able to trace the provenance of the raw materials they use. Distributors must also identify all of their suppliers. Traceability in Europe: An interactive system In April 2004, the European Commission established TRACES (Trade Control and Expert System), an online platform for certifying all food products, particularly as they are moved around and imported into Europe. Manufacturers must use it to log the health safety certificates that accompany the movements of animals or animal products. With this information, the TRACES platform makes it possible to send an electronic notification from the starting point to the destination, and any relevant points in between, that merchandise or living animals will arrive. Each intermediate point also notifies any other interested participants, making the system interactive. Video presenting TRACES – Source: European Commission Products must also be checked on a national basis. In France, this is carried out by the Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs, and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), as well as the Directorate General for Food (DGAL). These institutions serve as an additional control. In short : All foods within the European Union are therefore traceable, but there is a margin between traceability and actually being traced. So the claim of UE is mostly true beacause in theory foods in circulation in the European Union are of course traceable…  ——————————— Context : Foods may be traceable, but European authorities failed to detect the presence of bacteria in contaminated milk from Lactalis According to several NGOs, recent incidents of food contamination, such as when eggs were contaminated with fipronil, show that this traceability is far from guaranteed. In the words of Ingrid Kragl, director of public information for the NGO Foodwatch: “Recent health safety scandals illustrate that, although traceability must be ensured, foods are not being traced. The authorities spend a great deal of time locating the contaminated batches. There is also a layer of opacity: consumers don’t have access to detailed information, such as the relevant brands and manufacturers.” “Food scares that have affected France” – via Statista (c) Pascaline Boittiaux “Authorities have not determined the number of eggs contaminated by the insecticide fipronil—they are in the millions—or the precise locations where they were distributed,” according to a press release from Foodwatch. Foods may be traceable, but European authorities failed to detect the presence of bacteria in contaminated milk from Lactalis, or more recently, the presence of genetically modified organisms normally prohibited in certain foods. The goods are indeed traceable, but they are not always traced.   Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

144,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-catalan-public-media-lacks-objectivity-and-pluralism/,“Catalan public media lacks objectivity and pluralism”,2019-02-22,eufactcheck,,"In recent years, public media in Spain have been questioned because they are commonly accused of serving particular political tendencies. In the case of the Catalan public broadcasting, the claim arrived to the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament in January 2019. Two complainants accused the Catalan public television (TV3) and radio station (Catalunya Radio), of “lacking objectivity and pluralism”. Their claims turn out to be mostly false.   Scrutinizing those claims is central in the run-up to the forthcoming European elections. The petitions made in the European Parliament Commission included certain information that should be thoroughly verified. At the same time, it is important to explain who are the people behind those petitions. The complainants, C.E.R. and Sergio Santamaría, had previously been members of the conservative party Partido Popular (PP) and had even participated in their electoral lists.   Partido Popular (PP) and other non-separatist parties have repeatedly denounced the political bias of TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio. However, data from Center for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom show that the media system in Spain has a high risk on receiving political influence, reporting cases in TV3 but also in the Spanish public broadcasting, TVE, and other Spanish private news outlet like El País. In fact, the News Council of TVE has also registered a petition in the European Parliament reporting political influence in its own channel.   Why has Partido Popular (PP) set TV3 as an object of their complaint? Non-separatist parties have focused on denouncing TV3 due its importance in the Catalan territory. TV3 is the broadcasting leader in Catalonia in contrast to all the Spanish news outlets, which turns the Catalan public media into the most significant broadcasting station in the territory. It is also the only public-owned news outlet headquartered in Barcelona.    Petitions registered in the European Parliament Commission The debate of the two petitions against TV3 took place on 22nd January 2019, with the participation of the petitioners but also of Lluís Caelles, the President of the Professional Commission of TV3, some European MPs and other experts. Both petitions are still open and therefore, verifying the facts can contribute to the investigation. You will find the petitioners’ facts checked hereunder.  “On the October 2nd 2017, there was a broadcast for children. They showed the referendum of October 1st saying that the police who were trying to ensure the rule of law were the ‘baddies’ basically and the people who were trying to cover up the ballot boxes were the ‘goodies’”. FALSE  On the October 2nd, TV3’s news bulletin addressed to children, InfoK, talked about the 1-O referendum, coinciding with the International Day of Non-Violence. The program was focused on the incidents occurred the day before, describing the images of violence as “people quarrelling”, talking about “peace” and “democracy”. They also covered how schools dealt with children’s concerns about adult’s behaviour, who “do not agree with each other”, and the flaws caused by the violence in polling stations and schools. Just in one occasion, InfoK indicated that the Spanish police used excessive force and violence to enter the polling places and injured several people.    “We have the speech made by the ex-President Puigdemont, already dismissed from his position, who was presented on the Catalan public television as if he was still the Catalan President, when he’s not […] Meanwhile, the speech of the Spanish monarch was omitted, as it happens every year”. FALSE  TV3 presented Carles Puigdemont as the Catalan President just one time after being quitted by the Spanish government. It was a video published 24 hours after his removal, which was retrieved from a previous broadcast. On the other hand, TV3 has never omitted the speech of King Felipe VI. Since 2017, the speeches made by the monarch have been relegated to the 24-hour news channel of the media group, Canal 3/24, in order to do not interrupt the evening news bulletin, where they broadcast minutes later its main points. In fact, there is no legal obligation to air his speech. The Basque television (EiTB) does not broadcast it either.    “The distribution in the debates is usually in favour of those panellists who are pro-independence against those who are defending the rule of law”. FALSE  TV3 has been denounced for its lack of plurality. Despite this, data from the Catalan Audiovisual Council prove that TV3 is one of the most plural broadcasters in Spain. Here you can see the time percentage dedicated by TV3 to each political party during the last elections in Catalonia, in contrast to La1, Telecinco and Antena 3.     “We also have the warnings that these professionals have received from neutral organisms such as Junta Electoral Central (JEC), integrated by magistrates that supervise and control the functioning and legality of TV3”. FALSE  The JEC is an organism composed by eight judges of the Supreme Court and five law professors proposed by the political parties. So is not as “neutral” as the petitioners said. At the end of 2017 and before the Catalan elections of December 21st, this organism prohibited TV3 from using expressions such as “imprisoned councillors” to speak of the government dismissed by the application of article 155 of the Spanish constitution following the referendum on October 1.    “There have been pressures on magistrates of the supreme court. Judge Pablo Llarena himself and his family have seen how television programs published private data of themselves that have materialized in violent actions”. FALSE  “Tot es Mou” is the program where the 26th March this data about Llarena was released. The day before this program, Llarena’s house in the Pyrenees had been painted yellow by the youth organisation Arran. In November last year, Arran painted Llarena’s house in Sant Cugat, but it cannot be said that these actions were triggered by the information about him shown in TV3, because the Arran’s campaign against the judge had started before this personal data was published. For this reason, the CAC exculpated TV3 for this accusation.    “On a TV3 program, the president of Spain was compared with Hitler. What public television of Europe would Nazism be banalized? On what public television would you compare a democratic leader to the biggest genocide in Europe? That has happened on TV3!”. FALSE    “Polonia” is not a news programme, but a comedy program characterized by caricaturing the political reality. This caricature of former President Rajoy appeared on November 12th, 2012, after the 9N vote, which the Spanish government argued had not been carried out and was unconstitutional. The gag recreated the famous Downfall’s Bunker scene, a recurring scene in parodies, also used by the BBC in a parody of Tony Blair.   In conclusion, the Spanish media framework must be taken into consideration when it comes to analysing the editorial independence of public media since it is very different from other models such as the British one. In Spain, public media depend economically on institutions, which also makes them less independent when it comes to developing a completely autonomous editorial line. However, and beyond this assessment, we must differentiate between editorial line and informative content.

145,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-kosovos-import-tariffs-are-a-clear-violation-of-cefta/,“Kosovo’s import tariffs are a clear violation of CEFTA”,2019-02-12,eufactcheck,,"The Dutch newspaper Trouw published an article on February 1st about import tariffs of 100 percent on Serbian products like milk. According to Trouw, this is problematic, since the imposed tariffs are – according to the EU – a direct violation of the regional Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). Our findings suggest this is mostly true.  This claim is based on a statement of Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman of the EU’s foreign policy chief Mogherini. According to a Reuters article from November 7th , she said: “These measures (the import tariffs, ed.) are a clear violation of Kosovo’s obligations under CEFTA.” Also, on December 19th, the European Commission answered a parliamentary question on that subject as follows: ‘the decisions of the Kosovo government to increase up to 100% the tax on goods from Serbia … are a clear violation of CEFTA.’        The statement of the European Commission on the imposed tax increase. Source: Reuters      This recent disagreement between the EU and Kosovo is surprising. Only last summer, the Union initiated talks between the decade-old country and neighbour Serbia, that still considers Kosovo as a southern province rather than an independent state. Also, Kosovo’s capital Pristina hosted the CEFTA Week last December – an event to discuss the state of the trading agreement in a changing world economy.   Import tariffs But, why are there tariffs on Serbian goods? In November, Kosovo’s government imposed the import tariffs of 10 and later 100 percent on Serbian products after the country’s bid to join Interpol failed. Immediately after the failed attempt, Kosovo’s government stated that a ‘fierce campaign of the Republic of Serbia once again proved its character against Kosovo and against the idea of normalizing relations with the Republic of Kosovo’. So, according to the government, Serbia actively lobbied against the attempt to become an Interpol member. Kosovo’s Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has stated that he will only lift the tariffs when Serbia finally recognizes Kosovo as an independent state.   CEFTA According to EU spokeswoman Kocijancic, the imposed tariffs are a ‘clear violation’ of the CEFTA trade agreement between Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo. Macedonia, Albania and Moldova; all countries that aspire EU membership in the near future. The trade agreement was set up for former communist countries, so they could harmonize their economic and legal systems with EU demands. Since its creation in 1992, countries like Hungary and Romania left the agreement after they acquired full EU membership.   Customs and tariffs The CEFTA trade agreement is an extensive document consisting of an original agreement signed in 1992 and multiple amendments, the most recent dating from 2006. In this last amendment, called ‘CEFTA 2006’, the member countries are bound by articles concerning customs for importing and exporting products. One of the aims of the trade agreement is ‘the simplification and facilitation of customs procedures’, which is in accordance with Article 14.4 of the agreement. A subcommittee ensures that ‘Parties shall reduce, as far as possible, the formalities imposed on trade’, as stated in the Article. The original agreement, signed in 1992 in Poland, states clearly in Article 5 that ‘no new charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Parties.’        Article 5 of the CEFTA agreement. Source: CEFTA agreement, 1992      According to the Business Directory, duties are introduced to ‘raise state revenue or to protect domestic industries from more efficient or predatory competitors from abroad’. Haradinaj and his government stated that the recent tariffs are not only used to ‘protect local goods’, but they also serve as protection for their sovereignty:        Official statement on the imposed tariffs. Source: Official website of the Office of the Prime Minister of Kosovo      Based on these statements, Kosovo’s import taxes on Serbian products have an effect similar to that of a customs duty.   National security In spite of the aforementioned Articles, Prime Minister Haradinaj states that his government is on the right side of the argument. Article 18 of the original 1992 version of CEFTA says that the ‘agreement shall not preclude the prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports, or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security.’        Article 18 of the CEFTA agreement. Source: CEFTA agreement, 1992      This basically means that the government of Kosovo can put tariffs in place if they think the security of the country and its people are in danger. On December 3, Haradinaj stated on his Facebook page that the tariffs ‘have the function of protecting national sovereignty and national security and are in compliance with CEFTA.’        Explanation of the imposed tariffs. Source: Official Facebook Page of Kosovo PM Haradinaj        Conclusion This discussion doesn’t seem to have a clear winner. It is not clear whether the argument of Haradinaj and his government, that Kosovo needs to be protected from ‘continuing obstacles that Serbia is making to our country’, will hold. Since the Serbian government already demanded the organization behind CEFTA to resolve the ‘tax problem’ in November, it is still not known which action can be taken. In the meantime, Serbia threatens to start a legal process in an arbitration court if CEFTA fails to end the trade conflict. So in the end, the question if Kosovo is in violation of the agreement might only be answered in an arbitration court in the near future. But, based on the Articles in CEFTA that promote free trade we conclude that the claim is mostly true. Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.

This claim turned out to be mostly true. “From a study done by European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) it turns out that the health damages by road traffic related air pollution costs the European Union around 62 billion euros a year. These health damages include sicknesses that are directly linked to air pollution such as cardiac arrests and respiratory illnesses.“ Table from the EPHA study on the costs of air pollution. The 13-billion-euro margin is due to the use of different calculation methods. When using TRUE-based factors, the costs are 20% higher than when using COPERT as calculating criteria. The multiple-billion-euro gap between calculation methods is quite large. Belgian bio-engineer professor Roeland Samson of the University of Antwerp, specialist in air pollution, does not question the credibility of the study. “The use of different calculation methods means that they use different factors, and different data to calculate the costs of the effects of these emissions. It is quite normal to achieve very different results from using different methods.” “Even though a 20% margin between the two calculating methods seems significant, in research of such a large scale it is quite normal to obtain differences like these. The results of the study, while not absolute, are an orientation of the costs of traffic related emissions and are troublesome to say the least.” Welfare costs Professor Luc Int Panis (University of Hasselt and Flemish Institute for Technological Research), specialist in mobility and health research, agrees that the 20% margin between the calculation methods is not that significant for such a large-scale study, he finds however that the results of the EPHA study are quite low. “Coming from an NGO you would expect their results to be higher and more shocking, to make a statement. In a study performed by the OECD they found that welfare costs from premature deaths due to air pollution amount up to 730 billion US dollars which is roughly 644 billion euros, in Europe alone. These results however were probably obtained by a different calculation method.” Professor Int Panis concludes that the results of the EPHA study are not absolute but are also hard to check due to there not being many other studies of such a large scale. Table from the OECD study on the economic consequences of outdoor air pollution. In short, while the study’s credibility is hard to check due to its incomparable large-scale research, the air pollution experts believe that the results of the EPHA study are most likely a correct estimate of the costs of health problems due to traffic related air pollution.

147,,,,U,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/uncheckable-conventional-menstrual-pads-are-made-up-of-90-plastic-materials/,“Conventional menstrual pads are made up of 90% plastic materials”,2019-02-07,eufactcheck,,"The Natracare brand of organic skin protection claims on its website that conventional menstrual pads are made of “90% plastic”. An unverifiable figure, but likely.   “Did you know conventional menstrual pads are made up of 90% plastic materials?!” The brand Natracare, a pioneer in organic sanitary pads, uses this astounding figure to appeal to potential customers on its website. That’s because, unlike the major brands Nana, Always, and Vania, Natracare makes feminine hygiene products out of cotton and uses zero plastic. They’re not the only company to do so: in the last few years, Jho, Naty, and Love & Green have also entered the burgeoning trade in organic pads. They all position themselves in relation to mainstream brands by playing up the eco-friendliness and the “healthy” aspect. These brands believe that plastic is especially bad for the environment and for women’s health, being derived from petroleum. But the figure cited by Natracare—that conventional pads are 90% plastic—is quite vague. Nevertheless, as will be shown, this is still probable. There are indeed several plastic materials found in all layers of the pad, even in the thickest and most absorbent products. “Conventional menstrual pads are made up of 90% plastic materials,” says Natracare. © Natracare No quantities disclosed Where does the brand get this information? When contacted, they do not reveal their sources, nor do they specify if the 90% figure refers to the number of components in a pad or to its weight. Let’s assume this is referring to the number of components. Nana, Always, and Vania, the three giants among “conventional” sanitary pad makers, could not be reached for comment. On their websites, however, they provide summary lists of ingredients. With Nana, there is plastic in the first layer (non-woven material made of polypropylene, or a blend of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyester), the second layer (polyester fibers), the absorbent core (superabsorbents), and in the fourth layer (polyethylene coating). No quantities are given, and the term “superabsorbent” is not explained. With Vania products, according to the magazine 60 Millions de Consommateurs (EN: 60 Million Consumers), there is plastic in the top sheet, the absorbent core, and in the bottom layer. © Vania   With Vania and Always, it’s quite similar. Even the magazine 60 Millions de Consommateurs, which examined the question in 2016, does not offer any other specifics. They claim to have analyzed the composition of sanitary pads available in France, and attempted, “not without difficulty,” to establish an exhaustive list of their raw materials. But the components are identical to those listed on the brands’ websites. Once again, no figures are available, and the magazine could not be reached for comment. However, according to Clément Perrin, a second-year doctoral candidate in the physical chemistry of polymers at the University of Lyon I, the “90%” figure provided by Natracare is “very probable.” He says there is plastic in almost all layers of the pad. Even in the absorbent core, whose composition is never specified, except that it contains “superabsorbents.” This term is used as a shortened form of “superabsorbent polymers,” but according to Perrin, there is only one superabsorbent polymer: polyacrylate. “This is a petroleum derivative, meaning a plastic,” the PhD student explains. Data on chemical substances, but not plastic What do government agencies say about this? ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail; the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) published a report on the composition of feminine hygiene products in June 2018. This document is available on its website. But here again, no figures are given about the presence of plastic in pads. The information is more or less the same as that provided by the companies. According to Aurélie Mathieu, director of scientific projects at the ANSES Risk Assessment Directorate, the agency does not have these numbers. “Companies were not asked to provide this information. The goal was to assess the safety of products from a chemical standpoint,” she explains. Why is it so difficult to access this information? In fact, at the European level, sanitary pad manufacturers are not required to release an exhaustive list of their components—even less so their proportions, then. On February 29, 2016, the MEP of the Europe Ecology – The Greens party Michèle Rivasi appealed to the European Commission on this issue. On May 13, the Commission responded: as feminine hygiene products, according to several scientific studies, did not pose any health risks, they could not require manufacturers to make their ingredients public. To date, then, in order to find out if the figure cited by Natracare is exact (that plastic materials represent 90% of the weight of non-organic sanitary pads), one would have to order a new chemical analysis to be definitively certain. However, given that plastic is found in all layers of standard pads, it is possible that plastic materials represent a very large proportion of their components. In short : We hesitated a lot with the mostly false rating. Some of our group wanted it to be “mostly false”. But ” the “90%” figure provided by Natracare is “very probable.” but not 100% sure… It is uncheckable and we know our reader will make their own opinion.

148,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-true-the-way-facebook-works-is-simple-the-more-money-you-spend-the-wider-your-audience/,“The way Facebook works is simple,2019-02-05,eufactcheck,,"During elections, some candidates buy advertisements on Facebook to increase the visibility of their posts. Some see this as necessary to gain the upper hand in an election. In an election period, do wealthy candidates have an advantage thanks to Facebook? “The way Facebook works is simple: the more money you spend, the wider your audience. For 10 euros, the post reaches 30,000 people, and for 100 euros, it reaches 300,000. The candidate with the deepest pockets has all the odds in their favor.” José Bové, Green MEP, December 14, Libération Social networks have become essential tools during election periods. The content promotion offered by Facebook can sometimes undermine the equality of visibility among the various parties. In his editorial, José Bové makes three assertions. According to him, the more money a user spends to promote content on Facebook, the more people they reach. The MEP also supposes that the relationship is linear (i.e. the reach of extra views is proportional to the amount spent), and that the candidate with the most money has the best chance in an election. José Bové’s column doesn’t cite any sources, so it will be impossible to debate the figures put forward; rather we can discuss the linear relationship they imply. Paying to Increase Visibility The first two details can be verified very quickly. By testing two Facebook pages with 49,000 and 1,000 followers respectively, Facebook offers the option to pay to increase the visibility of content, estimating the reach of extra views per day (see the graphs below). The social network identifies a range of people that would be reached by promoting a certain post. For example, spending €100 on a page with 1,000 followers can increase its visibility by between 31,000 and 200,000 people. The two graphs reveal that the more you spend, the higher the added reach of the content, confirming Bové’s first statement. The second assertion, however, is false: the relationship between cost and reach seems more logarithmic than linear. The simulated plots don’t correspond to straight lines (linear) but to curved lines, so the added reach would not be proportional to the cost of the booster, which refutes Bové’s claims. Money may not be the sole factor To verify the claim that “the candidate with the deepest pockets has the odds in their favor” (in an election), we must compare the additional average reach of each of the various pages in relation to how much they are promoted.  The first graph compares two pages of widely differing popularity (49,000 followers versus 1,000), and the second graph compares two pages of similar popularity (1,000 versus 1,900). For an equal amount spent, the reach differs widely between the one with 49,000 followers and the one with 1,000. This implies that money is not the sole factor, and that other factors play a role. The page’s popularity before investment will impact the result. There is also an element of randomness: depending on the type of content, when it is circulated, as well as current trends, it will be picked up by the public to varying degrees. In short, the second graph shows that between two pages of similar popularity, the differences are negligible. José Bové’s assertion would therefore apply to equally popular pages, and in this situation, the one with the most money has the best chance of achieving visibility. This is why whe chose to rate “Mostly true”  Does spending money on Facebook win elections? That is the question facing Europe. How did our student tried to “decipher the Facebook algorithm ?

149,,,,M,,,,eufactcheck,,https://eufactcheck.eu/factcheck/mostly-false-does-immigration-cost-france-too-much/,"“France doesn’t have the means to accomodate more  migrants”, according to “Yellow Jacket” Damien Rieu",2019-02-01,eufactcheck,,"The signing of the Global Compact for Migration was greeted with many comments. Damien Rieu, an activist with the Génération Identitaire movement, “estimates” that France already spends 4.5 billion euros on immigration. He’s basing his figures on Nadine Morano statement.  The Global Compact for Migration triggered many arguments and reactions in France, especially on social media. Signed by France on Monday, December 10, 2018, it also reignited the eternal debate on the “cost of immigration.”  On Twitter, Facebook, and even YouTube, activists claiming to represent identity-based movements spoke out before the Compact for Global Migration had even been signed. Among them, Damien Rieu expressed concern about the signing of the pact in a video posted on December 5, 2018. A member of the Génération Identitaire movement (a nationalist movement in Europe) and the National Front, Damien Rieu warns that France “doesn’t have the means to accommodate more migrants.” According to him, the French state already spends 4.5 billion euros on immigration, including “1.5 billion euros on integration, 2 billion on unaccompanied minors, and 1 billion on state medical assistance to migrants.” The YouTube video has over 53,000 views. While these figures are accurate, they are not enough to draw up a balance sheet for immigration. Damien Rieu explains that he borrowed from Nadine Morano’s statement while she was a guest on the show BFM Story on Tuesday, November 27, 2018. Morano criticized the budget in the 2019 appropriations bill, particularly the 200 million euro increase to the budget for “integration.” Immigrants? Foreigners? Who are we talking about? The United Nations defines an immigrant as a foreign person, born abroad and residing for a year or more in a given country. In the immigrant category, then, we can include Erasmus students who stay longer than a year. The term “foreigner” refers to an individual residing in France who does not have French citizenship. Not all foreigners are necessarily immigrants (e.g. tourists), nor are all immigrants necessarily foreign (e.g. naturalized French). INSEE (the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) puts the immigrant population in France at 6.2 million in 2015, or 9.3% of the total population. 2.4 million immigrants, or 39% of this group, have acquired French citizenship. The foreign population living in France is 4.4 million, or 6.7% of the total population. (c) eufactcheck So, are these immigration numbers true or false? The figures given by Damien Rieu seem to be correct. The 2019 appropriations bill does include 1.58 billion euros for the “immigration, asylum, and integration” mandate. It includes the 303 program (“Immigration and Asylum”) that groups “public policy resources related to: foreigners entering, circulating, traveling, and working; the removal of individuals without legal status; and the pursuit of the right to asylum.” State medical assistance (AME), meanwhile, was estimated at upwards of 923 million euros in 2018. Created in 2001, AME is a framework allowing foreigners without legal status to access care, provided that they have resided in France for over 3 months. François-Noël Buffet, the Republican senator from the Rhône, estimates that more than 310,000 people currently receive this benefit. Furthermore, the Senate voted in early December to lower the budget for AME by 300 million in 2019. The health minister Agnès Buzyn expressed her disagreement with this decision. But this decrease could soon be invalidated by the National Assembly. On the second point raised by Damien Rieu, the Assemblée des départements de France (Assembly of French Departments) estimates that French departments accommodated 40,000 unaccompanied minors of immigrant background in 2018. If we factor in the cost of caring for a foreign minor through child welfare, estimated at 50,000 euros per year on average, this totals 2 billion euros.  But this level of spending for each unaccompanied minor is “unlikely,” says Catherine Wihtol de Wenden, a politician and researcher specializing in migration issues. Jean-Christophe Dumont, an economist at the OECD (in the International Migration division) believes that “the cost of providing aid to unaccompanied minors is virtually impossible to quantify, because there is no established budget item.” Experts say immigration is not only a cost But does immigration only have a cost? Jean-Christophe Dumont perceives in Damien Rieu’s video a “biased way of presenting things. … Immigrants pay taxes and consume like everyone else, while they receive less welfare than most French people.” Like Dumont, several other economists call for the costs to be weighed alongside the contributions. Catherine Wihtol de Wenden asserts that “immigration yields more than it costs.” As proof, she cites German growth in 2017, boosted by the welcoming of a million refugees in the previous year. A 2010 report from DREES (a department of the French Ministry of Health) led by the economist Hillel Rapoport estimates the net contribution of immigrants to public finances in 2005 at 4 billion euros. At the conclusion of a study on several countries in western Europe conducted between 1985 and 2015, three economics researchers at CNRS (the French National Center for Scientific Research)—Hippolyte d’Albis, Ekrame Boubtane, and Dramane Coulibaly—demonstrated a “beneficial effect of migration on the economy.” In particular, they observed a “positive effect on public finance: as public spending increases, so too does revenue in terms of tax and contributions.” But this positive effect of immigration is not automatic. Jean-Christophe Dumont believes “investment in integration is what leads immigration to have a positive impact on growth.” In short : Some of the figures given by Damien Rieu seem to be corrects. But the way he uses them are questionnable. We, students, had lots of debate about this fact check. But as, the video had around 60k views and as the claims is based on Nadine Morano figures (and the politician confirmed it to us on the phone), we decided to  fact check it… and find those assertions, without background are mostly false.   Read our “Behind the facts” to know all about how we did that fact check Leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions in the box below.
