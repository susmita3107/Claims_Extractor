The claim is false; the letter, which has various errors, was dismissed by the WHO as ""fake"".This Facebook post, which has since been deleted, shared the letter purportedly signed by a WHO representative to Kenya warning against the shipment of garments and items outside Europe, the USA and Asia so as to limit monkeypox infections.""We further recommend that countries receiving donated items of clothing from affected regions temporarily halt distribution of these items until their origin and circumstances surrounding their donation, purchase and shipment can be established,” the letter reads in part.The purported advisory, dated June 8 and published on Facebook two days later, proposed the destruction of donated and relief clothing items sourced from the listed regions within 72 hours. A screenshot of the false Facebook post, taken on June 16, 2022A day after the letter began circulating online, Gazeti Daily, a tabloid newspaper with no online presence and a reputation for printing inaccurate or unverifiable articles, published a report headlined: “Mitumbas from Europe may contain Monkeypox”. A screenshot of the false Facebook post sharing the tabloid’s front page, taken on June 16, 2022“Mitumba” is the Swahili word for bales or bundles and refers to second-hand clothes because they arrive and are sold to retailers this way.Below the headline was an image of a child covered in lesions as well as a cutout of the purported health advisory.The document, however, is fabricated.Not a WHO advisoryAt first glance, the letter contains various mistakes.Firstly, the word monkeypox is written as separate words – “monkey” and “pox” – inconsistent with how WHO spells the virus in official documents (see here and here).Secondly, the letter is purportedly signed by “Dr Rudi Eggers” in his capacity as “WHO Representative to Kenya”. Eggers, however, is not the current office holder —, according to his LinkedIn profile, he has not occupied the position since August 2021.The incumbent is Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, whose appointment was announced on April 4, 2022.WHO, itself, dismissed the advisory, urging the public to “ignore it”.“There's a fake letter in circulation on various platforms about Monkeypox. Ignore it,” WHO said in a tweet.

AFP Fact Check has debunked several claims here, here and here.According to WHO, the virus is transmitted from one person to another through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin or internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat, respiratory droplets and contaminated objects such as clothing.Mitumba tradeThe resale of imported, second-hand clothing in Kenya has become the subject of heated political debate after presidential candidate Raila Odinga made a controversial remark during a campaign speech. (see here and here).While calling for investment in the local textile industry, he said the imported garments had been “worn by dead people”.With a huge part of Kenya’s population dependent on the informal trade, politicians have always been cautious not to call for the total ban of second-hand clothes, like neighbouring Rwanda did in 2018.Kenya is one of the largest importers of second-hand clothes in Sub-Saharan Africa and a market report indicates that the industry contributes at least one billion Kenyan shillings ( about $8 million) to the economy each month.",,WHO dismisses “fake” advisory calling on ban of second-hand clothes to limit monkeypox infections,,,,,,

In addition to facial paralysis, it can cause hearing loss.The first paragraph of the Vancouver Times article reads: ""Justin Bieber now admits that he regrets taking the Covid-19 vaccine, saying that it left him with permanent paralysis in his face. Bieber made the confession to a close friend, who later leaked the information to the Daily Mail. Bieber reportedly plans on suing Pfizer for causing his paralysis, despite the fact the company is shielded from liability.""As evidence, the article links to a Daily Mail story reporting on Bieber's announcement via Instagram.

He added that Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be linked to environmental factors like stress, excessive fatigue or a lack of vitamin D.Anyone who has had chickenpox can potentially develop Ramsay Hunt syndrome, but it is extremely rare in children, according to the US National Organization for Rare Disorders.

Drugs are not being legalized, which would mean they could be purchased like cigarettes or alcohol."" He also said that while initiatives exist to help people with substance abuse disorders get access to drugs that have been checked for their contents, ""these aren't freely available to the general public.""With the three-year partial decriminalization pilot, Perrin said the province is moving toward treating substance abuse as a health issue, not a criminal justice issue.""Criminalizing people who use drugs isn't working. In fact, research shows it's making it worse,"" he said. ""Criminalization contributes to stigma, people using alone, and using drugs faster to avoid detection -- all of which increases risk of overdose death.""Mark Haden, adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health, agreed.He said in a phone interview that this pilot project marks a departure from the traditional criminal justice approach to drug policy.""The first drug law in Canada was 1908 so we've had over a century to reflect on the evidence that a prohibition approach does not work and a health approach to drugs does work,"" he said.He explained that people end up in the criminal justice system over very small drug possession charges and that by decriminalizing possession it will potentially reduce ""people's involvement in the criminal justice system, which is healthier for all of us.""He also said the project would hopefully increase health service spending. ""If we're reducing our expenses in the criminal justice system, hopefully we will increase our expenses in the process that actually works,"" he said.Thomas Kerr, professor at the University of British Columbia and director of research at the BC Centre on Substance Use, said the policy is a ""step in the right direction,"" but pointed out several shortcomings, including the fact that the program does not address the contamination of the drug supply or the possibility that the potency of drugs will change in response to the policy.""There are also some concerns that this policy could actually serve to increase risk if people make more frequent purchases of smaller amounts of drugs in order to avoid purchasing more than 2.5 grams and hence arrest,"" he said.The provincial and federal governments have pledged to monitor and evaluate the program and address any unintended consequences.In 2018, Canada became the first G7 country to legalize recreational use of cannabis.",,"Canadian province temporarily decriminalized, not legalized, some drugs",,,,,,

The virus can then be reactivated later in life due to triggers such as stress, causing shingles.Todd Hatchette, a professor with Dalhousie University's Division of Microbiology in Canada, told AFP that rashes caused by monkeypox and shingles can look similar, but they develop differently.He said rashes caused by shingles can have different stages of blister and ulcer crusts in different areas of the body, while the progression of rashes caused by monkeypox ""occurs at the same time in all areas of the skin.""""The 'pox' in the name chickenpox is likely the reason for the confusion,"" Hatchette said.Stock imageA reverse image search found the picture used by both TheHealthSite.com and Queensland Health is in fact a stock photo of someone suffering from shingles.It has been published on stock image site iStock alongside the caption, ""Skin infected Herpes zoster virus on the arms"".Below is a comparison of the image as it appears in the articles featured in the misleading post (left) and the image on the iStock website (right): Screenshot comparison of the image in the articles featured in the misleading post (left) and the image on Shutterstock (right)According to an archive retrieved from the Wayback Machine, the stock image was used in the article on TheHealthSite.com published on July 17, 2021, before the current outbreak of monkeypox cases in non-endemic countries.The stock image was removed from the article when it was updated on May 23, 2022, the archive shows.",,Posts misrepresent monkeypox and make misleading link with Covid vaccine,,,,,,

This is misleading; while scientists say some calculations have misrepresented the effect of methane on global warming, studies and data show cow emissions do contribute to climate change.""The emissions of cows are part of a closed and self-completing carbon cycle in the atmosphere,"" says a June 5, 2022 Facebook post titled ""The War on Beef."" ""The believer/activists don't explain that when a cow eats a plant it is vicariously 'eating' carbon from the atmosphere. They don’t explain that, when that cow exhales carbon dioxide or belches methane, the carbon in those gases goes back to where it ultimately came from -- the air around them.""The text is part of an article from a website called Farmers Against Misinformation. It implies cows have a negligible effect on the climate since no new carbon is created when they emit gases. Screenshot of a Facebook post taken June 14, 2022However, the claim ignores the planet-warming effect of cows' primary emission: methane, a potent greenhouse gas.""Cows convert carbon dioxide into methane, which is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide for as long as it remains in the atmosphere,"" said Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University. ""So the fact that the carbon atoms in the methane come from the atmosphere in the first place is entirely irrelevant.""However, while Allen said the ""contribution of cows to global warming is indeed well-documented,"" it is also ""very badly misunderstood.""""While there is much that is misleading in this post, I can understand why farmers are frustrated because there is so much equally misleading information out there exaggerating their impact,"" he told AFP in an email.Measuring methane's impactScientists say methane emissions, as well as other greenhouse gases, must be cut to limit the average rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- a threshold for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Much of that methane comes from agriculture.Data compiled by Climate Watch, a platform managed by the World Resources Institute, indicate an estimated 17 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions consist of methane. Around 40 percent of human-made methane emissions come from agriculture.Climate Watch cites data from the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme indicating the principal source of agricultural methane emissions is ""enteric fermentation"" -- livestock digesting feed. Graphic on methane produced by farm livestock ( AFP / John SAEKI, Adrian LEUNG, Laurence CHU)However, measuring methane's contribution to global warming is another matter.Methane is a more potent gas than carbon dioxide (CO2), but it stays in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time -- about a decade. As the Farmers Against Misinformation article notes, methane breaks down into CO2 and water in the atmosphere.While scientists agree that methane contributes to global warming, its different behavior and rate of dispersal complicate efforts to calculate methane's overall contribution to global warming in relation to other greenhouse gases.Methane measurements are often stated as a volume of ""carbon dioxide equivalent."" This figure incorporates ""global warming potential"" (GWP), a measure of how much energy one ton of a gas absorbs compared to one ton of CO2. GWP is typically measured over 20 years (GWP20) or 100 years (GWP100).However, scientists have warned this measure can distort the impact of methane. Livestock are the biggest source of agricultural methane, according to the UN Environment Programme ( AFP / Daniel Leal)""GWP100 can variously over- or under-state the impact of methane emissions depending on the historic trajectory of these emissions,"" says one article published by Environmental Research Letters.This in turn causes misperceptions about the effect of livestock emissions and how to deal with them, Allen said.Scientists have devised a new calculation method known as GWP*, which takes into account the high impact and fast dispersal of short-lived greenhouse gases such as methane. However, activist group Greenpeace has accused the beef industry lobby of seeking to use GWP* to dodge measures aimed at lowering emissions.Cutting methane would reduce warmingAt last year's UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), countries agreed to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. However, notable emitters -- including China, Russia, Iran and India -- have not signed on.Allen, who has co-authored various studies on measuring methane's warming effect, sent AFP graphs from Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute (ECI) that show how reducing agricultural emissions could help limit global warming.The graphs use data from PRIMAP-hist, a comprehensive dataset on greenhouse gas emissions. They indicate a rise in gas emissions from agriculture since 1850 has seen a corresponding rise in associated warming. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would held curb global warming ( Courtesy Myles Allen / ECI / )Bars at the bottom-left of the graphs show livestock accounted for about half of the agriculture sector's emissions over the same time period.""Right now, global livestock numbers and associated methane emissions are going up, causing lots of global warming,"" Allen said.However, he said countries ""don't need to reduce methane emissions to zero to stop methane causing any further global warming."" The ECI graphs, for example, indicate that reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 0.3 percent per year would help level off their associated share of global warming.""It would be enough to start reducing them by around 3 percent per decade, or halving over 200 years,"" Allen added. ""Methane emissions falling faster than 3 percent per decade actually reduce global temperatures.""The UN Environment Programme says scientists are experimenting with alternative feed types and different ways of managing manure to limit methane emissions. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposes various mitigation measures, including forms of land and livestock management.""Agriculture clearly has an important role to play in meeting our climate goals,"" Allen said. ""But as long as we continue to treat methane as 'equivalent' to a certain amount of CO2 when it clearly isn't, farmers will continue to feel unnecessarily threatened and misrepresented.""",,Article misleads on effect of cow emissions on global warming,,,,,,

Today they colour the map red and call it extreme heat,"" says one Facebook post with the maps published on May 25, 2022.The two side-by-side maps show similar temperatures over Sweden. One is green and dated 1986, while the other is orange and dated 2022.

The same applies to the site's searchable archive of weather reports, available for certain days in 2021 and 2022. The SVT weather maps also all have visuals showing suns and clouds, which is not the case for the orange map included in the posts.Second map from August 2021The second map pictured in the posts was not produced by the same media organisation.A reverse image search on the Russian search engine Yandex found the image circulated on Twitter in August 2021.

AFP has fact-checked numerous false claims about the WEF.""The extent of Arctic ice during the warmer months long has been a metric for climate-change alarmists,"" the article says. ""As WEF convenes its annual conference in Davos, Switzerland, the Arctic sea ice expanse so far this month is at a 30-year high, according to data from intergovernmental European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites"" (EUMETSAT).It attributed the finding to a post by author Tony Heller, who published graphs of data from EUMETSAT's ocean and sea ice observation satellite systems (OSI SAF). One of those graphs showed that the ""ice extent loss"" for May 2022 was at its lowest level since May 1989. Another showed the sea ice extent for May had risen compared to recent years to equal the level of 33 years ago.Heller's publications denying climate science are documented by the investigative group DeSmog. EUMETSAT's satellite data show sea ice has declined on average since 1980 compared to a reference period ( EUMETSAT / )Senior scientist Thomas Lavergne of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute in Oslo, an expert working with EUMETSAT, said that the WND article ""by cherry-picking those two years... gives a wrong interpretation of the OSI SAF sea-ice data.""In comments emailed to AFP, Lavergne said: ""In the Arctic, the sea-ice cover (area and extent) is declining in all months"" on average.""The decline is more pronounced in summer (September) than in winter (March) as shown by several satellite products that cover the last 40 years,"" he added.""This reduction in sea ice extent and area does however not happen at a constant speed, there are year-to-year variations: some years will have more sea ice than expected from the trend, some years will have less."" May 1989, for example, saw less Arctic ice than average, and May 2022 had more than average for those periods.To measure the impact of global warming on sea ice, scientists calculate the percentage change in its extent and volume compared to the average for a reference period of 30 years -- in this case, 1981 to 2010.

It added that in summer 2021 ""the expanse of Antarctic sea was well above average"" -- an apparent reference to sea ice.""The claim about September 2021 also seems inaccurate,"" Lavergne said.

Its decline is one of the impacts documented in reports by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Facebook post includes side-by side satellite images showing nearly identical expanses of sea ice in the Arctic. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Director Mark Serreze told AFP in an email the data shown in the post is correct, but it was taken out of context.He said the decline of sea ice in May is ""not large"" because, in winter and spring, the ice reaches the shoreline and cannot spread any further.""It is hence not surprising to find similar extents on the same date in the early and most recent part of the May record,"" he said. ""Having said this, extent (square kilometers of ice) is not the total story ... the ice thickness is much less today than it was in past decades, hence ice volume has strongly declined.""Serreze also said the ""key time of year to assess the evolution of the sea ice"" is the end of the melt season in September.""The September trend in monthly average ice extent is -12.7 percent per year through 2021,"" he said. Satellite records of Arctic sea ice extent go back to 1979.Average Arctic sea ice extent has decreased over decadesTo measure the impact of global warming on sea ice, scientists track changes in its average extent and volume over time rather than on single dates. They compare monthly levels to the average for a reference period of 30 years to calculate a percentage change or ""anomaly.""According to the Colorado-based NSIDC, the extent of Arctic sea ice for 2022 so far is noticeably lower than the extent for the reference period 1981 to 2010.

Yes, the sea ice waxes and wanes from year to year, but the overall trend is a decline.""She said a more fair comparison would consider ""two averages or central values, not two individual data points which could be higher or lower than the average."" Although some of the decrease since 1979 is ""due to long-term natural variations,"" Edwards said, ""the majority is down to us.""The IPCC says: ""It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land."" In a summary of one of its major reports last year, the IPCC said: ""In 2011–2020, annual average Arctic sea ice area reached its lowest level since at least 1850."" This ice block broke away from a glacier in Svalbard, Norway in September 2021 ( AFP / Olivier MORIN)The IPCC rated this according to its guidelines as a ""high confidence"" finding, indicating an eight in 10 chance that it is valid. It added that ""late summer Arctic sea ice area was smaller than at any time in at least the past 1,000 years (medium confidence).""Skeptics sometimes cite the circumspect style of IPCC's confidence ratings to cast doubt on its credibility. Some say, for example, that a ""medium"" confidence rating should not be grounds for asserting something as a fact.However, scientists typically avoid speaking of certainty and instead present their findings in terms of probability. And the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming is overwhelming.Scientists at the European Union's Copernicus observation program, which collates satellite climate data, have confirmed the Arctic sea ice trend.In an email to AFP, a spokesperson for the Copernicus Climate Change Service team cited satellite records from NSIDC and the European Satellite Application Facility on Ocean and Sea Ice that show a general decline in sea ice starting in 1979. The annual trend was similar even for just May, which is the focus of the Facebook post. This graph provided by Copernicus shows the declining trend in Arctic sea ice reflected in annual data for the month of May, compared to a 1981-2010 reference period ( EUMETSAT OSI SAF data, with R&D input from ESA CCI / )""There is day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year variability in the Arctic sea ice cover as in many other climate variables. Therefore, one cannot infer much, if anything, from the comparison of two daily sea ice maps 33 years apart,"" the Copernicus spokesperson said of the Facebook post. ""Changes in our climate can only be assessed based on long continuous time series.""When measuring sea ice trends, scientists also focus on particular times of the year when the change is most noticeable. They say the extent of the ice is generally largest in March and smallest in September.Edwards of King's College London said the Facebook post seems to highlight two days that have similar maps.""Why show just one day in May, not the average over all of September - which is the time of year we are most concerned about?"" she said. ""OK, let's assume that's because it's the latest data released. But why compare with 1989, not 1979, the start of the record?"" Changes in Arctic sea ice extent in September since 1980 ( AFP / Simon MALFATTO)Volume of Arctic sea ice has also decreasedScientists closely monitor the volume of ice -- not just its geographical spread.""The decline in sea ice is even more remarkable when we look at the total volume of ice. i.e. accounting for not just its area but also its thickness,"" said Michel Tsamados, a sea ice specialist at University College London, in an email to AFP. ""Models and observations concur also to show that the volume of ice has decreased by an even larger percentage.""A study citing data from the University of Washington's Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System mapped a dramatic decline in the thickness of April sea ice in the Arctic.The study found the ice declined from more than three meters to about two meters from 1979 to 2018. Tsamados said satellite data confirmed the model. A Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker at the North Pole on August 18, 2021 ( AFP / Ekaterina ANISIMOVA)There is another aspect of sea ice not covered by the image in the Facebook post, the Copernicus spokesperson said in an email.""Long-term sea ice changes are not limited to changes in sea ice concentration or extent,"" the spokesperson said. ""These changes have also affected the type of sea ice, with a marked decline in the area covered with multi-year ice, i.e. ice that has survived several melt seasons.""The trend is illustrated by data graphics on Copernicus's website.Tsamados said: ""Comparing a single day's sea ice extent 40 or so years apart is a bit like comparing the weather in France on May 13th in 2022 and 1979. Nobody does this, as of course, at daily timescales, variability is large and can hide the general trend.""AFP has previously debunked other inaccurate claims about Arctic ice and climate-related topics.May 23, 2022 This article was updated to correct a typo in the headlineMay 19, 2022 This article was updated to add quotes from Mark Serreze and to correct the name of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in paragraph seven.",,Facebook post misinterprets data to suggest Arctic ice is not declining,,,,,,

However, this is misleading; the images actually show the aftermath of a hailstorm, which is a common occurrence – and has previously sparked false claims – in Botswana, according to the country’s meteorological service. A Facebook post published on April 16, 2022, and shared more than 7,000 times includes four photographs of ice-covered roads and overcast skies. One image features a signboard with the names of towns found in the southern African country of Botswana. “Botswana is today experiencing snowfall for the first time ever.The snow was witnessed in the Central parts of the Country following a cold weather (sic),” read the post’s caption, adding that it was a “historic moment”. A day later, a fifth and separate image of a snowy-looking landscape with cars backed up on a road was shared on social media.“SNOW FALL IN SEMI DESERT BOTSWANA,” reads the tweet from April 17, 2022. “In a rare occurrence, people of Botswana experienced London weather as there were treated to snow fall during this period which normally is a hot season.

As reported by AFP, the floods in South Africa devastated the country’s southeastern province and killed at least 435 people, with more than 50 others still missing.All hailHail or hailstorms are not uncommon in Botswana, as mentioned in this Facebook post by Botswana Meteorological Services on November 2, 2020, and another on November 19, 2015.A 2020 storm destroyed hundreds of windows of cars and homes and killed cattle in Thamanga village.At the time, the weather service told The Midweek Sun newspaper that it was a “special case” as the storm had only affected one village instead of the whole region. Moreri told AFP Fact Check that the possibility of snow in Botswana was almost “zero” because of the flat landscape, unlike the mountains in Lesotho where it falls thickly. “We are in the tropical region, so the precipitation that we receive here is thundershowers with rain or hail - that is what we usually receive here.”As explained by Renee Duff, a meteorologist for online weather app AccuWeather, “unlike snow, sleet, freezing rain and graupel, which occur in colder weather, hail is most common in warm conditions”.",,"It was hail and not snow that coated parts of Botswana in April, weather experts said",,,,,,

You have to have a chain of custody. You need to know where it was discovered and under what circumstances or there would be no way to verify it.""Based on the lack of apparent evidence that it is genuine, Magness said it would not be worth submitting it for scientific analysis, and that archaeologists could not do this lacking provenance without violating their code of ethics.""I wouldn't waste my time trying to authenticate it,"" she said.

Screenshot of an online article taken on March 23, 2022The Expose published a similar article with the claim on March 3, 2022, and more examples of the claim appeared on Twitter and Facebook.The claim circulated as Moderna said that it was pursuing regulatory approval of its Covid vaccine for children under the age of six, and on March 17 asked the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a second booster shot of the company's Covid-19 vaccine for adults.The Expose article claims that because the study shows a 19-nucleotide portion of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a complementary match to a sequence patented by Moderna in 2017, two years before the pandemic began, the company must have created the virus which has now claimed more than six million lives globally.Moderna did not reply to several requests for comment.The study's lead author, Bala Ambati, said that the paper was intended to look into the cause of the outbreak, amid debate over the origin.""We are not casting aspersions on any person, company, or country, but rather raising the hypothesis that recombination in a human cell line with a lab leak could be the origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" said Ambati, an ophthalmologist and professor at the University of Oregon.According to Ambati, both lab leak and natural spillover theories are plausible regarding the origin of the coronavirus, based on available evidence. While the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown, recent preprints (studies that are not yet peer reviewed) support the idea that the virus jumped from animals to people in a seafood market in Wuhan, China in 2019.But the theory of a lab leak has not been ruled out.""The issue with most of these hypotheses is that they are not prospectively testable. We want to stimulate discussion amongst all concerned on both 'sides' of the issue to try to produce prospective experiments that can prove or disprove their hypotheses,"" Ambati said.However, Ambati's paper was met with harsh criticism from three other virologists who addressed the online claims.'Complete garbage'Yale School of Medicine immunobiology professor Craig Wilen rejected the legitimacy of the manuscript published in Frontiers in Virology, saying: ""This 'study' and 'hypothesis' are complete garbage and are more akin to a conspiracy theory than evidence or research.""Given that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30,000 nucleotides long, Wilen said that ""the idea that a 19-nucleotide sequence overlap proves anything is complete nonsense.""The doctor also quashed the idea that a present-day company could concoct an entire genome, as the Expose articles claim. ""Scientists are nowhere near being able to create a new viral species from scratch even if that was the goal,"" he said.Scott Kenney, a virology professor at the Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, said the odds of Moderna having created the virus are ""much less"" than the probability that the match occurred naturally.Referring to the genome of Covid-19 and Moderna's patented sequence, he said: ""The authors' stretch to connect the two subjects is quite dubious.""Both Kenney and Carlos Romero, a professor at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine who researches viruses, thought that the probability of the 19-nucleotide match occurring naturally was miscalculated in the study.""That information I do not consider reliable,"" Romero said, adding that it was ""preposterous"" to conclude that Moderna fabricated the coronavirus based on the evidence presented.""It just doesn't make sense,"" he said.Peer review process""Frontiers in Virology,"" the journal that published the paper, is a peer-reviewed publication. Its website says that ""peer review is handled by active researchers and scholars, carefully appointed to our Editorial Boards according to strict criteria of excellence, and who certify the accuracy and validity of research with their names on the published article.""Only one scientist, a veterinary researcher in China, is listed as the reviewer of the manuscript, a point noted as unusual by Yale's Wilen. ""Almost all papers have three reviewers so it's odd if this paper indeed has only one,"" he said.Kenney agreed, saying that while it varies by journal, most send manuscripts to two or three field experts and ""based upon their reviews and the editor's best judgment, it is revised, rejected, or accepted."" He disputed the findings of the study, saying: ""To me there are clear holes and potential bias in the data and the discussion and claims linking to Moderna appear to be a poor attempt to sensationalize this dubious research. Sadly any research presented in this manner is going to be further misconstrued and spread by mainstream media sources and groups that have other agendas.""""As scientists we have an obligation to be cognizant of the downstream effects of our research to public audiences, and not have hidden ulterior motives built into our discussions,"" he added.An addendum correcting reference errors and a typo in the manuscript is currently under review.AFP Fact Check has debunked hundreds more examples of inaccurate information about Covid-19 here.",,Scientific paper does not prove Moderna 'created' coronavirus,,,,,,

However, the clip has been shared out of context; the video was filmed on July 1, 2021, when Wike spoke in a television interview about the defection of former PDP governors.Social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle revealed the claim started circulating after popular Nigerian journalist Dele Momodu published a series of 10 video clips over two days of Wike being interviewed.   Screenshots of Momodu’s Instagram page showing the 10 clips, taken June 16, 2022“MR PROJECTS GOVERNOR NYESOM WIKE in action... OVATION MEDIA GROUP EXCLUSIVE,” reads the caption on one of the clips published on Instagram on June 14, 2022.The following day, another clip from the series of 10 was shared in a Facebook post that partly reads: “My 7% boyfriend Wike is indirectly telling PDP that if they don’t pick him as VP, he is leaving for APC.” More than 27,000 people have seen the video on the social network.APC refers to the ruling All Progressives Congress party in Nigeria. Screenshot of the false Facebook post, taken on June 16, 2022Wike recently lost his presidential bid to the country’s former vice president and fellow party member Atiku Abubakar. But since the governor belongs to a different religion and region from Abubakar, some believed he would have been a good running mate.Abubakar has since chosen Wike’s counterpart in Delta state, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.But, the video does not show Wike threatening to leave the PDP prior to losing the nomination.What Wike saidSince the reelection of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019, the PDP has lost some of its key members, including three governors who defected to the ruling APC. It was these defections Wike was talking about.AFP Fact Check’s knowledge of the interview allowed us to find the original broadcast of the interview in the archives of Arise TV on YouTube. The moment when Wike speaks about the defectors occurs 29 minutes and 40 seconds into the interview, which was uploaded to YouTube on July 1, 2021. In the full video, Wike explains why he thinks some of the PDP’s governors, including Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state, left for the ruling APC in 2020 and 2021. He argues that there was no justification for their defections, challenging them to be sincere about their reasons for leaving.“See the reasons why I am leaving PDP to join you. Tell me, are you willing to do all these things PDP didn’t do for me?” Wike said, referring to Umahi.“Not when I go on my own to see how I can be protected and be politically relevant and try to share my inadequacies, then I come out to say I am leaving PDP because this was not done when you can not practically prove it. So, the reason for [Umahi] to say why he left the PDP cannot be justified.”The abridged clip circulating on social media was published out of context to make it sound like Wike was talking about himself.Wike himself dismissed the claim that he threatened to defect.“This interview from 2021 was manipulated to give the false impression that I am leaving the Peoples Democratic Party,” reads Wike’s statement on Facebook. “I remain a committed member of the Peoples Democratic Party.”",,Video from 2021 does not show Nigerian governor threatening to defect for losing key nomination,,,,,,

This is misleading; while Epps, a supporter of former president Donald Trump, was in Washington in the lead-up to the attack, he told congressional investigators he has no ties to the FBI -- and evidence suggests he tried to calm the rioters.""Ray Epps is just one of 25 FBI agents dressed up like Patriots that instigated the January 6th fiasco,"" says the caption of a Facebook post published June 12, 2022. ""Just putting that out there since they won’t tell you that on the prime time hearings.""The post includes a video, viewed more than 6,600 times, that purports to show Epps before the Capitol insurrection. The clip was first published on TikTok, where it accumulated more than 240,000 views, and interest has risen again in June 2022 with the January 6 committee taking evidence about the fatal attack.Similar claims about Epps have circulated on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. Republican politicians including Congressman Madison Cawthorn and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, as well as pundits such as Newsmax host Greg Kelly, have promoted similar theories. Screenshot of a Facebook post taken June 14, 2022Allegations about Epps have circulated on social media, at political rallies and in Congress for more than a year. Their resurgence online comes as the congressional panel makes a case that the violence was the culmination of an orchestrated attempt by Trump and his aides to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Joe Biden.Epps, the owner of a wedding and event venue in Arizona at the time of the Capitol riot, was filmed in Washington before the attack. His photo also appeared on -- but was later removed from -- a section of the FBI's website seeking the public's help in identifying those involved in the insurrection.However, the US House committee investigating the Capitol attack has discounted what it called ""unsupported claims"" that Epps was an FBI informant.""The Committee has interviewed Epps,"" the panel said in a January 11, 2022 Twitter thread. ""Epps informed us that he was not employed by, working with, or acting at the direction of any law enforcement agency on Jan 5th or 6th or at any other time, & that he has never been an informant for the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.""How the theory spreadAllegations that the Capitol attack was a ""false flag"" operation -- political or military action that is carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent -- first circulated online soon after the tumult. But theories pinning the violence on the FBI and Epps took months to gain traction online.On June 14, 2021, a website called Revolver News published an article claiming there was a ""strong possibility"" the US government had ""undercover agents or confidential informants embedded within the so-called militia groups"" at the Capitol on January 6. The next day, Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired the theory, claiming on his show that ""FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol."" A screenshot taken June 15, 2022 shows a June 14, 2021 article from Revolver NewsSo-called false flag operations have been blamed by conspiracists for mass shootings in the United States and other international crises.Underpinning the January 6 allegations was the claim that unindicted co-conspirators -- people who are named or alluded to, but not charged, in criminal conspiracy indictments -- listed in federal charging documents referred to federal agents. Legal experts told multiple news outlets that assertion was baseless, as undercover operatives cannot be described in government filings as unindicted co-conspirators.But the conspiracy theory spread regardless. Multiple Republican politicians, including Greene and Congressman Matt Gaetz, shared it in their social media feeds.As reported by The Washington Post, Epps' connection to the theory appears to stem from a June 17, 2021 Twitter thread from a now-suspended user. ""On Jan 5th, the night before the infamous Jan 6th Capital Event, this Fed was caught on camera encouraging the crowd to raid the capital on the next day,"" says an archived tweet, which includes a still from a video. ""Who is Ray Epps?"" Screenshot taken from Archive.today on June 14, 2022The still resembles the video posted on Facebook and TikTok. The same clip, purportedly taken in Washington, was tweeted January 5, 2021.As the Arizona Republic reported, the clip appears to show Epps -- former president of the Arizona chapter of the Oath Keepers, a far-right group whose members were involved at the Capitol -- talking about plans to go inside the building.""Tomorrow, I don't even like to say it because I'll be arrested ... we need to go into the Capitol,"" he said in the clip.In another angle of the video posted on YouTube, Epps is shown saying that he thinks the protesters should go ""peacefully."" In response, the crowd shouts ""Fed"" repeatedly.Additional footage taken just before the riot shows a man resembling Epps pulling back and whispering in the ear of a man attempting to breach a police barricade.IMPORTANT: this is exact moment the siege of the Capitol building began as the two men in front ripped down a preliminary barrier & rushed officers who were behind a 2nd barrierThey then encouraged others to follow their lead. Officers appeared to be taken completely off guard pic.twitter.com/LE0a01PXBi — ELIJAH (@ElijahSchaffer) January 6, 2021 The theory that Epps was an undercover agent gained more traction in late 2021, when The New York Times reported that the FBI did have an informant in the crowd during the riot -- albeit one who ""traveled to Washington at his own volition"" and did not have prior warning of the attack.On October 21, Republican congressman Thomas Massie aired several clips of Epps during a congressional hearing. A little more than a week later, Fox host Carlson released a documentary series called ""Patriot Purge"" that again floated the idea that the insurrection was an FBI-led false flag operation. And in a January 2022 rally, Trump himself promoted the conspiracy theory.With the January 6 committee hearings under way in Washington, claims pinning the Capitol attack on Epps were back in Americans' social media feeds. Misinformation experts say it is part of an ongoing effort to shift blame for the actions of those involved in the insurrection.""Motivated reasoning is key to understanding this: The conspiracy theory acts as evidence that the people on one's political side or in their party aren't so bad, they were merely egged on by a nefarious deep state plot,"" said Adam Enders, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Louisville.

Multiple news organizations have reported on the matter.Epps' lawyer, John Blischak, told AFP that, in addition to meeting with the January 6 committee, the pair ""personally met with the FBI and answered all their questions.""""There has been no evidence established that Mr. Epps was a former FBI agent nor did he receive any compensation from the FBI,"" Blischak said in an email.The US attorney's office in the District of Columbia has charged more than 800 people in connection to the Capitol riot.

Ruto is a key contender in high-stakes national elections scheduled for August 9, 2022.

The public holiday also coincides with Father’s Day in Thailand.While yellow happens to be one of the colours used by Ruto’s political party United Democratic Alliance (UDA), the image does not show his supporters.

The posts claim it shows a potential conspiracy by the northern politicians against their own party, as the video was purportedly filmed after their ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party picked a southern challenger to contest the presidential race. However, this is misleading: the video has been circulating online since January 2022, months before parties held their presidential primaries.The video shows Atiku Abubakar, an ex-vice president who recently became the presidential candidate for the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP), in the same room with Senate President Ahmad Lawan and other politicians from the APC, including governors of three of the country’s northern Yobe, Katsina and Jigawa states. Abubakar hails from the northern state of Adamawa. A Facebook post sharing the clip, reads: “Northern APC governors and Senate President went to visit Atiku. These are people that just handed ticket of their party to Bola Tinubu and in less than 24 hours they are flocking together with the flag bearer of an opposition party.”It continues: “If this is not conspiracy then tell me what  it is.
